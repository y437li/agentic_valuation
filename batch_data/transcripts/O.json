At this time, all participants are in listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Barney Rosen of ARCP. Please go ahead. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Thank you Gary. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review American Realty Capital Properties First quarter 2014 earnings report. Joining me today are Nicholas S. Schorsch, Chairman and CEO; David Kay, President; Brian Block, Chief Financial Officer and Lisa Beeson, Chief Operating Officer. This afternoon\u2019s call is being webcast on our website at arcpreit.com in the investor relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at 4pm Eastern Time today. Dial in for the replay is 18773447529 with the confirmation code of 10044445. Before I turn the call over to Nick, I would like to remind everyone that statements in this earnings call which are not historical facts will be forward looking. ARCP\u2019s actual results may differ materially from these forward looking statements and the risk factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC report. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, ARCP disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today\u2019s call. First, Nick will comment on the quarter then David will discuss the closing of our recent acquisition Cole Capital, the recently announced spin-off of our multi-tenant business ARCentres as well as the future opportunities we see for the business. Brian will then review our operating results for the quarter, detail our execution on several strategic balance sheet initiatives and walk through our earnings guidance for 2014. Lisa will then provide an update on the integration and synergies of our operations across our businesses as well as possible larger scale opportunities we see in the market. Now I would like to turn the call over to ARCP\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Nicholas S. Schorsch. Nicholas Schorsch : Thank you Barney. Good afternoon everyone. Let me make a couple of key points on the quarter and on the business before I turn the call over to David. Our portfolio acquisitions were extremely strong with $1.75 billion closed and in our pipeline. Our team is performing as planned with cash cap rates of approximately 8% on these acquisitions and GAAP cap rates of nearly 8.25. our first quarter earnings came in exactly where we expected at $0.26 per share of AFFO, despite the fact that there was less revenue due to the timing of the Cole closing, we are confident with our guidance for the full year of 2014 of $0.13 to $0.19 per share and a forward quarterly run rate of $0.29 to $0.30 per share. We are realizing the identified $74 million of annual savings from the synergies identified in the merger and our singular focus and [Inaudible] business coupled with Cole Capital provides our shareholders with both a stable and durable income while creating opportunities for dynamic growth within our platform. Finally I continue to be extremely pleased with how the management team has developed a cohesive working relationship. In fact we anticipate accelerating the succession planning process for David to take the rein to CEO of the company in the near future. With that, I would like to turn the call over to David. David Kay : Thank you Nick and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased with the progress we have made on acquisitions and capital raising. And I am excited about the opportunities we see going forward for the business. We invested over billion dollars of real estate on the balance sheet during the first quarter inclusive of the previously announced Fortress and Inland portfolios at a cash cap rate of 8.02% and a GAAP cap rate of 8.24%. These included 224 properties comprised of 78 individual transactions. In addition we have closed and/or have under contract over 700 million in real estate for the second quarter. Together first quarter acquisitions with our projected second quarter acquisitions were totaled $1.75 billion at an average cap rate of 8.26% and a cash cap rate of 7.92% and a weighted average lease term of about 10 years. This puts us firmly on track for achieving our previously stated guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion of self-originated balance sheet acquisitions for the year. In addition to our self-originated acquisitions, we are currently in negotiations to acquire several large corporate sell lease back portfolios which could materialize in the future. Let me now turn to Cole Capital. Looking at our capital raising results, Cole Capital raised approximately $900 million during the first quarter putting us firmly on pace to achieve our previously discussed $3.1 billion capital raise target for 2014. During the quarter we successfully closed out two non-traded funds and subsequently launched two successor funds. Typically the non-traded funds have a fund raising ramp up period in the beginning stages of the fund\u2019s life cycle as we obtain selling agreements with broker dealers. We have made great progress with obtaining these agreements. During the quarter, we completed the capital raise CCPT 4 which focuses on retail with over $2.9 billion of equity raised. We currently have three funds in total raising capital. Capital raising for non-traded REITs is cyclical by nature with a majority of the capital being raised as the program matures. During the quarter, our acquisitions team acquired $420 million of real estate on behalf of our managed REITs comprising 84 properties and 51 individual transactions. Inclusive of the balance sheet acquisitions I just mentioned, our total acquisitions for the quarter were $1.45 billion comprised of 308 properties in a 129 individual transactions, that\u2019s roughly an average purchase price of $11 million per transaction which as what I have been describing as one of our competitive advantages. We can buy an up-market smaller transactions which have far less competition and better cap rates, ultimately yielding better spread to the company. Lisa will discuss the overall portfolio in greater detail but I will say that I am pleased with the progress we have made on the acquisitions front, as well as to growing diversity and quality of the portfolio. Now, let me quickly give you update on our previously announced multi-tenant spin-off ARCenters. We are on target for a mid-June close. We continue to believe this transaction will unlock value for our shareholders. The assets continue to perform very well and believe represents a very solid foundation for growing this platform. Upon the completion of the spin-off ARCP will be focused on our core net lease strategy. ARCenters as a new standalone and publically traded company listed on NASDAQ will focus on growth and consolidation opportunities that exist within the multi-tenant sector. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial results for the quarter and our future objectives. Brian Block : Thank you David and thanks to the participants joining today\u2019s call. In addition to reviewing our results for the first quarter I\u2019ll also discuss the strategic initiatives we have undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet. Let me remind everyone, that given the timing of the ARC Trust IV as well as the Cole closing first quarter results include just under two months of the collectivities and almost the full quarter of ARC Trust IV. Revenues for the first quarter were approximately $321 million and AFFO was a $147.4 million for the quarter or $0.26 per share fully dilutive. The year-over-year increases were due to the various acquisitions consummated over the past 12 months. Our current run rate based on AFFO per share fully diluted is between $0.29 and $0.30. We made a lot of progress improving our balance sheet on multiple front store during the quarter. Specifically we reduced our overall cost of borrowings as well as our secured debt, lengthened our debt maturities and improved balance sheet flexibility. One of our stated objectives was to continue to lengthen term which we will continue to do. For example, during the quarter we successfully added long-term debt to the mix when we secured $1.2 billion of ten year fixed rate interest only financing consisting of $693 million of mortgage debt and $500 million of senior unsecured notes. In addition, we successfully refinanced $730 million of secured mortgage financing. We used proceeds received from our five year unsecured note offering to replace this two year debt. We also used proceeds from our three notes to pay off roughly $1.3 billion on the whole credit facility which had a one year maturity. As of the end of the quarter our weighted average interest rate was 3.7% which includes our line of credit with a weighted average maturity of 5.7 years. This compares favorably when compare to our peers which have an average maturity of 5.9 years and an average debt cost of 4.8%. Increasing our borrowing capacity is another area where we are making significant progress. We have been in negotiation with our lenders to upsize our credit facility in excess of our current 3.15 billion capacity and have received verbal commitments from our largest lenders as well as from new relationships. These efforts will further improve our liquidity and provide additional flexibility. With that I am going to turn the call over to Lisa. Lisa Beeson : Thanks Brian. Looking at the net lease portfolio at the end of the quarter our occupancy remains at 99%; 51% of the portfolio tenancy is rated investment grade and an additional 20% is rated. As a reminder these are actual rated entities and not shadow ratings or parent ratings. We expect the portfolio to generate growth of 1.2% before taking in account CPI based escalators or percentage rents. These statistics exclude ARCenters, the multi-tenant portfolio that we will spin-off later this quarter. Over the past four months, we have successfully integrated over 300 individuals from the multiple entities into one cohesive enterprise. Our accounting systems are fully integrated as well. We expect to exceed the previously announced 70 million in cost savings subsequent to the integration of the Cole platform. We anticipate 34 million in synergies to be recognized within the first six months following the close of the acquisition and an additional 40 million in the subsequent six months for an annual run rate of 74 million. We continue to explore ways to optimize our business to increase these synergies further. Now I wanted to cover ARCenters and the growth opportunity we see. We have a great portfolio. 78 properties with 11.7 square million feet, 96% occupied with 4.7% comp store NOI growth. We also have very strong household metrics with three mile population of 69,000 and household income of roughly 70,000. As a result of our spin-off announcement in form 10 filing, we have had a lot of inquiry regarding potential transactions. There are currently 19 public companies in this space and 11 with an enterprise value of less than 3 billion. The G&A of these small public companies is roughly 100 basis points. Further there are many more private portfolios. The small cap companies are trading at 15.5 times AFFO multiple and the large caps are trading at 19.5 times. The ability to combine platforms and drive synergies is meaningful. Also our current structure makes conversations easier without creating social issues. By retaining the 25% interest in the company, we are aligned in creating shareholder value. With that I will turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions. Gary? Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Hi Good afternoon. Nicholas Schorsch : Good afternoon Paul. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Nick, earlier I guess a couple of months ago, you talked about the equity markets and the fact that you would not issue equity below I think you mentioned 14.50 or so. And so I was wondering given the opportunity set that you see before you, given current market conditions, can you give us an update on what you think an appropriate share price is to tap the equity markets, just to hear your thoughts? Nicholas Schorsch : Sure. Paul, as I said before, we are not happy with where our stock price is trading right now. We think that there is a lot of value that will be unlocked in the next 30 to 45 days with the Spinco of our multitenant assets which will certainly drive value and the other side of it is, we are seeing some very interesting opportunities in the marketplace per transactions where cap rates are starting to back up. So we do take the stock price into consideration with any acquisitions. But to be clear, we are not anxious to issue stock at $12 or wherever it is at the moment or $13 or $13.5 a share, we think we are way undervalued and we think our currency is not being fairly viewed. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay, a related question, do you have a buy back in place? Nicholas Schorsch : Yes we do. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : And so what are your thoughts in terms of pulling the trigger there? Nicholas Schorsch : We have not done so. We had a $250 million or $500 million; I am not sure what the exact amount is of our buy back, it\u2019s been in place for quite a while. We haven\u2019t executed anything on it in four, five or six months. Obviously it is something we have available to us if our stock continues to stay cheap. But we are also looking to delever our balance sheet overtime that would be inverse of buying back stock. So we don\u2019t want to be delevering our balance sheet at the same time as, and buying back stock. We do think our stock is cheap. Now just to be very specific, on the first note, we as a management team have borrowed $2 million worth of stock in the last six weeks and probably will continue to buy stock at that level. Currently we are blacked out but we were actively buying stock to both in our common and in our preferred and we believe that\u2019s the right thing for us to be doing with our own capital. Brian Block : Paul, you can see also the cap rates that were achieved in the market place at north of 8%. So we are obviously, even though we are trading at the levels that we are trading there, significant accretion between where our shares are trading and the 8% that we are able to achieve in the market place. Nicholas Schorsch : I would rather be a buyer of stock myself personally than have the company buying back the stock and levering up. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay, great. Finally Nick, I don\u2019t follow all of your businesses very closely but maybe you could just provide an update on what\u2019s happening in terms of consolidation of the broker dealer networks and how that might impact ARCP? Nicholas Schorsch : Sure. The broker dealer space that we are, we have closed the deal to buy Cetera that deal did close about a week ago. So we have about 10,000 advisors in our system that directly is a positive on ARCP. ARCP sells some products on those platforms, not a lot but some. We continue to see very robust capital markets for our Cole Capital Markets business and that business continues to grow and our enthusiasm for the independent channel is no way [Inaudible] I know some of our peers have felt like that\u2019s not that important of their business. It is an important part of our business. We expect to raise over $3.1 billion, this year David and Lisa and Brian and our teams have been actively working with the broker dealers. We\u2019ve recently signed many, many big selling agreements outside of the group that are cap owns, broadening their distribution constantly, significantly broadening of one was this Cole and that area is expanding and that\u2019s one of the things I mentioned in my comments. So we expect to see that Cole Capital will continue to be dynamic growth aspect of our business as well as our asset management revenue for years and years to come. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay great thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Hey good afternoon guys. Do you guys say, we are at a point right now where even though your past critical mass in terms of size or I guess because of the fact that your past critical mass in terms of size might [Inaudible] sensitive focus on the one off organic pipeline rather than pursuing these potentially large entity level deals especially given where stock price is today? Nicholas Schorsch : Yes I mean that is where we\u2019re focused. That\u2019s what we have spoken about, I mean we obviously did a lot of transactions, we are achieving cap rates that are frankly that are north of where our peers are because of the way that we\u2019re acquiring. We continue to look at larger sale leaseback opportunities and built to suit opportunities for the same reasons because we think that we know that we have opportunities there because of our scale, we can take down larger blocks of assets and really get better rates because our peers can\u2019t really participate in that. And so we\u2019re able to play at both ends of the spectrum. We\u2019re clearly focused on those areas much more than we would be in the M&A front. Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay and then is future M&A dependent on where your equity is trading at that point or I guess I am trying to get a sense of the level of discipline you would have if you are to get a multi-billion dollar deal? Nicholas Schorsch : I mean at the end of the day, cost of capital is always your overriding factor and so we look at every single opportunity both in terms of granular acquisitions, in terms of sale lease backs, built to suit or M&A transactions with our cost of capital in mind. Our goal is ultimately to deleverage the balance sheet and continue to do so. And so obviously that\u2019s an important factor as well. As we continue to look forward into the future and look at opportunities we will evaluate each of them on an independent basis trying to obviously add accretion each time. And that takes our cost of capital in the place and the factor as well as how we want to deleverage. Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay. And just a last question for me, for your year to date acquisitions; can you give us a sense of what percentage of those have grown your cash flow? Lisa Beeson : Very few of them as a percentage there were a couple embedded in our portfolio that we acquired via Fortress but those were all bankable ground leases but otherwise there are no ground leases associated with the acquisition. Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Great that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot. Nicholas Schorsch : Thank you Jon. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please go ahead. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : Good afternoon everyone. David or Nick may be to start this way. Can you give me a sense as to of the acquisitions you guys closed already year to date? What\u2019s the composition by property type retail versus the industrial and office? David Kay : Let Lisa answer that because she has the schedule sitting right in front of us. Lisa Beeson : Sure. So you know as I look at first and second quarter about 30% is retail on the single tenant with some on the multi-tenant, 5% on the multi-tenant perspective and the remainder was in office and industrial and 16% office and 41% industrial. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : Okay. And then I guess. David Kay : When we say industrial we mean distribution, these are non-industrial buildings. So I don\u2019t want to confuse, people use these terms very loosely, we don\u2019t do industrial so we are doing to either built to suit some of these built to suit where we\u2019ve built the building like the Nissan or the M&M, Mars facility and some of these are Home Depot or FedEx distribution facility. And if you look at some our peers they will use that almost in literal retail because the users, the retail user like Kohl\u2019s or like CDS or an Amazon and they will call it retail, it\u2019s really distribution. So we don\u2019t do industrial so it\u2019s industrial, retail and office. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : Okay. And then it relates to the amount that is either closed or under contract for \u2013 Is the entire amount expected to close in the second quarter or is there some risk that? David Kay : Yes. Yeah what we\u2019ve laid out is all expected to close with a high degree of confidence during the second quarter. Nicholas Schorsch : And more that\u2019s just what we have as of today. So that\u2019s not \u2013 that will certainly be a lower number than where we expect to be. Lisa Beeson : And it also does not include longer built to suit type programs where they are expected to close into the third and fourth quarter. Nicholas Schorsch : Nor does it include anything for the non-traded REITs. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : Well that\u2019s good Nick trying to understand. So the CCPT tender, the acquisition that\u2019s depending on that is not included in these numbers? Lisa Beeson : Actually that is included in here. That transaction is included in here, a couple of $100 million associated with it is included that should be closing concurrent with the expiration of the tender in the middle of May. David Kay : But it\u2019s on the balance sheet it\u2019s not going into a non-traded REIT. Brian Block : When Nick was referring to with assets being acquired into the non-traded REITs are not included in that numbers. So these numbers that we are giving are just what\u2019s going on to the balance sheet. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : Okay. And then just on the, just out of curiosity about many thing, one asset that did not close and have not expected to close the Inland portfolio seems extremely large, what was it? David Kay : AT&T, it was a large facility in Atlanta and it is in St. Louis and it was a building that AT&T in the middle of due diligence noticed they were vacant. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : Okay. And then the last question for me. It is just may if you could give us an update on a built to suite business and how the progress is moving on deals on that front? David Kay : It\u2019s been actually very strong and I think one of the advantages that we\u2019ve had is the size of our company we are able to talk to other big corporates as a peer now. When you go to present a build to suit as a take out, we are not doing construction or construction lending; this is purely take out positions. We now have the size and scale to really talk to the big corporates as a peer, we\u2019re also many of these company\u2019s largest landlord already. And so progress is going very well. We have a team of guys who are working on, going out and visiting those corporate, talking to the CFO\u2019s and the guys who run the real estate groups within the big corporations, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, our pipeline right now is about $800 million. The closing of those typically takes 12 to 24 months depending on the type of facility that it is, but we as Nick mentioned we\u2019ve done some really great deals with FedEx, Amazon, Mars, ConAgra many of the big names that you would want to see, good credits. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : And so are those deals included in sort of the acquisition flow or is there a separate view on those? David Kay : The ones that are included in the acquisitions flow are really from a pipeline perspective would be in their future forecast. In the numbers that we\u2019ve given closing in the second quarter or under contract to close in the second quarter, we may have A, built to suite or two in there that is being completed during that quarter. But one that was by example initiated during this quarter that won\u2019t close for 18 months that\u2019s nowhere sort of in our numbers right now, it\u2019s just in our future pipeline of deals. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : Okay Great. Thanks a lot guys. David Kay : Thanks Chris. Operator : The next question comes from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : Hey guys. So it looks like private capital fund raising slowed in March. You know David what\u2019s that attributed to? David Kay : You know as we\u2019ve said on the call, we initiated two new funds and there is really a ramp up period where you are going to obtain selling agreements of the broker dealers. During that period you are not raising as much capital, most of the capital in these funds is actually raised as the fund matures and towards the back end where there is sort of this rush to get dollars. And so this is fairly typical, we actually put out of free writing perspectives that showed where Cole Capital raises have been in the past and you can track those with the launches of the fund. So as we closed out two funds and replaced those with two new products, you\u2019ll see that now selling agreements are ramping up, we\u2019ve got 9,000, 10,000 advisors and certain ones now and as we continue to get selling agreements that will ramp up and then dollars will come in. And so again we are in our view we are right on track to the numbers that we have forecasted for full capital and we remain confident that we\u2019ll hit those. Nicholas Schorsch : Mitch we are actually we are probably a month ahead of where we expected to be for example, CCPT which was the Cole Credit 2 is now raising almost $2.5 million a day from the standing start less than 2.5 months ago. So that\u2019s a very rapid ramp up and that\u2019s partially because of what we talked about it earlier was the diversification of the Cole platform. Cole is a lot more diversified than it used to be, it used to sell primarily through about a 130 broker dealers, now it\u2019s more like a 160. So that\u2019s helping ramp up that sales efforts, and the first quarter was much better because those deals closed out quicker. So it\u2019s really, it all averages out in the total for the year. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : Great and then sorry... David Kay : Well I was just going to say we are very pleased with how Cole capital is operating. Management is doing a great job out there, the wholesalers are doing a terrific job and they\u2019ve really been operating better than expected as Nick said. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : And then on that top how would you characterize the Cole team in general? David Kay : You know I would characterize them as fully integrated and obviously very capable of performing what they are supposed to do. They had a great business before the merger, we\u2019ve continued to sort of refine how we do certain things. From an underwriting perspective they are world class. From an acquisition perspective, they were as dominant as ARCP and so the two teams collectively you see the acquisition results, I mean I think that they speak for themselves to some extent we\u2019ve done an awful lot of transactions, we\u2019re obtaining the cap rates that we have slated to obtain and we are not stretching. We\u2019ve underwritten nearly $10 billion of deals in the first quart and the billion and a half that we\u2019ve closed and have under contract to close in the next quarter is a pretty typical sort of percentage. And the team is operating very well. Our accounting systems are fully integrated as Lisa mentioned and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased. We are spending a lot of time in Phoenix from the management perspective and I think that that\u2019s a good thing. We have I think a rejuvenated intensity there that Cole frankly had not seen in probably past year or two and I think that the work product and the effort is directly related to the results that we are achieving. Nicholas Schorsch : Hey Mitch as one of the thing you have to look at and that is that, look at the results, when you look at the performance of David and Lisa\u2019s teams and how they are performing as far as buying, the velocity these are 1Z, 2Z, I don\u2019t know or was it 380 properties David, with over 90 transactions. There is no other peer in this industry that\u2019s putting up eight caps with investment grade assets with nine and 10 year durations in this kind of tonnage. I mean this is big value and this is 1.7 billion in four months and that includes two months we were shut down in January and February, we were in the middle of the merger. So besides the merger with all the things that we have been going on, they put up a 1.7 billion of assets and cap rates that are 100 wide at industry standards. All I can say is it\u2019s the reason why I feel that our succession planning is moving ahead of schedule. That\u2019s the exact reason, it did not show right there, it\u2019s just their fee, they performing exemplary. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : Great. I appreciate that Nick. And then David just some thoughts on the sale leaseback opportunities, is there specific industry or a sector that that\u2019s skewing toward? David Kay : No, I mean, we like retail, I mean that\u2019s been the bulk of the portfolio at roughly 50% or so and I think that we will continue to be focused on that, there is a lot of opportunity there. And retail as you know stands across everything from quick service restaurants, restaurants to bread and butter retail. And so I think we are seeing it across that entire platform and we have, we are the landlord to a lot of major companies as I said. And so I think that the dialogue that we have now with our size is vastly different than it was a year ago. And it\u2019s a different company, our capabilities are different, we can execute, we talked about last quarter we brought a lot of the diligence and the legal underwriting, et cetera in house, we have a full team of attorneys that do our work, so that we can not only control the timing of it, but the quality of it. And I think that\u2019s been attractive for a lot of corporations who are working to do leasebacks. I think you are going to see higher rates in that as well because there is not a lot of companies that can pull down $300 million, $500 million, $1 billion type transactions with single products and because of our skill, we can do that now. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : Great. Thanks guys. David Kay : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Thank you and good afternoon. David Kay : Hi Dan. Nicholas Schorsch : Hi Dan. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Hi. I guess first question for Brian on the G&A I think is about 49 million, how much of that was related to Cole and then kind of what are you expecting for that line item going forward for rest of year, should we see that start to take down a little bit or how should that, how is that going to progress? Brian Block : Yeah Dan. I would point out that we view Cole Capital as a different segment of business. So I think we have pretty good transparency in the footnotes specific to the real estate versus Cole Capital. So if you parse through the G&A and I am turning toward right now, you would see that roughly see here $20 million of the total G&A relates to the fund raising business and the balance is to the real estate. How I see that trending is to the extent we are raising more capital in subsequent quarters, there is a direct correlation to additional G&A vis-\u00e0-vis conditions and variable cost that are directly relating to the selling activities. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. So you anticipate kind of this run rate to kind of kick up from here a little bit? Brian Block : No, I would say it goes down in general as we are realizing the synergies that we spoke about earlier. But my only point is when we are successful with the fund raising whether it\u2019s the end of second quarter, the third quarter, I don\u2019t want to use this as a trend right now because the variable cost that hit the G&A directly relating to the sales will increase G&A overall. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. Yeah. I can remember that with Cole, and we had a lot of companies report today, so I am sorry I missed that footnote. And then the second question is kind of on the credit facility, I noticed that your spread to LIBOR is I think it\u2019s almost 300 basis points. But was kind of curious why that seems to be so high relative to some of your peers, is it just the share of magnitude and then kind of going forward, what\u2019s your anticipation for paying that down, what type of debt maturities are you looking to pair that down with as you bring more acquisitions onto the balance sheet? Brian Block : Dan you are referring to the older revolver, now we have the new revolver. And revolver itself is 140 over and the term loan is 160 over. So that\u2019s been, that\u2019s already been updated when we increase the facility to 3.15 billion those new terms went into play. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. That makes a lot more sense then. But as far as... Brian Block : And they don\u2019t ratchet anymore, so you won\u2019t have them in a higher rate as the leverage rates are flat. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. As far as the 2.4, what do you, do you think about putting more on the credit facility as you get more lenders in there or what is your thought process on terming that out? Brian Block : Yeah I mean our thought is to go back to the bond market I think we did a large bond deal 2.55 billion last time, there needs to be some space in between, rates are very attractive right now, on the long term side we will keep the next deal towards the longer end of the curve. You are seeing some of our peers issue 10 year paper, 30 year papers being done, there is a nice sweet spot on some sevens too which fits nicely into our maturity schedule. So we will term it out. I think that we want to do issuances as we have said previously of the larger variety, airing on the side of 700 million to a billion, maybe just north of a $1 billion. And so you should see that as we progress, we are looking to upsize the line that does not \u2013 that\u2019s not just to go ahead and load it up, it\u2019s really to provide ourselves with more flexibility and more liquidity which I think the agencies like. I know the agencies like that and I also think that it gives us a lot more flexibility when we are looking at sale leaseback transactions or things of that sort. So we will continue to term out the debt in the bond market, I think we just want to do it at a measured pace with a little space in between your deals. And so we just recently did a deal so we need to be patient but you will see hit the market hopefully a good time. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay makes complete sense. And then moving to Cole Capital, I remember when you guys acquired it and you talked a lot about how AR Capital had relationships in the broker deal world and Cole Capital had relationships that maybe you guys didn\u2019t have. Was just kind of curious is that falling into place in terms of getting new relationships and specifically do you have selling agreements with LPL as well as an AIR price? Brian Block : Yeah. Let me answer the first part of the question first which is yes, that is bearing fruit I mean there were some crossovers but many not and we are getting selling agreements with ones that we had not had before \u2013 we did not have. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Did not have a merit price? Brian Block : Right, we did not have a merit price and previously we do, we are working with LPL, we just recently got Linking as an example. And so it is progressing very nicely and as I said before we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the management that\u2019s there in working hard and the wholesalers are doing a good job and we continue to see ramp up in the funds. And so I know that there was question I received a couple of emails based on the [Inaudible] reported whereas the volume, this is very typical, this business and you would see cyclicality and particularly at the launch of the funds. And so you will start to see ramp ups and again as the funds start to mature, you will a lot of dollars come in. And so we are just approaching this as we have any other year and we are very, very comfortable with the funds we have outlined as our guidance to raise. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. So Cole Capital is selling on a merit price but they are not selling LPL? Brian Block : No, vice versa, Cole Capital has never sold on a merit price. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. Brian Block : And it is selling on, it is continuing to sell as it was before on LPL, no change. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s the largest... Brian Block : It also is broadening, the third thing you asked is also correct, it is broadening its distribution to more broker dealers it did not have before as expected, so the number of broker dealers itself there is probably in large part by 30. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. I will [Inaudible] fire, the sirens are Brian Block : It\u2019s an ambulance on Park Avenue. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : All right. And then two more questions sorry. On the \u2013 as far as the acquisition side, you raised 880 million in private capital, you only put 420 million to work, why not try to match that better, why not add more properties to the non-traded versus the balance sheet in order to time it more appropriately? Lisa Beeson : Go ahead David. David Kay : I was just going to say the acquisitions are there I mean they\u2019re teed up, it just takes a little while, some of those are built to suit and there is an allocation process but the acquisitions are there, so it is more of a timing issue but you will see the acquisitions flow into those bonds over the next quarter or so. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay. And then lastly Nick you have a seven year agreement with ARCP as CEO. Was just kind of curious why the discussed success plans is, is that something you would go back and change the agreement or how should we think about that, given that you only signed it just a couple of months ago? Nicholas Schorsch : No, that was always a part of my agreement Dan. I think we have discussed this before in the call you may not have been on. But my contract was to be Chairman, the Executive Chairman of the firm from the very beginning and that I was going to be Interim CEO and that\u2019s the way my contract is written and the idea was that I would stay in place and dedicate a substantial majority of my time through the point of which we had a deep bench in the C suite and we wanted to have a more robust bench then a company of $4 billion or $5 billion which would have been I guess almost any one of the four people we have now sitting in the C suite. And the idea was that overtime we would be, I would be able to take a more of the role of a Chairman and allocate capital no different than what you see with Mort Zuckerman or with Sam Zell or what you see with John Malone and that was always the construct of my contract and David was brought in Lisa and Brian and then Rich as part of the board\u2019s concept from the very beginning It was always contemplated that we needed a very robust management team to run a company of this size, realize we are almost double the size of our newest peer and we are doing more than double the amount of acquisition than our newest peer is doing. So, we look at as part of the process. So, at this point we are seeing very good results and I wanted to be clear with the market that at our current pace we had originally hoped to be in a position to start the transition in early \u201815 we may be able to start the transition even sooner than that. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay, well hopefully that means you are still going to stay in the calls, they won\u2019t be the same without you. Nicholas Schorsch : I won\u2019t leave, don\u2019t worry. And I am not selling my stock either. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Thank you. Nicholas Schorsch : Thanks Dan. Operator : The next question comes is a follow-up from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Thanks. Sorry if I missed this Lisa, could you talk about where the incremental cost savings are coming from? Lisa Beeson : Sure, so it\u2019s a combination of streamlining a bunch of the organization a lot of it is the elimination of the duplication of sort of joint corporate expenses, there is also a lot of very expensive people who are no longer part of the company on a go forward basis that\u2019s another sizable advisable portion of the saving but it really is coming across the board from third-party service providers you know paying closer attention to expenses given the knowledge that we have on the Cole Capital side, it really is all the process aboard. Auditors, board fees, I mean it\u2019s all of those kind of expenses that we are able to drive the expenses down. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Great, thank you very much. David Kay : Thanks Paul. Operator : The next question comes from Bradley Teets with Kovack Securities. Please go ahead. Bradley Teets \u2013 Kovack Securities : Thank you. When you structured the spin-off of the centers property, do you consider the reason for doing that more to break up income versus growth properties or just to have the pure triple net lease in the original ARCP and the multi-tenant in the new spin-off? David Kay : I think it\u2019s a combination it\u2019s ARCP will become a pure play net lease durable income company, growth in that company will as Nick pointed and I pointed out earlier is in the 1.5% sort of internal range and then additional growth from Cole Capital. We see the spin-off as the multi-tenant grouping a higher growth as we pointed as Lisa pointed is over 4.5% same store comp, trades at a different multiple, there is lots of consolidation opportunities as she pointed out earlier and I think it\u2019s really the combination of creating value for our shareholder as well as becoming a single focused net lease pure play company which I think is something that the market should embrace. Bradley Teets \u2013 Kovack Securities : Thank you. David Kay : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from [Panos Marcolas with Helenica]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon gentlemen. Nicholas Schorsch : Good afternoon. Unidentified Analyst : I have two very simple questions probably related, first question is in the issue how the market comparing ARCP to Realty Income it seems like ARCP is getting short end of the stake. My concern is what is management doing to achieve a more favorable comparison and at what stage will we see the valuation levels from the market where to put into street terms when are going to get any respect? David Kay : You know it\u2019s an excellent question in fact on the last call somebody asked where are the things that are happening better than expected or sooner than excepted and what are the ones that are happening at a slower rate and my answer was, the markets embracing our company is definitely coming at a slower pace. We spend a lot of time on the road talking to dedicated refunds talking to investors potential investors and I think you know one of the things hopefully that this quarter will do is really clarify and simplify the story, sure we had a partial quarter because of the acquisitions that we have made during the first quarter but I think this is really a true \u2013 you are seeing a true run-rate now for what we do. You are not seeing any major acquisition added to this, you are seeing the granular deals that we have talked about and are executing and the cap rates that we are able to achieve. Our debt levels are really the only state that I can point to that isn\u2019t the same or better than every other as a peer. And I would say that hopefully with time obviously we will bring in our leverage and we have talked about that for the last two quarters now and we will continue to work towards that. We will focus on our blocking and tackling which is the basic buying at good cap rates and buying the right assets, keeping our mix and majority of investment grade and hopefully the market will respond with getting on the road. Many have suggested maybe you should go out and issue equity and it will give some of these REIT funds and some of the other investors a chance to buy stock and that might actually move your stock in an upward trajectory. I think the answer to that is we are only going to issue equity in accretive manner when we have deals, we don\u2019t like our stock price right now as Nick said. I don\u2019t love it in the 13\u2019s more or less in the 12\u2019s. We trade at a couple of 100 basis point yield differential from a dividend perspective, we trade at multiples below where our peers are. We are just going to keep doing the same things that we are doing in executing and getting out there and telling the story and hopefully the market will respond. We are not running a stock, we are running the company and the company is producing shareholder value right now by doing the things that we said that we are going to do and hitting our numbers and you know that\u2019s what we are going to continue to do. Unidentified Analyst : I think that there is a consistency and this is the second question I have and it\u2019s more along the lines if you comment on this. I think there is a consistency in fixed base conference call that we need to go back to organic growth, this is a large acquisitions now you just said deleverage and give that opportunity to market to see a better performance from the company itself even though I won\u2019t say right off the bat but you have done a phenomenal job with growing in revenues and your AFFO. My question is, are we going to go back to organic growth as the norm for the rest of the year or are we looking to getting bigger than where we are at now because the two would be \u2013with the statement you just made earlier that kind of fee suppose that we are going back to an organic growth model for the company. David Kay : Yeah I would say that we are not going to grow just for the sake of growth. I mean the cap rates that we have been able to achieve and the deals that we have been able to acquire are transactions that makes sense from an accretion standpoint, they make sense from an integration standpoint and a capability standpoint. We are going to continue to grow at our self-originated deals would be, what we do quarter in and quarter out. Will we look at other opportunities, absolutely we see every deal just about out there on the street that\u2019s a good thing for our shareholders, they should want us to continue to look and see what\u2019s out there but right now we are focused on becoming a pure play net lease company that has a great capital management business in Cole Capital which will provide some growth to us above and beyond the 1.5% plus the CPI escalators that we are going to get in the leases and that should yield a pretty solid return for our shareholders. If you can grow your business up a single digit to low double digit and provide nearly 8% coupon which is where we are trading on a dividend basis, that\u2019s a pretty solid return and for me I\u2019m still scratching my head much like you are as when do we sort of get that respect of the investment community that says, this platform is pretty rock solid, if you look at our free riding perspective and compare us to all the other net lease companies, I would never say discouraging about them but just stack us up, our leverage is higher and we are addressing that, other than that our metrics are every bit as good or better than every other company there and the thing that we can do better than them is our ability to acquire on an individual basis and buy at yield. If you look at where our peers are and I didn\u2019t plan on sort of going into this much detail but if you look at reality income that you just brought up, we just bought their acquisition and big blocky transactions at seven caps. I believe that our portfolio and the acquisitions that we just made at eight caps are far better investments. If you look at [Inaudible] NNN where you focus on either non-investment grade companies that they are buying leases too or you are focused on lower yields or we\u2019re buying at better yields and we are buying better products and we can do that because of the way that we are set up. We have a factory, it\u2019s a machine to acquire assets and we figured out the mouse trap to do that in, we have phenomenal underwriting capabilities and we can close because we have very thing in house. I think the market will ultimately get that and as I continue to tell the story and get out on the road and our team continues to perform that\u2019s hopefully what happens. This isn\u2019t a sales pitch or anything like I have been accused of being very savvy et cetera. We are excited about the business we have a great business. We are able to achieve pretty good spreads, we just got investment grade rating but our cost of debt should continue to come down, unlike most of the other companies in our peer set which are already at their maximum ratings and their spreads are staying about the same. So, I think all those things are positives for our company and hopefully the market will grab hold of that at some point and say these guys really do have a pretty unique business and a unique platform and they are not going to screw it up. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Lucas a follow up from Capital One. Please go ahead. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One : Yeah David, just a quick one, can you remind us what the mechanics are of the spend in terms of the SEC interaction and shareholder interaction?

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to [Barney Rosen], Director of IR of ARCP. Please go ahead. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review American Realty Capital Properties\u2019 second quarter 2014 earnings report. Joining me today are David Kay, President; Brian Block, Chief Financial Officer, Lisa Beeson, Chief Operating Officer, Richard A. Silfen, General Counsel, and [Michael Ryder], Senior Vice President. This morning\u2019s call is being webcast on our website at arcpreit.com in the investor relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 1 pm Eastern Time today. Dial in for the replay is 18-77-344-7529 with a confirmation code of 10049338. Before I turn the call over to David I would like to remind everyone that statements in this earnings call which are not historical facts will be forward looking. ARCP\u2019s actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and the risk factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC report. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports ARCP disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today\u2019s call. First, David will provide an update key corporate initiative followed by comments on the second quarter. Brian will review our operating results for the quarter, detail our execution on several strategic balance sheet initiatives and walk through our earnings guidance for 2014; Lisa will update us on operations across our businesses including Cole Capital and acquisition activity. Now I would like to turn the call over to ARCP\u2019s President, David Kay. David? David Kay : Thank you Barney. Good afternoon everyone. My experience at ARCP these past 7.5 months has been amazing. I would not be more excited about my Senior Management team and the future prospects of this company. From afar it may appear at times our rapid growth is hard to understand. I can assure you however that everything we do is directed towards a singular objective to create value for our shareholders. So, why am I excited? I can tell you that it has a lot do with our people, our culture the opportunities we see in the marketplace and our competitive advantages. Today we have roughly 30 billion of assets managed by more than 425 talented people located strategically throughout the country. We have built this company with the future in mind and we are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as they arrive. While I expect not all of our decisions will be met with universal approval I can assure you that our management team and Board of Directors act only where they sincerely believe that such actions will add value over the long-term. For the past several months I have spent a considerable amount of time with the investment and research analyst community. I have been asked hundreds of questions and many express a sense of incredulity namely how is this possible? For example, I am often asked how can a company of our size consistently invest in properties at cap rates meaningfully better than our competitors. There is no alchemy here I assure you. In part, our ability to invest at prices better than our peer group result from our origination team being largest in the industry. We see and evaluate a very large volume of properties and our sheer size firstly assures us that we see every marketed transaction a large number of off market deals and all the largest sales that fit our strategy. We have already originated, put under contract or closed and underwritten more than $6 billion for the first-half of the year which happens to be more than the assets under management of many of our peers. Moreover our pricing advantage also lies in the diversity of properties in which we invest. The mixture of traditional investment grade long-term leases, high quality non-investment grade tentative properties and medium term vintage leases which afford us relatively higher yields in a broad spectrum of industries create better overall returns, broader diversity and ultimately better portfolio metrics. The key to our growth has been to construct a large talented team of acquisition professionals proficient in the origination of both individual properties, small portfolios while at the same time being expert at underwriting large sale lease back deals such as the Red Lobster transaction we closed yesterday. In addition, we have a seasoned unit of professionals that focus on build-to-suit transactions in our space, another way in which we are able to enhance our returns while carefully managing our risk. Our team sees every deal in the marketplace we are often the first to see the deal. In many cases not only we\u2019re afforded first look at these potential transactions but we also have last look as well. This gives us a competitive advantage and deep market insight as to the pricing and structure. Another obvious difference between us and our peers is our broker-dealer Cole Capital which provides us with the unique access to an alternative equity source. This enables us to generate EBITDA without the need for balance sheet leverage, with key selling agreements currently in place for LinkedIn, Cetera, Cambridge, First Allied and our largest partner LPL give me great confidence that our capital raise will be consistent with our projections. Over the past quarter Cole Capital has been a source of many questions but I will let the results for the coming two quarters speak for themselves. Our team is working hard to build upon the Cole brand and believe we are well positioned given our very strong strategic relationships with key broker dealers coupled with our prior performance to grow this segment of our business. Before I turn the call over to Brian who will speak about our financials, I would like to talk about the equity offering we completed this quarter. I am pleased that we raised the money and deleveraged the balance sheet. With plenty of uncertainty in the global economy heading into the summer reducing our leverage was the right choice, although not the most popular choice. I am confident that our management team and the board made the right decision to raise equity and reduce our overall financial risk. Certain circumstances require hard decisions and there will be many more in the future. Our decision \u2013 our decisions will always come back to the same fundament first principal; are the steps we are taking designed to improve shareholder returns while managing risk appropriately? In October this year I will become Chief Executive Officer of ARCP. As with any large company there will challenges as well as opportunities but the foundation laid over the past several quarters position the company for the future success. We have exceptionally talented and dedicated Board, executive management team and employee base, a uniquely entrepreneurial culture, the most diversified property portfolio, a modestly leveraged balance sheet, the most investment grade tenant concentration, the highest occupancy percentage, the longest weighted average lease term, over 12 years nearly $12 billion of unencumbered assets, strong coverage ratios, one of the lowest average cost of debt in the industry and experienced origination and underwriting team and solid credit metrics. ARCP is positioned for success. It\u2019s now not about creating this foundation but building upon it. I could not be more excited about the prospects for this company and I look forward to our future together. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian who will review the financial performance. Brian Block : Great, thank you David and good morning to everybody. Our second quarter results are in line with our expectations. Revenues for the period were $382 million and AFFO was a $198.6 million or $0.24 per share fully diluted share which represented 26% increase from this period last year. We are confident with our guidance range for the full year of 2016 of $1.13 to $1.19 per share. I\u2019ll speak more to this earnings guidance shortly in my prepared remarks. Over the last three months we have significantly delevered our balance sheet as a result of our common stock offering and improved our liquidity and flexibility with our extended and upsized line of credit. As of June 30th, our weighted average interest rate was 3.7% which includes our line of credit with a weighted average tenure of 5.5 years. We will continue to lengthen our maturities and look to complete a sizeable bond offering during the latter part of this year. We have continued to refinance short-term duration and high cost merger-related assumed debt and we can further our efforts as an unsecured borrower. In the second quarter $282 million was refinanced which coupled with the first quarter activities result in a year-to-date total of about $1 billion of refinancing. This $1 billion had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.7% and remaining average duration of two years. We are targeting an additional $550 million to be refinanced in the third quarter which will further allow us to enhance our credit ratings, our stability liquidity and balance sheet metrics for the long-term. The weighted average coupon associated with this for remaining $550 million is about 6% which creates enhanced arbitrage relative to our current cost of borrowings. We utilized our credit facility to complete the acquisition of Red Lobster yesterday. The $1.4 billion to be generated from the sale of our multi-tenant portfolio will be used to pay down our line of credit as well and extend our overall capacity. We are in active dialog with the rating agencies with respect to a bond offering and will see these bonds re-rated at the highest possible investment grade by the agencies. Based on the recent strategic actions we have taken to reduce leverage de-risk our balance sheet, lengthen debt maturities, increase overall unencumbered assets and extend our credit facility our discussion with the rating agencies will include the potential for future upgrades of our credit rating as our company matures. Across the organization we are fully integrated and are realizing identified synergies of about $77 million on an annualized basis with roughly $30 million already accomplished today. We have about 425 employees today across the country working cohesively and we are in tandem to implement a long-term strategy as a unified front. Additionally, our internal operations continues to strengthen. The synergy created by the innovation of the Cole team and the adoption of new technology has allowed to be more timing efficient in our financial reporting. In fact, this enhanced scale allowed us to move up the timing of our 10-Q filing and earnings call as a result of these improvements by roughly a week. Let me turn to our earnings guidance numbers. On page six, of the [free running] prospectus that was filed today there is an AFFO guidance reconciliation that takes actual first and second quarter results on AFFO basis plus the run-rate based on Q2 and adjusts it for the major pro forma items. These adjustments include the closing of the Red Lobster portfolio which occurred yesterday, the sale of our multi-tenant portfolio to Black Stone which should occur by the beginning of the fourth quarter, the closing of our pipeline balance sheet acquisitions for the remainder of 2014, which brings the total acquisition to our forecasted $4.5 billion and interest savings expected on the debt to be refinanced during the second-half of 2014. The second-half estimated AFFO projected run rate of $533 million, includes the full quarter results of properties acquired during the second quarter \u2013 sorry includes second quarter as well G&A for the second-half of the year of approximately $80 million which is inclusive of commissions and cost synergies. This is consistent with our full year estimate of total G&A including non-cash compensation of approximately $176 million. The run rate AFFO also includes an estimate for Cole Capital based on our projected $3.1 billion of capital raise and $4.9 billion of acquisitions into the managed funds. The projection results in AFFO for Cole Capital for full year of approximately $120 million. Before turning the call over to Lisa I should take a moment to welcome Mike Sodo who is joining our team on August 5th as a Senior Vice President and Director of Finance Report and Treasury. His experience and expertise will complement our team of financial professionals while enhancing financial oversight reporting controls and in treasury functions as well as our investor outreach. With that let me turn the call over to Lisa. Lisa Beeson : Thank you Brian, let me start by discussing Cole Capital. We currently have three non-listed REITs raising capital with total equity capacity of $8.5 billion. As we\u2019ve articulated in the past, capital raising for traditional non-traded REITs is cyclical in nature with a majority of capital being raised as signed agreements are executed and programs mature. Looking at our capital raising results Cole Capital raised approximately $161 million during the second quarter for a total of just over $1 billion for the first six months. We\u2019re making good progress towards our capital raise goal of $3.1 billion as we are ramping up the sales of CCIT II, and Cole V more quickly than their predecessor funds. We also hit a notable milestone for Cole Income NAV, our continuously offered non-listed REIT that provides daily valuation and daily liquidity when it recently surpassed a $100 million in capital raised. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress obtaining selling agreements with large broker dealers such as Schwab, LinkedIn and Cetera. This includes adding LPL our largest partner last week and we anticipate an agreement with CCIT II later this week. Historically the relationship with LPL has accounted for substantial capital raise and we expect to see similar results with all three products up and running on their platform. Our team is geared up to capitalize on these relationships including sponsoring and attending the LPL Sales Forum in August where we will have the opportunity to reintroduce Cole Capital with the power of ARCP as the parent company. [Finrock] recently submitted a revised proposal for RN1406 to the SEC. We\u2019re fully supportive of this regulation to leading to pricing on customer accounts statement for non-traded REITs and other direct participation programs. The new rules which are expected to be implemented in 2016 are inline although slightly later than what we expected. We believe this proposal is a good process and we\u2019re supportive of the statement enhancements in providing further shareholder transparency. We also believe this transparency will be effective in the long-run increasing the number of financial advisors who sell these products. Consensus is that capital raising in the non-traded space should be very high for 2015 in advance of this implementation. During the quarter on behalf of our managed REITs our acquisitions team acquired $751 million of real estate comprising a 134 properties. In July we closed an additional $128 million of acquisitions and have a further $1.34 billion of acquisitions under contract we aim to close by year-end. So far this year we\u2019ve acquired replacement of contract $2.6 billion on behalf of Cole Capital. We remain confident in our ability to invest $4.9 billion of assets for this year for our managed funds. Let me now turn to ARCP\u2019s acquisitions and portfolio. Our acquisitions remained strong during the quarter, bringing the total of combined closed and pipeline transactions on the balance sheet to approximately $4.25 billion as of July 28. For the second quarter, this included $835 million of acquisitions comprised of a 165 properties in 72 individual transactions. We only have $250 million of transaction activity left to hit our $4.5 billion of guidance. Our team of 26 professionals has continued to source investment opportunities. Granular transactions, large scale leaseback transactions and build pursuits. As planned with cash cap rates closed or under contract as of July 28 of approximately 7.7 and GAAP cap rates of 8.7. Our team is able to use the relationship to effectively source acquisitions directly with sellers off market from brokers and through traditionally marketed opportunities. For a single retail tenant portfolio 66% of the transactions were direct with the sellers or off market. For office and industrial 41% were direct with sellers or off market. Our real estate credit and legal under writing team of 50 individuals which remains separate and independent from our originations team continues to review every potential acquisition against key criteria and due diligence requirements. As a result of this deep bench we are able to source, underwrite and close transaction on a granular base as quickly and efficiently. Now let me turn to our balance sheet portfolio at the end of the quarter, pro forma for the Red Lobster acquisition which closed yesterday and excluding the multi-tenant properties being sold prior to the fourth quarter. Our occupancy remains at 99.8%. 46% of the portfolio tenancy is rated investment grade and an additional 22% is rated. We expect the portfolio to generate growth of 1.2% before taking into account CPI based escalators or percentage rents. 62% of our rental revenues are derived from retail and restaurants, 23% from office and 15% from industrial and distribution properties. Our ten largest tenants including Red Lobster on a GAAP rental revenue basis accounted for 31% of rental revenue. Our next ten tenants account for approximately 12% of rental revenue bringing our top 20 tenant mix to 43%. Yesterday we closed a $1.5 billion sale leaseback transaction for Red Lobster. This transaction was structured whereby we selected the best location and divided the properties into multiple lease pools with long-term cross defaulted leases with financial covenants and restrictions on leverage and assignability. We spent a significant amount of time not only underwriting the real estate but working with Golden Gate and Red Lobster management team to understand their business plan. We acquired this portfolio at a 7.9 cash cap rate and a 9.9 GAAP cap rate. The portfolio has EBITDAR to rent coverage greater than 2.2 times and should improve as sea food cost normalized and the management team drives efficiencies. We\u2019re buying this portfolio at 82% of replacement cost in markets with strong demographic. Darden recently spent 350 million during the past seven years on remodel and $1.4 billion in overall CapEx over the past ten years. Another major transaction we announced this past quarter was the sale of substantially all of our multi-tenant shopping center portfolio to affiliates of Blackstone real estate partners for 1.975 billion. The sales of our multi-tenant properties furthers our strategy of simplifying our story as a pure playing net lease REIT, improves our occupancy rates, decreases capital expenditures, eliminates $600 million of secured debt and reduces operating complexity. We currently plan to close this transaction towards the end of the third quarter, beginning of fourth quarter. The sale of the multi-tenant portfolio and the purchase of the Red Lobster portfolio provide for accretion which maximizes value for our stockholders. We use our upside extended credit facility to complete the acquisition of Red Lobster and will repay the line with proceeds from the multi-tenant sale proceeds. In the interim we will be generating significant NOI from both portfolios. David I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. David Kay : Thank you Lisa and Brian. Before we take questions I wanted to touch briefly on corporate governance. As Nick outlined in yesterday\u2019s stockholder letter this will be one of his major initiative undertakings as he transitions into his singular role as Chairman. We have made great strides towards improving our corporate governance in the past month and we have a great number of initiatives underway. As we take these next steps we are focused not only inwardly on governance but also outwardly so that the governance rating organizations take note of our continued progress. Through these efforts we are demonstrating our commitment to mitigating risk and creating greater transparency while ultimately creating long term value for our shareholders. We hope you can appreciate the transparency provided this quarter and we continue to focus on supplying the most meaningful information to you about the Company and our guidance. As always we are available after these calls for detailed discussions. In an effort to maximize your time and allow everyone a chance to ask questions today please keep this is in mind. With that I will now ask the operator to open line for question. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Juan Sanabria, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just a couple of questions on slide six of the presentation, to get to your AFFO per share of above 14 highlighted there, are the adjustments just for the stub period, as in Red Lobster $44 million is just as of from August onwards? David Kay : Yes, that\u2019s actually what\u2019s going to occur in the second half of the year. So this results in where we should end up for year-end 2014. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and are the Red Lobster and multi-tenant portfolio numbers, are those net of any interest expense or how should we think about that? David Kay : I will let [Michael Ryder] answer that. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Hey Juan. Yes, all of the numbers that you see on page six under the pro forma adjustments for each item there, that encapsulates any revenue coming in or going out and the associated interest expense. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then can you just give us a little bit more color on the interest savings and kind of how that\u2019s derived? David Kay : Go ahead Mike. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Sure, so post Q2 you can see on the left there\u2019s about $650 million or mortgage and some other debt that\u2019s being refinanced as well as along with our amended credit facility the rate dropped substantially to what you see on the left hand side of the page. So the revolver is priced at LIBOR plus 135 and our term is LIBOR plus 150. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay and then how should we\u2026 David Kay : We\u2019ll look to term out debt long term towards the latter portion of the year so we will build up the line. In the interim we will pay the line down once we get the proceeds from the Arc Center sale and then we will look to term the rest out in a longer term unsecured bond deal. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay and so that longer term unsecured is not included in this correct? David Kay : It will be towards the very end of the year. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay and what are you guys thinking in terms of term and potential size of that unsecured offering? David Kay : We currently have no maturities in the seven year time frame. So we\u2019ll look probably for a portion of that but we continue to look for longer term and so with 10 year available and a recent 12 and 15 year done in the market place, we\u2019ll look at all of those see where the pricing is, and see where those maturities fit our current maturity schedule. Last time we did 5s and 10s primarily we also did the shorter obviously that refinanced the core capital debt. So we\u2019ll look to lengthen the maturities. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then on the corporate governance, is Nick\u2019s compensation is part of the Board\u2019s view also going to be looked at in order to as you sort of mentioned earlier tick the boxes with the third-party governance parties? David Kay : Nick\u2019s contract, no, included his transition out of CEO already but as with any compensation committee they will do a full view of everything but Nick\u2019s contract is fully in play. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay and can you just talk a little bit about what you guys think you may do with regard to compensation on a go-forward basis that would kind of tick the boxes with firms like ISS? David Kay : You know again our Board has a committee established and they will use the consultant as they have in the past. I think the high point now is that Nick, myself and Bryan have opted to take nearly all of our cash compensation which is everything but our base salaries which are, as you guys know fairly small relative to total comp, we decided to take all of our cash bonus in the form of stock as well as the additional stock obviously that we get. So those are the \u2013 that\u2019s what we are doing right now. The comp committee with continue to evaluate compensation and obviously with my appointment to CEO in October they\u2019ll review my compensation with regards to that. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay great and one last question from me CapEx I saw $47 million of I think it was CapEx highlighted in the 10-Q, is that related to the shopping center portfolio that is going to be sold and can you talk about expectations for a normalized triple net CapEx number we should be thinking about? David Kay : Yeah, that was related to the multi-tenant and obviously significantly smaller in terms of that. I can turn that over to Lisa to talk about. Lisa Beeson : Sure and it also includes a portion of the capital as part of the build to suit transactions we do where it\u2019s put forward as capital expenditures instead of just flowing through on an acquisition basis. So it\u2019s both pieces of the \u2013 both pieces. David Kay : I think another item to note one is that we continue to \u2013 our office as a percentage of the entire portfolio continues to shrink now just above 20% considerably down from where it was six to nine months ago. So as that continues to shrink it should have a substantially less CapEx as compared to obviously what you would see in terms of single tenant retail and restaurant. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you very much. David Kay : Thanks Juan. Operator : Our next question is Mitch Germain, JMP. Please go ahead. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : Hey, great quarter guys. David Kay : Thank you Mitch. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : I saw you referenced a number of advisors, I think it was may be 45,000, just curious I know Lisa mentioned LPL added \u2013 where was that from, is there, can you put that in context where you were last quarter? David Kay : Just to put I mean in the broadest of terms LPL represent 12,000 advisors and they just come on this past last week and will bring on the second fund with them on Thursday. So we are very excited about that, it\u2019s a big uptick. We have had a significant number of new firms as well and I think one of the keys to this business is not only are we building it for 2014 but we are building it for the future. Cole Capital previously focused very much on the top 20 broker dealers and we have because of the lengthy due diligence processes, because of the merger et cetera we have been able to really focus a lot of the effort on the bottom 200 and so we have collectively we will have a much, much broader broker dealer network out there on a go forward basis. And I think that will ultimately provide much more upside in terms of the volume of capital that we can raise and ultimately the volume of capital that we can deploy for 2015 and beyond. So I am very excited about the opportunity for this and we have really expanded the network. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : Great and obviously you are near that $4.5 billion target for acquisitions. I know the focus is raising equity in the PCM business, putting capital to work there but does anything \u2013 is there any possibility that you would surpass that $4.5 billion? David Kay : Not really our focus is really on sticking to what we said we were going to do which is we believe our leverage levels at the $4.5 billion number are the right number. We are not going to raise equity for the remainder of this year and we have a significant amount of capital that we will be able to deploy in the Cole Capital business and generate a significant amount of EBITDA there and we are anticipating the majority, vast majority of all the property to be directed into those managed funds. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : And then the leverage profile on the managed funds David or may be Lisa, I think you guys had referenced you are going to run the balance sheets there a little bit differently, is there can we kind of is there is a certain leverage target that we should look at in terms of how you are looking to run the funds going forward? David Kay : Yeah, those funds are typically leveraged fairly modestly at around 40% and I think that one of the keys to that business is that capital comes in obviously it ebbs and flows and properties come in and they ebb and flow and they don\u2019t always match-up exactly although that has been obviously our history in terms of being able to buy very granularly, raise $10 million buy $10 million, raise $5 million buy $5 million. That is what we you know hoped to do obviously. It doesn\u2019t always work out that way. So leverage may tick-up in an interim period for weeks or month, may rise to 50%-55% and drops back down to potentially below 40% and could be 30\u2019s as capital comes in. So you can see those things ebb and flow at any given time. What\u2019s really important is where anticipate ultimately the funds being at a leverage level of around 40% at their close and so there is no difference in target. They are very conservative funds, they are paying north of six yield right now and those investors are looking for durability of income and stability and that\u2019s what we are providing to them. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : Great. David, my last question is just an update on CCIC, I know I believe you are pursuing strategic alternatives as previously announced, where does that stand please? Thanks. David Kay : You know Wells in the process of marketing that. I don\u2019t know the ultimate progress on that but a liquidity event could be possible there, may take place by the end of the year or very early 2015. It\u2019s a very, very strong portfolio, great credits very long-term leases there is a lot of suitors for it. From what we understand it is about 75% or so office, very high quality. Obviously our directive has been reduce our overall office exposures it\u2019s not something that would fit in our portfolio at all but a very, very high quality portfolio that could trade at a very good level and be a great portfolio for another company. Mitch Germain \u2013 JMP Securities : Thanks, great quarter. David Kay : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is Chris Lucas, Capital One. Please go ahead. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : Good morning everyone. David Kay : Hey, Chris. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : David could you maybe walk through a little bit about the synergies on the G&A and where you stand how the headcount is evolving and where you expect it to be sort of by year end as you think through sort of the continued integration? David Kay : Sure as Brian and Lisa had touched on, we currently are at about 425 employees or so. We have realized about $38 million in synergies to date. We are targeting the mid the mid upper 70\u2019s in terms of where we would like to be, close to 80 if we can get to. We have had some real progress this past quarter Lisa and her team, Kurt McAlister at Cole Capital, just the full spectrum of employee and senior management within this firm have done just an exceptional job at really producing synergies. As Brian said the second-half of our estimates include cash G&A of about $80 million that is really getting the remaining portion of those synergies squeezed out to get close to that $80 million and I think that you know we are making great progress in that respect. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : Okay, thank you. And then is it relates to the refinancing I\u2019m I have got two different numbers I think I am looking at here. I think maybe it was referenced 550 million at roughly 6% and then the slide six mentioned $650 million which one are we looking at? David Kay : Go ahead Mike. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Yeah, the $650 million is what\u2019s anticipated in the second-half of the year, is a little bit cost over with the date in terms of what actually got repaid prior to the end of the year. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : Okay. And then does that also include the redemption of the series D as part of that number? Unidentified Corporate Participant : Yes, it does. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : Okay, and then on the \u2013 maybe this is for Lisa, as you look at the proposed rules, how do you expect the business to evolve as it relates to the PCM business. How do you expect that rule to impact? How these assets are these funds are actually sold? Lisa Beeson : We actually think in the long-run that it\u2019s going to help grow the business pretty significantly when you have that greater transparency we believe there will many more financial advisors who will look to sell the non-trade product then there they have been before. You know also if you think back to just a recent Wall Street Journal article the non-traded space given the success of many programs most of which have been led by the management here in at Cole have also resulted in strong sales and we think that they will continue under the new proposed rules. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : Okay, and then just kind of picking up on an earlier question as it relates to the number of advisers that you are currently utilizing other than the Cole sort of program. How does that compare to the number of advisers that Cole had sort of before the merger? Lisa Beeson : So the way to think about this is Chris is it\u2019s a ramp-up so, it\u2019s not like we are now at that level at same we are continuing to pursue selling agreements. There are many underway, there will several that will be following the LPL signed agreements. So our objective is to be at the same levels just to where Cole was at its end point, so Cole ultimately had 80,000 financial advisers in its network for Cole 5 \u2013 excuse for Cole 4 we anticipate being ultimately at the same level for Cole 5 so, it\u2019s just a matter of time and getting more selling agreements in space. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : Okay, great. And last question for me just one the deal flow that sort of came through in the second quarter and is under contract or has already closed this quarter excluding Red Lobster can you sort of give us a breakdown of what the off market versus fully marketed was? Lisa Beeson : Those numbers I gave you excluded Red Lobster actually. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : Okay, great. Lisa Beeson : So the numbers that I read out were excluding Red Lobster. Chris Lucas \u2013 Capital One Securities : Sure, thanks appreciate it. David Kay : Thanks Chris. Operator : And next question is Jonathan Pong, Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hi, good morning guys. Just kind of following-up on Chris question there. Can you characterize on the acquisition you have closed on or under contract close on after quarter end outside of Red Lobster what percentage of those are retail investment grade and then what\u2019s the average lease term on those? David Kay : Jonathan, we don\u2019t have the detail on what percentage are investment grade and what percentage are not but we can certainly get back to you with that. Overall, percentages on a pro forma basis including Red Lobster and the sale of centers will be a 46% investment grade so, that not significant different from we were in the past quarter. Percentages have been roughly in line with that considering Red Lobster is such a large piece of non-investment grade obviously considerable portion of the rest of it was to make up for that difference to remain at about 46%. Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Sure, makes sense. And then I think back at NAREIT you had mentioned some of your peers were still interested in some of the Red Lobster assets that you of course have since closed on. Can you update us on whether those discussions are ongoing and if so you know are big are we talking about here? David Kay : You know I mean a part of the reason that Lisa and Brian and our team structured the deal the way that we did in terms of individual master leases of size so, that we would have the opportunity at some point in the future to have flexibility with those in terms of selling them or what have you JV and then et cetera. We have a tremendous amount of reverse enquiry from some of our peers from some companies that are just interested in buying because they know the credit well or they attended Golden Gates bank meeting or have a better understanding maybe of what the future of Red Lobster holds then the general public might not have some of that information. I would say in the time being having just closed yesterday we think that the credit will continue to become more visible to the public and Golden Gate tremendous partner we are very excited to part with Josh and his team and I think that you know on a go forward basis you will see the credit continue to be enhanced by both the synergies by the former management coming in and by the massive amounts of improvements that the stores have that are just not sorting to realize some of the returns. I think that there will be an arbitrage obviously between what we bought it for because we bought all in on peace and what we would potentially sell pieces at I\u2019d say that will continue to evaluate those enquires and offers but we have nothing right now on the board that we would see in monetizing in the next quarter or so. Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks for that that\u2019s helpful and then last question just sort of on financing strategy going forward. Looking into \u201815 as you fill your revolver with acquisitions how are you guys thinking about when it makes sense to come back for long-term financing there on the unsecured side of the equity side is there a margin of safety you\u2019re thinking about whether it\u2019s 25%, 30% capacity remained in revolver how are you thinking about when it make sense to clear that out to preserve flexibility? David Kay : I mean we continue to see pretty low rates and nothing in the very foreseeable future in terms of uptick. There however is always uncertainty and that was part of the reason heading into the summer behind the equity offering. We like our leverage profile prospects at the end of year being in the low to mid sixes, where we have sort of penciled that out. That\u2019s over a turn less and where we had talked to the rating agencies about when we were rated Triple B minus so we feel very confident that we have significantly de-risked the balance sheet. I think in terms of towards the end of the year you\u2019ll see us do a larger bond offering, part of what we offer because of the scale that maybe some of the other just recent general haven\u2019t is liquidity in the bond market. last year it was 2.55 billion when you start to get north of the billion dollars in the bond market it attracted different investor, you\u2019re able to provide a different level of liquidity for them and I think the best attractive from a pricing perspective ultimately for us. So I think you\u2019ll see us towards the end of the year. We may have some rates so that we can lock in some of the treasuries now but we feel pretty confident that yields should stay pretty low. And I\u2019d say that we should have a very-very good following for bond offering that we do and hopefully pricing will be tight because I think that our metrics look more like a mid-triple B company then they do a triple B minus and because again at the liquidity and not being a debut issue or anymore I think that we should have very-very attractive type pricing. Jonathan Pong \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: All right thanks David. David Kay : Thank you Jonathan. Operator : Our next question is Paul Adornato from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Thanks good morning. David Kay : Good morning Paul. Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Hi just a follow up on your last comment are there any metrics in your understanding that the rating agencies want to see improve before you\u2019re eligible for an upgrade or\u2026 David Kay : No, I don\u2019t think so our fixed charge coverage ratio has been one of the biggest movers for us. We\u2019re at north of three times, which is pretty much the highest or at least comparable to any other peers and they are all rated triple B or triple B plus. We\u2019ve seen two companies recently move within our peer group, one to triple B plus that\u2019s at low six times and one to triple B minus although somewhat split rated, two of the three agencies haven\u2019t triple B minus. We\u2019ve the biggest pool of unencumbered assets and the most flexibility for sure biggest amount of \u2013 largest amount of liquidity in terms of our line. I\u2019d say the only thing that the rating agencies can point is to seasoning and I think what we continue to remind them as well as the rest of the market is that our team of acquisition, due diligence, accounting, finance has all been with this company for very long time, just in pieces. The guys who ran Cap Lease and who ran Trust REIT and who ran Cole and who ran ARCP are all still in place. Most of those people have been there seven, eight, 10 years who are running the same jobs. Some of those were CEOs of those companies that are now running huge divisions of ours. Same management, same folks who acquired under-wrote and asset managed all of our assets, and so I think what we need to do and our job is to continue to educate the agencies on why this thing is already seasoned and the rest of the equity markets frankly. This isn\u2019t a put together and we hired 425 new people., these people have been in place running these same properties for a very-very long time and we need to educate them, but educate the rest of the world as well. Operator : The next question is from Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Thank you and good morning. David Kay : Good morning Dan. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : David just wanted to go through the guidance real quick, just so I understand it the pro forma AFFO run rate at year end 2014 you have 1.18 to 1.20. That implies a quarterly run rate of $0.295 to $0.30 that\u2019s not a run rate for the fourth quarter is it, is that what would be call it at the very end of the quarter for the first quarter, assuming for the first quarter of \u201815 assuming nothing new to \u201815, is that right? David Kay : That is correct, other than for Cole Capital that would assume the same estimates for 2015 as we have estimated for 2014. So yes that would be a year end run rate but would assume the same $4.9 billion of assets acquired during 2015 as well as the same $3.1 billion of equity raised in the Cole Capital managed funds. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay so what percentage of\u2026 David Kay : There is no growth in Cole Capital in those numbers at all, it\u2019s just an even split with what this year is. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Well that sounds, that\u2019s kind of my question, so how much of that is Cole Capital of that, $0.295 to $0.30? David Kay : Same estimates of this year where this year\u2019s estimates were a $120 million of EBITDA but on a full year basis it would be $140 million because we only owned Cole Capital this year about 10.5 months. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay alright perfect. So then I guess if I\u2019m looking at the other guidance range you bought that you reiterated the one for full year \u201814, $1.13 to a $1.19 I think the midpoint of that is $1.16 so you\u2019ve done $0.49 year-to-date I guess that would imply about $0.335 in third quarter and fourth quarter to get to that midpoint is that right as well? David Kay : That is roughly yes, the math. And the reason there being is again is that most of the Cole Capital EBITDA will occur with the acquisitions in the capital \u2013 in Cole Capital versus where we were at the first two quarters of the year. It\u2019s a very steep ramp up as you know. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Yes, and so you probably have a benefit from ARCM not being full potentially in to the first part of the fourth quarter as well? David Kay : That\u2019s exactly right because as articulated in that and part of reason why we really wanted to lay that out it\u2019s because you\u2019ll have Red Lobster and Arc Centers being owned for the three months period roughly both at the same time. And that\u2019s why we try to be transparent and give both numbers, give the AFFO run rate so that you\u2019ll see the difference of actually centers coming out as well as the year with both centers and Lobster in at the same period of time. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay got you. David Kay : Just to know one other thing also in the estimate there is no promotes or one-time disposition fees in any of the Cole numbers, either in the AFFO run rate that we gave of the $1.18 to a $1.24 and the $1.13 to $1.19 range where we reconcile to a $1.14. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Right, okay and I guess since we\u2019re almost through July how is the capital raising for the funds looking relative to your guidance? I don\u2019t have that presentation in front of me I can\u2019t remember the number, it might have been 125 if memory serves me correctly. David Kay : It\u2019s our guidance is fairly close I would say that we are slightly behind but because LPL came on last week and we\u2019ll come on this week with the other fund we\u2019re still very confident in $3.1 billion. We\u2019re not making any adjustments to that at all. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Right and both those funds have broken escrow there, right so I mean I think that\u2019s probably pretty\u2026. Lisa Beeson : Yeah long time ago. David Kay : Yes a while back, and we\u2019ve actually brought a significant number of properties in them. Dan Donlan \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay all right thank you for that. Just kind of moving on to the Cole margins. They came in substantially higher than I would anticipate, not that I hadn\u2019t heard a forecast or anything but the 60% NOI margins were fairly high relative to kind of years past and I think obviously the fact there\u2019s a lot of AUM fees in that is helping as not as much capital raising but would you expect that margin to come down kind of in the next couple of quarters as the capital raising accelerates? David Kay : You\u2019re exactly right, we had higher assets, higher acquisitions, lower capital raising and low commissions. So you\u2019re exactly right that\u2019ll start to turn as you start to buy, raise more capital you\u2019ll have higher commissions and then the assets will have a led out. So you\u2019re right, margins will come in. Operator : Our next question \u2013 our final question is from Steve [Manaca], Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, good morning. Quick question on the FFO to AFFO for Cole Capital your other amortization, depreciation is about $24.6 million. What is that \u2013 what assets are you amortizing or depreciating in the Cole Capital balance sheet? David Kay : I\u2019ll let Brain answer that. Brian Block : Yeah, good morning it\u2019s \u2013 relating to the intangible assets we acquired not only the hard assets on the Cole side but we have whole set intangible assets that we were required to amortize as well that are broken in the financial statements notes of our 10-Q. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks and other question is the Cole Capital G&A typically the run rate going for the second-half of the year is about $100 million assuming roughly about $20 million of EBITDA for the first-half. I just want to get a sense that so, going through 2015 when you were talking about Cole Capital on the run rate of a $1.18 to $1.20 for AFFO to reassume the similar ramp in \u201815 for \u201814 with the Cole Capital business? David Kay : Yeah, yes, I would say yes. I could be more level again in \u201815 we\u2019ve assumed no growth at all in that just flat same as this year but yes it should ramp similarly. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you very much. David Kay : Thank you. Thank you everyone for your questions. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today. The second quarter continued strong performance for us and we look forward to providing more details and insights at our upcoming Investor Day.

And good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our call. We're pleased with our third quarter results with AFFO per share increasing by 6.7% to $0.64. As announced in yesterday\u2019s press release, we are reiterating our 2014 AFFO guidance per share of $2.55 to $2.57 so we anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. Paul will provide you with an overview of the earnings numbers. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks John. As usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter. I\u2019ll start by highlighting a few line items in our income statement. Total revenue increased 16.6% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30th was approximately $912 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $52.8 million. This increase was primarily due to our two recent bond offerings, the $350 million tenure notes issued in June and a $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. Interest expense was also impacted this quarter by the reclassification of approximately one month of preferred dividends as interest expense. Because we issued the redemption notice for our outstanding Preferred E Stock before quarter-end, we needed to reclassify the Preferred E Stock as a liability at quarter-end and about one month of preferred dividends as interest expense. This increased interest expense during the quarter by $1.2 million. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.7 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.3 times. General and administrative expenses in the quarter were approximately $11 million, a $5.6 million decrease from a year ago. G&A expenses year-to-date were $35.5 million, a $4.9 million decrease from the first nine months of last year. This decrease in G&A comes from lower acquisition transaction cost, $589,000 year-to-date versus $1.7 million of transaction cost for acquisitions in 2013 as well as lower stock compensation cost. We had a one-time unusual $3.7 million expense during the third quarter of 2013 due to accelerated vesting of our long-term stock compensation. Our projection for G&A for 2014 remains approximately $50 million. Our G&A year-to-date as a percentage of total rental and other revenues remains well at only 5.3% of revenues. And our current projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is approximately $53.5 million. Property expenses were $12.8 million in the quarter. However, this amount includes $8.3 million of property expenses reimbursed by tenants. So the property expenses that we are responsible for were approximately $4.5 million for the quarter. Our projection for 2014 of property expenses that we will be responsible for has increased slightly to approximately $17 million from a prior projection of $16.5 million. And our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 is approximately $19 million. Provisions for impairment includes $495,000 of impairments we recorded on one sold property and three properties held for sale at September 30. Gain on sales were approximately $11 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Excess of redemption value over carrying value preferred shares redeemed refers to the $6 million non-cash redemption charge for the unamortized original issuance costs which were paid when issuing and preferred E shares back in 2006. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.64 for the quarter, this would have been $0.67 per share, but it was reduced by $0.03 due to the redemption charge on the Class E preferred shares. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution and dividends was also $0.64 per share for the quarter. We again, increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to current annualized amount of approximately $2.197 per share. Briefly, turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. As you know in mid-September, we raised $250 million of 12 year bonds priced at a yield of 4.178%. Obviously we are pleased with our continued access to low cost, long-term capital in the bond market. The primary purpose of this offering was to redeem our $220 million of preferred E stock, which had a coupon of 6.75%. So, this transaction resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continue to be rated BAA1, BBB plus have a weighted average maturity of 7.5 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had only a $45 million balance at September 30th. However, $220 million preferred E redemption closed earlier this month. So, the facility has an effective balance of $265 million. We did assume approximately $7 million of additional in place mortgages during the third quarter, but we also repaid $56 million of mortgage principal during the quarter. So, our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter-end decreased to approximately $844 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rise in interest rate that we have is on just $39 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $8 million of mortgage principal payments due in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $120 million in 2015. Our next bond maturity is only $150 million due in November of 2015 and our maturity schedule is well latter thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is less than 3% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter-end was only 5.9 times. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results. John Case : Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overall of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate dependable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy remains consistent with the previous quarter at 98.3% based on the number of properties with 74 properties available for lease out of 4,284 properties. Occupancy has held steady for three consecutive quarters now and is up 20 basis points from one year ago. Occupancy based on square footage and economic occupancy are both 99.1%. Based on what we're seeing today in our schedule rollover, we expect our occupancy to remain fairly stable for the remainder of the year. The third quarter was our most active quarter this year for lease rollover activity in the portfolio with leases expiring on 81 properties. Of these assets, we released 70 to existing tenants, 7 to new tenants and sold 4 properties recapturing a 100% of expiring rents on the properties we released. Our property portfolio management activities speak to the unique and extensive experience we have seen in our business full cycle where leases signed more than 20 years ago are rolling. Over our 45 year operating history, we have successfully executed more than 1,700 lease rollovers. We have a team of 36 professionals, many of whom have been with the company for over a decade working in our property portfolio management department. We believe our expertise in this area is a significant asset to our company. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the third quarter, our properties were leased to 231 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 78% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, while 22% is from non-retail, the largest component being industrial and distribution. This diversification continues to enhance the predictability of our cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, our top 10 and top 20 tenants represented 37.5% and 53.5% of rental revenue respectively. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. There have been no material changes to the composition of tenants in our top 20 since last quarter. None of the top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these non-investment grade rated tenants represents over half of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio no single-tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of rental revenue, so the diversification by tenant remains quite favorable. Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, which is up slightly from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue, which is also up slightly from last quarter. Our 20th largest tenant represents only 1.2% of rental revenue and our 30th largest tenant accounts for just over 0.5% of rental revenue. We also added four new tenants to our portfolio this quarter, further diversifying our tenant base. As far as industries, convenience stores remain our largest industry at 10% of rental revenue and have continued to decline as a percentage of rental revenue for 14 quarters in a row. Our second largest industry is Dollar stores at 9.6%, down from 9.8% last quarter. As many of you know, there has been a lot in the news regarding the top three players in the Dollar store industry. With Dollar Tree and Dollar General competing by Family Dollar. The process remains fluid and one we continue to monitor. Family Dollar shareholders will determine the ultimate outcome here. We would expect the FTC's ruling on any trust concerns associated with the merger to impact the outcome. We remain quite comfortable with our Dollar Store portfolio. We continue to like the deep discount orientation of the Dollar store industry as lower and middle income consumers remain focused on value shopping. Family Dollar and Dollar General remain the dominant players in this industry. Our Family Dollar and Dollar General portfolios have an average lease term of 13 years with the unit level cash flow converge well above the overall average cash flow coverage in our retail portfolio of 2.6 times. A Family Dollar merger with either side should not have a material impact on our operations. Moving onto property type, retail continues to represent our primary source of rental revenue, currently at 78%, with industrial and distribution at 10%; office at 7%; and the remainder evenly divided between light manufacturing and agriculture. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service; non-discretionary; and/or low price point component to their business. Today more than 90% of our retail revenue come from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in all economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. Our weighted average remaining lease term continues to be approximately 10.5 years. Our same-store rents increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date consistent with our expectations for the foreseeable future. The industry is contributing most of our quarterly same-store rent growth for convenient stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade tenants. Again, we define an investment grade rated company as having an investment grade rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is up from 40% one year ago. We continue to generate solid rental growth from these investment grade tenants. Nearly 70% of our investment grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues have rental rate increases in them which average approximately 1.4% annually, consistent with our historical portfolio rental growth rate. Overall, investment grade rental growth is about 1%. In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. On average, our rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6 times on four wall basis. Moving on to acquisitions. We continue to see a very high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced over 7 billion in acquisition opportunities and year-to-date nearly 21 billion, making this already our second most active year ever for sourced transactions. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions and we're seeing some very aggressive pricing in transaction structures in the market today. We continue to remain selective and disciplined in our investment strategy, investing at attractive risk adjusted returns and spreads for our shareholders. During the quarter, we completed $182 million in property level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.4%, bringing us to $1.24 billion in acquisitions for the year at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1%. We're pleased with the yields, returns and spreads we're achieving. Given our low cost of capital, we continue to be able to invest at accretive levels. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital continue to be well above our historical averages. So we are investing at spreads that are nearly a 100 basis points wider than our long-term average. We anticipate closing approximately $1.4 billion in acquisitions this year, making 2014 our second most acquisitive year ever in our company\u2019s history. Given the current environment, we\u2019re establishing initial acquisitions guidance for 2015 of $500 million to $800 million. As you know, it\u2019s notoriously difficult to predict future acquisitions activity. Volumes can be lumpy and can change significantly from quarter-to-quarter. However, we continue to see a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. Given the backdrop of this acquisitions environment, we are increasing our asset sales this year from $75 million to approximately $100 million to take advantage of a more aggressive market for buying; this is twice our initial expectation of $50 million at the beginning of the year. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for $33.5 million which brings us to 28 properties sold to-date for $53 million. These are our non-strategic assets being sold at attractive pricing. Let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss in more detail our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2014, we invested $182 million in 49 properties located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.2 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates or cash not GAAP which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 53% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial and distribution. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are home improvement and drugstores. Year-to-date 2014, we invested $1.24 billion in $439 properties located in 42 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with the weighted average lease term of 12.6 years. Of the total amount, approximately $329 million was invested in non-investment grade retail properties. On a revenue basis, 70% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, 7% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing and 7% are from office. These assets are leased to 51 different tenants in 27 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented are Dollar stores, home improvements and drugstores. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $7 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately $21 billion in potential transaction opportunities, which as we mentioned last quarter would put us on pace to make 2014 the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, 75% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 25% or $5 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 48% for the quarter. Of the $182 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, approximately 48% were one-off transactions. 69% of the transactions closed in the third quarter were relationship driven. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 6% of the deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 45 year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remained tight in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from mid 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from low-to-mid 6% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, we had a very active quarter for dispositions and have increased our dispositions guidance to approximately $100 million to take advantage of the propitious cap rate environment. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for $33.5 million at an unlevered IRR of just over 12%. This brings us to 28 properties sold year-to-date for $53.3 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 11% and a net cap rate of 8.1% on the leased properties sold. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 224 basis points in the third quarter and a 190 basis points year-to-date, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. We are continuing to make investments above our historic spreads, whilst improving our real estate portfolio, tenant quality, credit quality and overall diversification. In conclusion, the third quarter investments remained healthy at $182 million. Year-to-date we have invested $1.24 billion, while sourcing approximately $21 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above historical level as a tight cap rate environment in the third quarter was more than offset by improving cost of capital. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. We remained confident of reaching our updated investment and disposition goals of approximately $1.4 billion and approximately $100 million respectively for 2014. With that, I would like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks Sumit. Regarding our capital raising activities, as Paul mentioned, we've been quite active in the capital markets year-to-date. We have raised over $1.2 billion in permanent and long-term capital to finance our business. The majority being equity with the remainder being 10 and 12 year unsecured bonds. So, our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape with two-thirds equity and one-third debt and that debt being predominantly long-term fixed rate. We currently have more than $1.2 billion available on the line to support future acquisitions activity so we continue to have excellent liquidity. Regarding earnings and guidance, we continue to generate healthy per share earnings growth, while maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our third quarter FFO and AFFO per share of $0.64 represented increases of 8.5% and 6.7% respectively from the period one year ago. As mentioned earlier, we are reiterating our 2014 AFFO guidance per share of $2.55 to $2.57, representing earnings growth of about 6% to 7%. We are anticipating another solid year for earnings growth next year and we are initiating 2015 guidance with AFFO per share from $2.66 to $2.71 implying year-over-year growth of approximately 4% to 6% over the midpoint of our 2014 range; and FFO per share of $2.67 to $2.72 which at the midpoint of the range represents an increase of approximately 4% over the midpoint of our 2014 range. Our focus continues to be the payment of reliable monthly dividends that grow over time. During the third quarter, we declared the 77th dividend increase since the company\u2019s listing in 1994. Over this 20-year time period as a publicly traded company, we\u2019ve grown the dividend by a compounded average annual growth rate of 4.6%. We remain committed to the durability and consistent growth of the dividend. Our payout ratio year-to-date has been 85.5% of our AFFO which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. As I am sure many of you saw in our separate press release yesterday, we\u2019re pleased to announce Steve Sterrett, CFO of Simon Property Group as the 8th Member of our Board of Directors and 7th independent Board Member. We welcome Steve to Realty Income and look forward to working with him as a Member of our Board. Steve has spent 26 years at Simon Property Group, the largest real-estate company in the world and has spent the last 14 years as the CFO building a reputation of excellence in the industry. His depth of experience and relevance in our industry will enable him to be a valuable contributor to our Board. Finally to wrap it up, we continue to be pleased with our performance for the year. We\u2019re seeing healthy volumes of acquisition opportunities and we\u2019re on track to have our second most active year for acquisitions in our company\u2019s history. We will remain selective and disciplined with regards to our investment strategy and we'll continue to acquire high quality properties quite accretively with our cost of capital advantage and at attractive risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria - Bank of America : Hi, good afternoon guys. I was just hoping you could give us a little color on the 2015 acquisition guidance, sort of how you came to that number and then background on any spreads or cap rates we should thinking about with regards to that number? And just optically, I know you've kind of stated and stressed that you want to be selective, but just how we should be thinking about that versus the number you put out there for 2014 for the year? John Case : Okay Juan. Let me just spend a moment on acquisitions. We continue to see inactive pipeline of sourced acquisition opportunity, so there is good transaction flow. And as we said, our investment spreads are well above our historical average. But there is also a lot of capital pursuing these opportunities. So, it has been competitive and we remain disciplined and selective with our investment strategy. We're seeing some very aggressive pricing out there among some of our peers and structures, looking at replacement cost; we're seeing assets trade sometimes at 50% above the replacement costs. We\u2019re seeing properties that have rents that are well above market rents trading at aggressive pricing. Then we\u2019re seeing some pretty aggressive structures as well. So we\u2019re seeing for instance and some of the casual dining transactions that have crossed our gas, we\u2019re seeing them get dine at very high coverage ratios, ratios we\u2019re not comfortable with. So we\u2019ve been in this business a long time and I think we have a pretty good idea of what\u2019s going to work and what\u2019s not going to work long-term. Clearly, given our cost of capital, we could do these transactions and initially that would be quite accretive. But when you look at them over the long-term, if they\u2019re not structured and priced properly, you\u2019re going to have some low IRRs and pay the price on the residual, and they could actually the value destructive to our shareholders long-term. Our range for acquisitions for 2015 reflects the environment we\u2019re in today. As you know that environment can change significantly from quarter-to-quarter even month-to-month. I mean if an aggressive buyers out there that all of a sudden slows down or exits the market that could have a material impact on our volume and potentially pricing. So at this point, predicting acquisitions guidance year in advance is always difficult. And we\u2019ve always wanted to be accurate, but not over promise. Historically, we\u2019ve exceeded our initial guidance. If you look at last year, we had $1 billion acquisitions guidance number in October of 2013 for 2014 and we're going to exceed that by about 40%. But as usual, we'll just have to see how that year shapes up next year, but one thing we're not going to do is abandon our investment discipline simply to generate volume. Let me speak to your second point in that spreads and cap rates. Sumit addressed that on the call, but investment grade cap rates we see them get a little tighter. Investment grade is running from the mid 5s to the high 6s and non-investment grade the low 6s all the way up to 8%. As far as spreads go for the year, we've invested spreads of 190 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital. In the third quarter that was 220 basis points. And given our cost of capital today, we're looking at 240 basis points, which are near our all time record spreads. So, they remained quite attractive, but again we've got to look at this business beyond just what it's going to do over the next quarter or next year and we're looking at 10 or 11 year average 13 year or 14 year average lease terms. So, hopefully that answers your question. Juan Sanabria - Bank of America :  Definitely very thorough. Thanks John. And just a quick follow-up if you don't mind. Given how aggressive pricing is, what\u2019s the viewer on dispositions for 2015 is it anything big to the numbers? John Case : We've assumed for 2015 $50 million for now and we're going to watch that pretty closely. We started out this year assuming $50 million and we're going to end up selling $100 million approximately. So, the environment continues to be heated. We're going to go ahead and move some assets, some additional assets off our watch list and take advantage of the strong bid in the market. And I think pricing will improve here in the next few months is my prediction in terms of disposition. So, in the model we have $50 million, but we\u2019re going to watch that pretty closely and if the environment continues to look like it does today, we could see increasing that up to $100 million. Juan Sanabria - Bank of America : Great. Thank you very much for the time. John Case : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender - Wells Fargo : Hi, thanks guys. Sumit you gave cap rate ranges for investment grade and non-investment grade, tentative properties. Were those for the properties you acquired in Q3? Just want to get the range of cap rates you acquired because the blended 7.4 yield I thought was pretty high even though it worth payable to land over 50% investment grade. Sumit Roy : Yes. So, Todd those were the ranges of assets that we saw transact in the market. We didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t believe we bought anything in the low or mid 5% cap rate range. The main reason for the yield that we were able to achieve in the third quarter of a 7.4 was being driven by 18% of the volume was coming from our build-to-suit development funding, as well as some of our forward commitments, which typically has been a much smaller portion of the total acquisition volume, it\u2019s been right around 3%, but in the third quarter that represented closer to 18%. And clearly the mix of investment grade and non-investment grade also played a part in why we were able to achieve the higher yield. Todd Stender - Wells Fargo : That\u2019s helpful. And then just kind of just switching gears, can you share how some of the re-leasing discussions went with tenants? It looks like while you renewed 77 leases, just looking back at the Q2 results, about 50, only 50 leases were coming due in the second half of the year. So, I just want to see, the tenants comfort level in renewing leases ahead of time, it looks like a fair amount of those were maturities not coming due just yet? John Case : That's exactly right. I mean we're always looking for, Todd, managing our rollover and if we can enter into discussions that are advantageous for us and our tenants to re-lease early, we will do that. So, that's why you see that 77 number versus what was scheduled to roll in the quarter. So, we're pleased with that and we'll continue to do that. We're just trying to stay in front of these maturities and our leases and stay in front of them a couple of quarters or longer if we can even. Todd Stender - Wells Fargo : Is there a comfort level with tenants anything that you can, any trends are developing that tenants are able to renew or their willingness to renew it little early, anything there? John Case : Yes. Well, I think in general our tenants are in better shape than they were certainly five years ago; their operations and balance sheets are much stronger; they are more likely to renew. So, we're leasing of the lease rollovers we're executing, 90% are going to the same tenant; 10% to a new tenant. If you look at the history of the company that's been more 70% to the same tenant and 20% to new tenant and then 10% sold. So, those statistics show you that the tenants are more comfortable renewing their leases on the properties and staying in those properties. And it\u2019s a function of a better economic environment, but we also like to think it\u2019s also a function of better underwriting, better tenant selection, site selection on our part having learned from 45 years history in this business. Todd Stender - Wells Fargo : Thanks John. And just was there cost or what was the cost associated with retaining and attracting new tenants; have you guys put out a TI number? John Case : Yes. We are -- that will be in our supplemental. So we spent 125,000 in tenant improvements in the third quarter to re-lease 16.3 million in rental revenue. So that number is de minimis, it usually is dominants; it runs from less than 1% of revenues up to maybe 2%. So, it\u2019s never a material number, but we\u2019re actually including that in our supplement going forward. Todd Stender - Wells Fargo : Great. Thank you. John Case : Thank you, Todd. Operator : Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Sumit, could you just give us, sorry, I apologize if I missed this. But for the acquisitions that you\u2019ve taking for next year, what are the cap rates you\u2019re assuming or the range of cap rates? John Case : We\u2019re assuming 7% for next year. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley : Okay. John Case : Year-to-date we\u2019re at 7.1%. The 7.4%, if we were very pleased with but that\u2019s little higher than what we\u2019re expecting given the current market conditions. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley : And then just given the numbers you quoted on market cap rates between investment grade and non-investment grade, would you expect next year to be a little different in terms of just composition between the two for deals that you do? Sumit Roy : No. I think listen, a lot of it is going to be a function of what's going to be available out there. And I think we've stated this in previous calls as well. We don't target a particular composition with regards to investment grade versus non-investment grade when we're looking at acquisitions. This particular quarter it just turned out where investment grade represented only 53% whereas year-to-date it's closer to 70%. So, we're going to look at opportunities that present themselves. There is a lot of discussion around certain retail asset classes that tend to be more non-investment grade in nature. So it's very difficult to predict as to what the composition of that 500 million to 800 million that John has mentioned is going to turn out to be at the end. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then just maybe on the competition for deals, as you mentioned, it's obviously increased but maybe looking out into '15, maybe just give us your high level thoughts on did you see that competition changing in any way? I know new regulations on the non-traded side don't kick in for a while but could that be a factor as you get towards the year end or could there just be other factors that may make the environment just more competitive or less competitive from your standpoint? John Case : Well, we continue to compete with the other public companies and certainly the non-listed REITs. As you've said, the capital raising has slowed down a little bit there but there is still a lot of equity in those entities. We compete with mortgage REITs and institutional investment managers who are running money for sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, endowments looking for yield. So we bump in to some of them as well. I think that the last few quarters have been some of the most competitive we've seen. And there is certainly some activities out there in the sector that would lead me to believe that the competition could become a little less than tense next year. Again it\u2019s impossible to accurately forecast, but our sense is some of the more aggressive buyers maybe stepping back a bit from the market. So that would be the case. We certainly feel better about the higher-end of our acquisitions range. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then some -- okay, okay. Just last clarification is on the timing of these acquisitions, is there anything different we should assume for next year versus just normal seasonality that we see during the year? John Case : They\u2019re normal, they\u2019re lumpy and they\u2019re really driven by portfolios. And again like last year 2013 we did $1.52 billion in property level acquisitions, the last quarter was a $140 million. This year the first quarter was $650 million and this quarter was a $182 million. You\u2019re going to see that lumpiness because it\u2019s associated with the amount of acquisitions that get done through portfolios. So, I think that will continue. So, we\u2019ll have some heavy quarters and some light quarters like we always have. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks guys. John Case : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Hi. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering if you could comment on the weighted average remaining lease term for the portfolio overall. And I guess let\u2019s say 5 or more years ago I kind of assume that was going to fall in the range of 12 years or longer generally. And I think now it\u2019s around 10.4 years. And just if you can comment around that I guess the change in properties that you guys own now may influence that, but also whether or not you manage to that number and what you'd expect it to be in five or ten years or how that will likely trend? John Case : Yes. Well, I mean when you've got $15 billion in assets and each year passes the lease-term actually declines by year and it's offset partially by acquisitions. And so, if you're acquiring a $1.5 billion at 13 years, you're not going to fully offset the decrease in lease-term on the existing portfolio. On rollovers, you are typically -- if the rollovers go to the same tenant, they are five year lease-terms, if it's a new tenant it's closer to ten years. So, it's a natural evolution for a season that lease company like ourselves to see that lease-term overtime decline. We still focus on average lease-terms of 11, 12, 13, 14 years that\u2019s what we're seeing, that's what we're doing. But you\u2019ve got to remember on the rest of the portfolio, they're getting a bit shorter. And I think one of our strength is to effectively execute lease rollovers. We've executed over 1,700 lease rollovers in our company's history, recapturing nearly a 100% of the expiring rent. And we've got a team of almost 40 professionals dedicated to that effort that they have been with the company; many of them 10 to 20 years. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ve said this before where the rubber meets the road in the business, that\u2019s where you really need to be able to execute and reserve value. And there are not a lot of net lease companies out there that have that expertise and that extensive experience. So, we\u2019re very comfortable with our ability to extend the shorter lease terms and the longer lease terms that eventually need to be addressed as those leases expire. I mean some of the leases, we handled this quarter, we looked at and they were put in place 25 years ago. So again we\u2019d have a very long-term perspective. Does that help Todd? Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Yes, it does. That\u2019s great. Thanks for all that color. And then just a follow-up question on the acquisition guidance for next year. I\u2019m curious, if you are also expecting that the acquisition volume that source is going to be lower or whether you expect that to be relatively constant; you guys are just going to a little bit choosier about what you actually try to close? John Case : It\u2019s continuing to be active in this quarter. We would expect transaction flow in terms of sourced acquisition opportunities to be strong again next year; all indicators were pointing to that it will be. 2013 was a record at 39 billion. This year, we\u2019re already a 21 billion, which is our second best year ever just nine months into the year. So I think that we\u2019ll continue to see that momentum, but again we\u2019ll continue to be selective and disciplined in what we buy. There are a number of discussions going on with respect to sale leasebacks with corporate board; corporate management teams; activist investors. We don't know how many of these are going to end up playing out but it's just one or two or three hit, you could see some very big sourced volumes that could lead to higher acquisition. So that activity in terms of activist investors and corporate boards and management teams scrutinizing their real estate holdings and making sure they\u2019re properly and efficiently managing their real estate is accelerating. So there are more discussions. Unfortunately we're involved in those discussions and that really could impact source opportunities next year there to monetize some of that real estate. Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay, great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. John Case : Okay, Todd. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes the question and answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen, welcome to our call today. We're pleased with our fourth quarter results with AFFO per share increasing by 4.8% to $0.65 and 2014 AFFO per share increasing by 6.6% to $2.57. As announced in yesterday\u2019s press release, we are reiterating our 2015 AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71 as we continue to anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. Paul will provide you with an overview of our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks, John. As usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter and the year starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 14.5% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at December 31 was approximately $920 million. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to $96.5 million in the quarter, as depreciation expenses obviously increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $59.1 million. This increase was primarily due to our two recent bond offerings, the $350 million tenure notes we issued in June and a $250 million 12 year notes issued in September.  On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage of 3.8 times and fixed charge coverage of 3.4 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $15.6 million for the quarter, and $51.1 million for the year, both were decreases from last year, due to lower acquisition transaction costs, as well as lower stock compensation cost. Overall, our total G&A in 2014 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues represented only 5.7% of revenues. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is approximately $55 million or about 5.5% of revenue.  Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $4.2 million for the quarter and $16.8 million for the year. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 is approximately $20 million. Income taxes consist of income tax paid to various states and cities by the company and they were approximately $1.1 million for the quarter and $3.5 million for the year. Provisions for impairment of approximately $2 million during the quarter includes impairments we reported on one sold property and two properties held for sale at December 31. Note that approximately $510,000 of this impairment is recognized in discontinued operations on the income statement. An accounting treatment that is necessary because the property was held for sale at the end of last year when the discount accounting rules changed.  Gain on sales were approximately $25 million in the quarter and $42 million for the year and just a reminder, as always we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.64 for the quarter, a 4.9% increase versus a year ago and $2.58 for the year, a 7.1% increase over 2013. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution and dividends was $0.65 per share for the quarter, a 4.8% increase versus the year ago and came in at $2.57 for the year, a 6.6% increase over 2013. Dividends paid increased 2.1% in 2014 and as previously announced last month we declared a 3% increase to our cash monthly dividend which was paid to shareholders this month. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.268 per share. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. As previously disclosed, we regained our $220 million of preferred e-stock, which had a coupon of $6.75% back in October. Recall it in mid-September, we issued $250 million of 12-year bond prized at a yield of 4.178% to pre-fund this preferred redemption. This transaction overall resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million. Obviously, we are pleased with our continued access to low cost long term capital in the bond market. Our bonds which are all unsecured in fixed rate and continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ have a weighted average maturing of 7.2 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $223 million balance at December 31 and currently we have $382 million of borrowings on the line. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some of the maturity to our outstanding net mortgage that at year end decreased to approximately $836 million. Not including our credit facilities the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is only just $39 million of this mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shaper with only 120 million to mortgages and 150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule as well laddered thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 30% and our preferred stock outstanding is less than 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA at year end was only 5.8 times.  Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background. John Case : Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate a tenable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy increased 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 98.4% based on the number of properties with 70 properties available for lease out of over 4,300 properties in our portfolio. This is the highest our occupancy has been since 2007. Occupancy based on square footage was 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year. Economic occupancy was also 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from both last quarter and year-over-year. 2014 has been one of our most active years every for lease rollover activity with leases expiring on 220 properties. Of these properties, we released 173 to existing tenants and 30 to new tenants, recapturing 99.3% of expiring rents on the properties that were released. In addition, we sold 17 vacant properties during the year. In the fourth quarter we experienced 54 lease rollovers, of these we released 40 to existing tenants and 10 to new tenants recapturing approximately 97% of expiring rents on the properties that were released. Eight vacant properties were sold during the fourth quarter. Our same store rent increased 1.7% during the quarter and 1.5% in 2014. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same store rent growth or convenient stores, health and fitness, and quick service restaurants. We expect same store rent growth to remain at about 1.5% for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the fourth quarter, our properties released 234 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, while 21% is from non-retail properties, the largest component being industrial and distribution. This diversification continues to enhance the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with the service, non-discretionary and/or a low price point component to their business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenues come from businesses with these characteristics, which better position them to successfully operate in all economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. At the end of the fourth quarter, our top 10 and top 20 tenants represented 37% and 53% of rental revenue respectively. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. There were no changes to the composition of our tenants in our top 25 since last quarter. Nine of the top 20 tenants have investment grade credit rating. The rental revenue from these non-investment grade rated tenants represents over half of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of our rental revenue. The diversification by tenant remains favorable.  Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, unchanged from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue, which is also unchanged from last quarter. Convenience stores remain our largest industry at 9.8% of rental revenue, down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our second largest industry is Dollar stores at 9.5%, down 10 basis points from last quarter. As many of you know, the competition between Dollar Tree and Dollar General to purchase Family Dollar recently ended with Family Dollar shareholders approving the merger with Dollar Tree. Family Dollar is our fifth largest tenant at 4.5% of rental revenues. We view this outcome as an incremental positive given the minimal portfolio overlap Family Dollar has with Dollar Tree and there will be no impact on our tenant diversification metrics. The FTC [ph] is currently reviewing the merger, but we remain confident that the performance and long lease duration of our Family Dollar locations should ensure that the divestitures have no impact on our rental revenue. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Again, we define an investment grade rated company that\u2019s having an investment grade rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is up from 40% a year ago. We continue to generate solid rental growth from these investment grade tenants. Nearly 70% of our investment grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues have rental rate increases in them which average approximately 1.4% annually, which is consistent with our historical portfolio of rental growth rate. Overall, investment grade tenant rental growth is about 1%. In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6 times on a four wall basis, and importantly the median is 2.7 times. Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see a very high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced nearly 4 billion in acquisition opportunities and for the year we sourced 24 billion, making this our second most active year ever for sourced transaction. There continues to be a lot of capital to pursuing these transactions and we continue to remain selective in our investment strategy, investing at attractive risk adjusted returns and investment spreads for our shareholders.  During the quarter, we completed $158 million in property level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.1%, bringing us to $1.4 billion in acquisitions for the year at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1% as well. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital continues to be well above our historical average. Today, we are investing at spreads over 250 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital. Given the active environment we\u2019re seeing, we are raising our 2015 acquisitions guidance. We now expect acquisitions volume of $700 million to $1 billion, an increase from our initial acquisitions guidance for the year of $500 million to $800 million.  As expected, we had a very active quarter for dispositions as we sold 18 properties for $53 million during the fourth quarter. During the year, we sold 46 properties for $107 million more than double our initial expectation of $50 million at the beginning of the year. And we are again reiterating our initial disposition guidance for 2015 of approximately $50 million. Now, let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss in more detail our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested $158 million in 82 properties, approximately $1.9 million per property located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.6 years. As a reminder, our initial cash cap rates or cash not GAAP which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 32% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and 68% of the revenues are from non-investment grade retail tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 13% are from industrial and distribution. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 19 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our quick service restaurants, grocery stores and drugstores. For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 properties which equates to approximately $2.8 million of properties located in 42 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with the weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. Of the total amount, approximately $434 million was invested in non-investment grade retail properties. On a revenue basis, 66% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, 8% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing, and 6% are from office. These assets are leased to 62 different tenants in 32 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are Dollar stores, home improvement and drugstores. Of the 80 independent transactions closed in 2014, only three transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter. For 2014, we have sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. 2014 was the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, 82% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 18% or approximately $5 billion were one-off assets.  Investment grade opportunities represented 49% for the fourth quarter. Of the $158 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, approximately 33% were one-off transactions. 88% of the transactions closed in the fourth quarter were relationship driven. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 6% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our extended operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remained tight in the fourth quarter with investment grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 18 properties for $53.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 5.7% and realized an unlevered IRR of just over 12%. For 2014, we sold 46 properties for $106.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy averaging 211 basis points in the fourth quarter and 195 basis points in 2014, which were significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion, the fourth quarter investments remained solid at $158 million. For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion while sourcing more than $24 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above our historical level as a tight cap rate environment in the fourth quarter was more than offset by improving cost of capital. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters.  We also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 from $500 million to $800 million to $700 million to $1 billion. With that, I would like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks, Sumit. We continue to generate healthy per share earnings growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our fourth quarter FFO and AFFO per share of $0.64 and $0.65 represented increases of 4.9% and 4.8% respectively from a year ago. Our 2014 FFO and AFFO per share of $2.58 and $2.57 represented increases of 7.1% and 6.6% respectively from a year ago. We are reiterating our 2015 FFO per share guidance range of $2.67 to $2.72, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 FFO per share. As mentioned earlier, we are also reiterating our AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 per share figures. Our focus continues to be the payment of reliable monthly dividends that grow over time. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compounded average annual rate of 4.7%.  Our track record was recognized last month with our addition to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index, which measures the performance of companies in the S&P composite 1,500 that have increased their dividend every year for at least 20 consecutive years. We are one of only six REITs included in this index and we remain committed to consistent growth of the dividend. Our payout ratio was 84.5% based on the midpoint of our 2015 AFFO guidance which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. This compares similarly with our 2014 AFFO payout ratio of 85.3%. Finally to wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance for 2014 and we remain quite optimistic for 2015. As reflected in our increased acquisitions guidance, we continue to see healthy volumes of acquisition opportunities but we will remain selective and disciplined with our investment strategy. We remain well positioned to execute on opportunities with just over $1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Additionally, our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders. At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good afternoon guys. Just a question on the strategy with regards to your industrial exposure, how should we be thinking about that either growing or staying the same as a percentage of the pie going forward and what kind of pricing are you seeing for those assets specifically? And is it really just to an investment grade focus on those types of assets? John Case : Yeah. One, we continue to focus on exclusively investment grade industrial. And at the end of the year, last year we had about 14% of our acquisitions came from industrial and distribution. We are still predominantly retail, 86%. We are seeing a bit of cap rate compression in the marketplace and that includes industrial, but we are actively seeking Fortune 1000 tenants with investment grade ratings and mission critical or significant locations with investments at/around replacement cost, at/around long-term - at/around market rents with growth with the long-term lease. So that\u2019s typically the profile of what we are seeing and cap rates for that product range from probably the mid 5s right now to the high 6s. But we will continue to do that, but it will represent a minority of our investment activity. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Should it grow at a piece of a pie or kind of hold steady from the current levels? John Case : Right now it\u2019s holding steady and I think over the near to intermediate term, it will hold steady to grow at slight bit. Juan Sanabria : Okay, thanks. And I just wanted to ask about the increase in your acquisitions guidance, is there anything in particular that drove that? Are you feeling or seeing more portfolio deals or is it more one-off relationship transactions? And just sort of tangential follow-up, I think you noted the fourth quarter had some quick service in restaurant deals. From memory, I think you guys have been a little bit cautious on casual dining restaurants. Any change of tact there may be with the lower oil price or is it just specific to those deals in the fourth quarter? John Case : With regard to QSRs, we\u2019ve been fine now for quite some time. This company started in 1969 with an investment in a Taco Bell and over the last five years we\u2019ve invested $2.2 billion in non-investment grade retail where we are underwriting to four wall cash flow coverages, quality tenants, high traffic quality locations and we\u2019ve never gotten away from that though. We supplemented it with the investment grade strategy but we continue to be very active. The most active we\u2019ve been in our history over the last five years in buying on investment grade retail. So we will continue to do that going forward. As far as acquisitions guidance, the first part of your question, we\u2019re seeing both more one-off and small portfolio sourcing opportunities as well as some larger portfolios. So the driver in our acquisitions guidance change has been more activity, continued brisk sourcing activity, it\u2019s given us more confidence for the year and therefore we raised the midpoint of our acquisitions guidance by $200 million. I\u2019ll add that we did not adjust our AFFO per share estimates because we believe this incremental activity will be more backend loaded and we\u2019ll have more of an impact in 2016 and 2015. Juan Sanabria : Thanks, John. Appreciate the color. John Case : Okay. Thanks, Juan. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi, thanks guys. Just to get a sense of any trend that stick out for the $4 billion of sourced deals that you looked at in Q4, what was the mix of property types and any characteristics may be you can point to and was any of this located overseas maybe what your appetite is for international right now? John Case : Yeah. So virtually all of it was domestic and 90% of it was retail properties. So that will give you a good overview of what the servicing activities look like. Sumit, do you have anything to add on that front? Sumit Roy : No and there was a large portfolio that we saw that had some international assets there as well, but it was a very small piece of the pie, the $4 billion. Todd Stender : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just looking at the sources of capital right now, you tapped this stock purchase plan and DRIP I believe might be in there too for $100 million in the quarter, is this truly a capital source? Should we be thinking about your ability to may be tap a $100 million a quarter if your stock performs well? John Case : Something we implemented about a year and a half ago, the waiver discount program and it\u2019s been very successful for us. We did issue $100 million in the fourth quarter. We also get a little bit of activity on our DRIP as well. Going forward, it\u2019s something that we will opportunistically access. It\u2019s an efficient way for us to raise equity, the cost of that equity is about 1.3% versus a little over 6% for a regular way offering. So it\u2019s cheaper for the company and it allows us to match fund some of our acquisition activity. So we will continue to utilize it where it makes sense in the future, but we also won\u2019t abandon regular or equity offerings. Todd Stender : Is there an authorization for that John or is there a limit of how much you can do or does the board weigh in on how much they want to issue? John Case : Yeah. The board has to authorize it and may have \u2013 and we have authorization of up to 6 million shares which should last us for a while. Todd Stender : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I may have missed this getting on late, but what\u2019s holding it back from increasing your guidance given the $200 million increase in your acquisition guidance? John Case : Yeah. I was just talking to Juan about that. It\u2019s really timely. The incremental acquisitions we believe will close late in latter part of 2015 so they will have an greater impact on our 2016 AFFO and FFO versus 2015. So we felt comfortable leaving our guidance where it is. Todd Stender : Great. Thank you. John Case : Thanks, Todd. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Richard Moore : Hi, good afternoon or may be good morning guys. I\u2019m curious on the line of credit, you guys added $150 million, was that just to pay off mortgages that came due? Is that what that was? Paul Meurer : No, it will be\u2026 Richard Moore : Since the end of the quarter, Paul? Paul Meurer : What\u2019s that? Since the end of the quarter, yeah. It would be primarily used for acquisitions during the first quarter. Richard Moore : Okay. So that was $150 million of additional acquisitions. And do you have additional acquisitions under contract? John Case : Yes, we do. Richard Moore : Okay, great. Thanks. And then I was curious guys, the development and expansion properties I know it\u2019s not terribly many but it look like you delivered nine in the quarter, do I read that right out of the supplemental? And then how do you think about these properties going forward with 2014, it seems that are left to although it get just finished and go away and you don\u2019t have any more of these coming or do you do this periodically? John Case : No, we\u2019d like to maintain a fair amount of activity in that effort. The returns are about a 150 basis points higher in terms of initial yields and what we realize on acquisitions. Currently, we have $45 million in development underway of which we funded just over $12 million of that. About half of that is new development, about half of those assets are redevelopment and expansion of existing properties, but it\u2019s been a very attractive business for us from a return standpoint. And we actually like to see that Rich grow to a couple of $100 million which we think is just fine on a balance sheet of our size, $16 billion in assets. Richard Moore : Okay. Got it. John Case : I\u2019ll just say there will be a consistent theme of the business and continue. Richard Moore : Okay, great. Thank you. So did you deliver $9 million in the quarter, is that right? Did I understand that correctly when I look at the supplemental? John Case : Yeah. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Yeah. Part of it is, we are constantly putting in redevelopment dollars. So at any given time, I think there were 23 assets for the quarter where we invested those $13 million. But in terms of actual delivery, those would only take into account new development and we don\u2019t actually have that stat in front of us. Richard Moore : Okay. So when you talk new development by the way you\u2019re talking built-to-suits I assume? Sumit Roy : That\u2019s exactly right. Richard Moore : Okay. John Case : Yeah. I mean it\u2019s important to note that all of the tenants in place and none of this is speculative development. Richard Moore : Okay. Who are the kinds of tenants typically just out of curiosity? John Case : It ranges from some of our health club tenants, our distribution sector tenants, some general merchandisers and a couple of theaters on the expansion and redevelopment side. Richard Moore : Okay, great. Thank you very much guys. John Case : Thanks, Rich. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Just a quick question on competition, some of your peers have mentioned more or increasing levels of competition from some of the non-traded folks over the last few months. Just wondering if you are seeing any incremental or may be even lower competition at the granular side and may be in the portfolios or may be at the portfolio side in terms of [indiscernible]? John Case : Yeah. We\u2019ve had one major player obviously step back from the market and they played at the granular level as well as on larger portfolio. So we are seeing a bit of an impact from that, but nothing too significant. What we\u2019ve seen is more foreign institutional capital come into the market and really with greater debt we have seen return of the 1031 buyer. So the individual buyers are much more active today for granular assets and more aggressive than they were just a year ago. So some of what we\u2019ve seen go away around the non-traders aren't quite as active as they were a year ago. It\u2019s kind of been offset mostly but not entirely by the return of the 1031 buyer and more foreign institutional money coming into the sector on the higher quality properties. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Thanks. And then just on your watch list, we\u2019ve heard in the retail space in general whether it\u2019s in strips or in malls, there have been some tenants that have been under pressure, some have closed stores. I\u2019m just wondering if your watch list has changed in anyway perhaps by category or any tenant over the last quarter or so? John Case : Not really. When you look at our watch list, you have a pretty healthy portion of that coming from two industries and that\u2019s casual dining and child day care. Our watch list continues to represent about 1.5% of our revenues, it\u2019s not that large. And as we watch those properties, we\u2019ll make decisions whether to sell those leave them on the watch list or return them to the regular portfolio. So we haven\u2019t really seen any changes in the composition. We\u2019ll say that overall the tenant base continues to perform quite well. There is enough economic growth activity out there. The consumers are in better shape. We really by and large have no significant tenant issues right now. So they are as healthy as they\u2019ve been in quite some time. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Thank you. John Case : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. I appreciate the color on the updated acquisition guidance. What this guidance assume for the cash cap rates and investment spreads for the 2015 acquisitions? John Case : Yeah. The initial cash yields are right around 7% and on the investment spreads, we are assuming something consistent with what we did last year, so averaging right around 195 basis points. Nicholas Joseph : Great. Thanks. And then across your portfolio, what do you expect the net impact of lower oil prices to be on your tenants? John Case : Well, we are actually seeing a little of that. We had decent percentage rents in the last year in January and we are seeing the consumer with more disposable income stemming out. While we do own convenience stores, about 9.8% of our rental revenues are from convenience stores. They continue to perform well and inside sales have picked up which is where their margin is, and where they make most of their money. On gasoline sales, their profit is fairly fixed irrespective of price. So the same store portfolio continues to perform well. So we are seeing it, I think we\u2019ll continue to see it as long as these prices hold where little extra money in the packets of consumers will help the Dollar Stores and the C-stores, some of these other areas. Nicholas Joseph : Great. Thanks. John Case : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go next to Cedric Lachance with Green Street Advisors. Cedric Lachance : Thank you. When I look at your cap rates throughout the year in 2014, it remained relatively stable. They\u2019ve always been around give or take 7% on the acquisitions. By contrast, the investment grade tenancy that were acquired in each quarter declined, so from 85% to 30% from the first quarter to last quarter. Would you say that you are purposefully trying to keep your initial yields around 7% and therefore are now willing to do more non-investment grade tenants or is it just a function of what was on the market during the year? John Case : It\u2019s a function of what\u2019s on the market, which assets are offering the best risk adjusted returns. When you look at pricing, it\u2019s not only impacted by investment grade or non-investment grade, it\u2019s also impacted by how much development that we do in the period, what are the average lease terms. So you look at the fourth quarter, you will see lease terms that were longer than they were in the third quarter and that\u2019s reflected in the cap rate. The longer lease terms are going to be at more aggressive cap rates. And then on the development side, it constituted more activity in the third quarter and that\u2019s reflected \u2013 those are higher yields and that\u2019s reflected in our average cap rate for the third quarter. So it\u2019s really hard to sort of extrapolate trends there because the mix shifts each quarter. I think it\u2019s better to look at the long-term trend and while we did see some cap rate compression last year and towards the end of the year, it slowed down, Cedric. So I think that 7% on average, it\u2019s been right around there for the first part of 2015. Cedric Lachance : Okay. So you talked about foreign capital entering the fray or being more interested in the higher quality properties. Have you thought about forming joint ventures with that capital in order to go after some of those lower yielding assets? John Case : We haven\u2019t approached any of them at this point. I think what you are seeing is a lot of capital looking for yield flowing into U.S. some of it\u2019s coming into the sector and there is a fair amount of that capital deployed. So I am not sure that looking \u2013 these are well heeled sovereign wealth funds and other foreign institutions that don\u2019t really need a capital partner. Cedric Lachance : But they may need an operating partner or a partner that may identify acquisitions a lot better than they can, is there a role for you to play? John Case : Yeah. Most of these are working through U.S. based institutional investment managers that run net lease money. So they bought these properties before they sourced and they identify them. So they are not working without a U.S. asset advisor and the fact that it\u2019s not leased. They don\u2019t feel that they need as much of an operating partner as they would if they were in a more actively managed portion of the real estate business. But it\u2019s something that could make sense at some time. Cedric Lachance : Okay. And then just a final question in regards to cost of capital, I think your investment spreads versus where you\u2019ve able to invest historically are certainly at a high point or very close to high point. By contrast I\u2019d say your acquisition guidance for 2015 is fairly conservative. Given that the spread is so wide or at least so wide as it is today, why not be a very aggressive buyer at this point in time and capture the benefit of that spreads in large numbers? John Case : Our consistent theme has been to remain disciplined with regard to our investment strategy. And so we are really pursuing assets that fit our investment strategy. We are talking about 10, 15, 20 year leases and we want assets that are going to perform well over the long run, not necessarily just offering attractive spreads a day, potentially be an issue down the road. So we see transactions getting done that are aggressively structured from a pricing, coverage replacement cost, market rent standpoint and we are not going to chase those transactions because we think there is some risk in downside intermediate term and longer term to those types of transaction.  So we are really approaching it with a long-term view here and we think our investment strategy is something that will serve the company well over the long run. So clearly given our cost of capital advantage relative to the rest of the sector and our availability of capital, we could acquire a lot more than we\u2019re acquiring. But again, we don\u2019t want to deviate from the assets that make the most sense for us and we don\u2019t want to get overly aggressive on the structures either. Cedric Lachance : Okay. Thank you. John Case : Thanks, Cedric. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Todd Lukasik : Hey, good afternoon guys. I just had a question on releasing activity and I\u2019m assuming in the quarter and in the year that, that was all retail assets. I guess it looks like around 2018 you\u2019ll start to see more of the non-retail assets up for renewal. I\u2019m just wondering do you guys had any expectations at that time in terms of what will happen to releasing spread if you expect it to stay the same or may be go up or go down a little bit. John Case : Well, we would expect the leasing spread to be similar to what we have in the existing portfolio maybe a little bit higher. We get to \u2013 in 2018 I think it is our first non-retail property role and I think that as we do our long-term planning, long-term budgeting, we are assuming a recapture rate of right around 100%. We would hope that it would be a little north of that Todd but we will see when we get there. Todd Lukasik : Okay. And then just a question with the re-leasing to the new tenants, is it fair to assume that the majority of those leases that do end up going to new tenants are leases that are up for initial renewal as oppose to subsequent renewal or is that something that spread out across both of those? John Case : It is a little bit weighted towards initial renewals, yeah. Todd Lukasik : Okay. John Case : That\u2019s a good question, yeah. Todd Lukasik : Okay, great. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks. John Case : Okay. Thanks, Todd. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. John Case : Thanks, Taylor, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. We look forward to speaking to you at some of these conferences coming up over the next few months. Have a good afternoon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma'am. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's First Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We're pleased with our first quarter results with AFFO per share increasing by 4.7% to record quarterly amount of $0.67. As announced in yesterday's press release we are reiterating our 2015 AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71 as we continue to anticipate another solid year for earnings growth. We've had an active first four months of the year. We were added to the S&P 500 Index in April becoming the first net lease REIT to join this index. In January we were added to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index as a result of increasing our dividend every year for 20 consecutive years. In addition we raised 379 million in equity capital at an attractive cost to fund our acquisitions activity. Now I will hand it over to Paul to provide an overview of our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks John. As usual, I will comment and provide brief highlights regarding our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.4% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at March 31st was approximately $936 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.5 million. This increase was primarily due to our two recent bond offerings, the $350 million 10 year notes we issued last June and $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. We also recognized a non-cash $1.1 million loss on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.9 times and fix charge coverage at 3.4 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior year. Included in G&A expenses approximately $94,000 in acquisition cost. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.4% and our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 remains the same at approximately $55 million. Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $4 million for the quarter. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remained approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $2.1 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on one sold property, one property classified as held for sale and one property where the building was replaced. Gain on sales were approximately $7.2 million in the quarter and just a reminder as always we do not include property sales gained in our FFO or in our AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.68 for the quarter a 4.6% increase versus a year ago and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.67 per share for the quarter a 4.7% increase versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 2.6% in Q1 and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.274 per share. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. As you know in early April we raised approximately 276 million of new equity capital in conjunction to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very lost by offering shares to the index fund needing to buy stock on that specific day. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continued to be rated BAA1 BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of seven years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $370 million balance at March 31st. After the equity offering and our acquisition activity in April the facility balance today is approximately $400 million. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $785 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $68 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule as well later thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 29% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.7 times. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on the quarter. John Case : Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy base on a number of properties was 98% a 40 basis points decline from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 86 properties held for lease out of nearly 4,400 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.1% a 10 basis points decline from last quarter and a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year. Occupancy based on square footage was 98.7%. We had a number of properties come off lease during the first quarter which impacted primarily our physical occupancy. Our leasing team will continue to address these properties as part of our standard portfolio management process. We continue to expect our occupancy to remain around 98% through 2015. Of the 43 properties we re-leased during the quarter 30 were leased to existing tenants and 13 were leased to new tenants, recapturing 99.2% of expiring rents. Additionally five vacant properties were sold during the quarter. Our same store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth for convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 78% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial and distribution properties at 11%. Our diversification contributes to the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. Today more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristic which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with ecommerce. At the end of the first quarter, our top 20 tenants represented 54% of rental revenue. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. With Circle K's acquisition of the Pantry, two of our top 20 tenants consolidated into one allowing the U.S. government to enter our top 20 at 1.2% of rent. Now 10 of our top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings but rental revenues from these 10 investment grade rated tenants represent 60% of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio no single tenant accounts for more than 5.5% of rental revenue so diversification by tenant remains favorable. Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.5% of rental revenue that actually remains our second largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue. Drugstores and convenience stores are our two largest industries each at 9.6% of rental revenue. Drugstore is about 10 basis points from last quarter while convenience stores are down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our third largest industry is Dollar stores at 9.3% down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you know, Dollar Tree is expected to close its acquisition of Family Dollar later in the second quarter. The FTC has substantially completed its review of the acquisition and identified 340 of the combined 14,000 stores for divestiture. We continued to expect no financial impact on our rental revenue given the minimal portfolio overlap that our Family Dollar locations have with Dollar Tree and the long leased durations of our locations. We continued to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This revenue percentage is up from 46% at the end of 2014 primarily as a result of Couche-Tard's acquisition of the Pantry converting the Pantry our former 15th largest tenant from non-investment grade to investment grade status. However, this percentage should move down a bit to the mid-40s later in the second quarter as a result of Dollar Tree\u2019s pending acquisition of Family Dollar. In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average coverage ratio on our retail properties was 2.6 times on a four wall basis, and importantly the medium is also 2.6 times. Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see a very high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about 9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities and completed 210 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%. So we remain selective in our investment strategy. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions and we continue to see cap rates check down a bit for the higher quality properties we're pursuing. However our investments spreads relative to our cost of capital continue to be quite attractive. Subsequent to the first quarter end we closed an additional 302 million in acquisitions bringing us to a total of 512 million in acquisitions for the first four months of the year. We expect acquisitions volume for 2015 to be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of 700 million to 1 billion given what we\u2019re seeing today. We continue to selectively sell assets and redeploy that capital and to properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the quarter, we sold nine properties for $22.1 million. We continued to anticipate dispositions to be around 50 million for 2015. I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail now. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. We are in the first quarter of 2015, we invested 2010 million in 83 properties, approximately 2.5 million per property located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and the weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates or cash are not GAAP which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 60% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 74% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 26% are from industrial and distribution assets. These assets are leased to 15 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our diversified industrial, quick service restaurants and automotive services. Of the nine independent transactions closed in the first quarter only one transaction was about 50 million. Transaction still continues to remain healthy, resource more than 9 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 46% or approximately 4 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 55% for the first quarter. Of the $210 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, approximately 41% were one-off transactions. 94% of the transactions closed were relationship driven. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 3% of deals sourced and continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46 year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain tight in the first quarter with investment grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold nine properties with 22 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and realized an unlevered internal rate of return of over 12.5%.  Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy averaging 248 basis points in the first quarter which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion, the first quarter investments remained solid at 210 million while sourcing more than 9 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above our historical level as a tight cap rate environment in the first quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We remain selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We continue to seek advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we believe that our acquisitions for 2015 will be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of 700 million to 1 billion. With that I\u2019d like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks Sumit. Our activities continued to result in healthy per share earnings growth which supports the payment of the liable monthly dividends that increase over time. We increased the dividend this quarter by 2.6%. We\u2019ve increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the first quarter was 83.7% which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. Finally to wrap it up, we\u2019re pleased with the results for the quarter and with the investment opportunities we continue to see in the acquisitions market We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions with approximately 1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions, Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question today from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : I am wondering if you expect any impact to your portfolio from Walgreens\u2019 announcement of the 200 store closings. John Case : Nick this is John here. I think that Walgreens is looking at closing 200 underperforming stores while at the same time opening up 200 new stores. Our average lease term with Walgreens is 14 years and we have good performing stores we only have about five coming due in the next three or four years and those are all strong performers. If they were to close one of our stores of course they would be responsible for paying rent through the term of the lease. But we\u2019re not expecting any impact from that at all. We continue to like that business quite a bit as you know. Nick Joseph : And then in terms of the updated guidance at least that acquisitions trending towards the high end, can you update us on the capital plan for the remainder of the year given where the balance sheet is today? John Case : So it will be a function of where we are on acquisitions for the remainder of the year. We have front loaded our equity a fair amount this year as you know partly as a result of the S&P inclusion, so we've raised 379 million in equity to date I would see over the balance of the year we\u2019ll tend to go in the direction of fixed income markets but we\u2019ll look at both equity and debt markets and determine at the appropriate time what makes the most sense for the company from a funding perspective. But given where we are with the balance sheet and what we\u2019ve done year-to-date we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility there. Operator : Our next question will come from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : I was just wondering if you could give us the cap rate, the overall cap rate on the acquisitions I think was 6, 7 if you could break that out between the retail and the industrial assets? John Case : Sure. Sumit, do you want to handle that. Sumit Roy : So on the industrial side, the cap rate was in the low 6 zip code and on the retail side it was in the very low 7, just right above 7 so blended that was 6, 7 on the acquisitions. Vikram Malhotra : And then on the additional assets that you bought subsequent to the quarter, could you just give us some more color as to maybe just high level which sectors or what type of asset they were? John Case : We will release the details on those acquisitions on our second quarter earnings call in July as we typically do. What we can say is that it was principally attributable to a large sale leaseback transaction with an existing tenant. And we're have limited in terms of what we can say about it at this time. We thought it would be helpful to disclose amount in April to put context along with our guidance for the year in terms of acquisitions. Vikram Malhotra : And then just looking at the investment grade exposure overall, I am sure it\u2019s every quarter things can move around. But just high level it seems like that percentage has maybe creeped up the last few quarters. I am just kind of wondering if you just have a sort of governor in some sense I mean you\u2019re close to 48% now, where do you think that number could go over the next year or so. John Case : We\u2019re comfortable at 48%. We don\u2019t have a litmus test or a target. We execute both the non-investment grade and investment grade transactions that are investment strategy within our investment parameters. I will say that as a result of the Dollar Tree acquisition of Family Dollar you will see the investment grade percentage tick down to the mid-40 to probably be around 44% at the end of the quarter because Family Dollar will go from investment grade to non-investment grade. But I think it will remain in the 40s and generally the mid-upper 40s for the remainder of the year. I don\u2019t think it will change substantially. We\u2019re happy with the credit profile of the portfolio and again we\u2019ll execute both the non-investment grade and investment grade opportunities that make sense for us. So that at this point driven by the opportunities we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. Vikram Malhotra : And then just last one obviously I know it\u2019s very small percentage of the portfolio that will come up for re-leasing. But just have you seen any of the tenants or any desire to maybe move down in terms of whenever renewals come-up? John Case : Typically the renewals are for the existing tenants around five years and for new tenants about seven years, that\u2019s held strong for last five, ten years and we\u2019re not really getting much feedback that that\u2019s changing. So we\u2019re not seeing much pressure for shorter lease terms nor we able to extend those lease terms much further into the future than five and seven years. Operator : Our next question will come from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Just a couple of questions here, first, you guys provide maybe an update on where the watch list stand I think last quarter you referenced it maybe 1.5% of revenues, any changes to that, any changes in the composition? John Case : It\u2019s 1.2% of revenues today. It\u2019s about a 150 million in properties. There is a fair amount of casual dining and child daycare on that. This really hasn\u2019t changed substantially since the last quarter. Collin Mings : And then as far as the acquisition is completed year-to-date but at least during the 1Q, can you may be talk about the breakout between rent bumps and what you\u2019re getting for the investment grade versus non-investment grade. John Case : Yes, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what they\u2019ve done historically. On investment grade overall they\u2019re averaging around 1%. On the non-investment grade they are around 1.7% somewhere around there. So not much of the change in terms of rent growth from the acquisitions we did in the first quarter versus what we\u2019ve done over the last few years. Collin Mings : And then maybe just remind us just bigger picture here John, as you think about where assets trading right now relative to replacement cost. I think in the past you\u2019ve highlighted some of the deals that are getting out there. These assets are trading well above replacement cost. I mean how does that look in the current environment and how much of a consideration is that if you\u2019re thinking about the different deals that are coming across your desk. John Case : It\u2019s a significant consideration for us. When we have 9.5 billion of acquisition opportunities like we did in the first quarter yet we execute 210 million, we\u2019re being very selective and a lot of that is driven by structures and pricing that is being given by the markets of these sellers that we\u2019re not willing to match. And that that certainly includes a fair amount of not only rents that are well above market but also replacement cost that are sometimes 150% to 200% pricing of replacement costs 150% to 200%. So there's some pretty aggressive structure in getting done and that\u2019s while you see us continue to be quite selective. Collin Mings : And then just maybe one last one from me, this goes back talking about the deals that are relationship driven I think in the past you\u2019ve suggested maybe 20, 25 basis point greater yield than some of the non-relationships deals. Does that spread still hold true? And then is there any differential between some of the retail and non-retail assets when you think about that maybe 25 basis points advantage you get. John Case : It\u2019s really up to 20 basis points or so and we don\u2019t see a difference between the retail and the industrial assets. It holds true for both classes of assets. Operator : Our next question will come from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : If you were to rank the factors that are contributing to driving cap rate lower I guess across all the property types in that lease other than low interest rates, would your competitors are signing value too? We\u2019re certainly familiar with what\u2019s important in realty incomes portfolio but how are competitors thinking about this space, are they\u2019re looking at the investment grade tenants the lease duration, what\u2019s contributing to that to make net lease a lot prominent than it once was. John Case : Yes, it\u2019s really all over the place but the reason it\u2019s so competitive today Todd because of the function of the yields offered and that\u2019s clearly driven by the interest rates and alterative investments, but we see a lot of players work in this space five years ago coming at and aggressively buying assets. And in some cases I would say that there is not a lot of discipline on some of the acquisitions we see done away from us. So there seems to be an aggressive search for yield. Todd Stender : And how about large deals you\u2019re looking at certainly are comps for your guys, you go back to ARCT in inland, I think you highlighted that the stuff you've already acquired in Q2 as a portfolio. What do the portfolio premiums look like, how does that kind of compare to historically divest and maybe in the last two to three years. John Case : Well, we've seen really an evaporation of the portfolio premium because of resurgence in the 1031 market and lenders lending to that buyer class. So we\u2019ve seen the cap rates on the one-off transactions reach the cap rate that we were seeing on the portfolios and in some cases some asset classes that are even more aggressive. So we're seeing may be the beginning of a reversal where the art is from portfolio to on-off transactions. But that clearly today is non-premium pricing for you know portfolio transactions of several hundred million. Operator : We will take the next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Rich Moore : First thing on other revenue, Paul, that was up and I am curious what I guess that was and then what happens going forward? Paul Meurer : You know it's a typical number I think that it's best to be modeled not a zero as recommended in the past, right, because it's a active portfolio, it's large and you know we actively manage this such that you're going to find income there periodically from easements, proceeds from insurance situations on properties, takings, main takings of may be a small piece of land from an investment, interest income, so it's kind of a mismatch that you're going to have some level of a run rate there. And then the reason was a little bit larger in this particular quarter was a whole back of some funds that we had set aside in an acquisition that was returned to us in the first quarter that the tenant did not need for some tenant improvements they had planned to do in a property that we were acquiring towards the end of last year. So that pops it up a little bit more than usual. Rich Moore : So you did like 3 million last year so if you do you know 3 million to 4 million this year that\u2019s kind of a reasonable number. Paul Meurer : That feels about right, that's correct. And I wouldn\u2019t annualize the number you are looking at here in this first quarter because it did have one unusual $400,000 item in it but otherwise you're going to have some income in that line item every quarter. Rich Moore : And then John, you talked last quarter about, on your development plans about wanting to grow your built-to-suit portfolio and receive a couple of hundred million annually and I think it's a little bit larger this quarter than it was, I mean what if you added you know what are you working and do you still growing it to a fairly substantial size as reality? John Case : Yeah, well you know we're pleased that we've been able to raise it to just under 75 million at the end of the quarter. We continue to look for opportunities to continue to grow that and given the returns we have on those investments and the higher yields. So we're looking at industrial properties and retail sort of a balance of the two and you know good lease terms and cap rates that are in excess of 9% versus closer to 7% high 6% on the straight acquisition side. Rich Moore : So what would be annual? John Case : We would like to see that thing. What's that? Rich Moore : Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you. John Case : No, I was just going to say we would like to continue to grow that -- as the year goes on. Rich Moore : So what kinds of things did you add, do you have any examples of the sorts of projects you are working on? John Case : Yes, in industrial we had a number of expansions with FedEx, you know we had a large retail discount store that\u2019s a ground up development that we started as well. So it's pretty representative of the portfolio. Operator : Our next question will come from Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Dan Donlan : John I was wondering if you could talk a little about Page 16 of the supplemental, just looking at the fix charge coverage ratios that you guys gave there, what percentage of the portfolio, looks like it's 2.6 average EBITDA to rent ratio, what percentage of the portfolio does that represent? John Case : The 2.6? Dan Donlan : Yes sir. John Case : Yes it represents the retail portfolio; we got sales and P&Ls on about 65% of the retail tenant. Most of the balance that we don\u2019t get those on are investment grade tenants. Dan Donlan : That was going to be my next question, what percentage of the non-investment grade do you not get in on, it sounds like it might be basically nothing. John Case : Yes, very, very small. Dan Donlan : And then that is a, that's a four wall coverage, could you may be guesstimate what you think you might be if included you know may be corporate overhead? John Case : Yes I mean it would probably see may be 2 to 3 somewhere in there, for G&A. Dan Donlan : And then I guess for Paul, just kind of making sure the, just so I understand the balance sheet, is the CIP that you guys have, is that, is that roll through in the other assets line item? Paul Meurer : Yes it does. Dan Donlan : And then just kind of curious as to your thoughts on may be doing some 30 year paper, I know you've done it before in the past are you guys open to that, is that market attractive, is it open to you guys? Paul Meurer : It\u2019s certainly open and I would say as a general comment it\u2019s always something of interest longer term, given that we like the match fund longer term with our liabilities versus as you know our long-term asset. So it\u2019s really just a function of how it feels and worth price in a times, it\u2019s very aggressive and is very, very compelling. So it\u2019s something we would always consider. You may recall that last time we did it, it really was the result of a reverse increase from the life company who specifically reached out to us wanting to place third year paper with us and then we surrounded that with some other investors to create a natural trade at that time. But it\u2019s something we will look at each and every time when we consider typically for us long-term fixed rate liability. Dan Donlan : And then just kind of maybe bigger picture I guess John or Sumit, what are you seeing from retailers or companies that have large real-estate, exposure on their books maybe they\u2019re getting pressure from the investors to monetize. Do you see that continue to play out, is there other potential transactions out there that aren't so large that you think you can take down and what\u2019s your appetite for this type of deals on a going forward basis. John Case : Those [spots] continue to multiply and their discussions going on, we can\u2019t go into particulars on those but we would expect to have a couple of opportunities over the next year or two. These things take a long-time. The companies that we\u2019re talking to that we\u2019ve been talking to about this concept for a multiple years but it really seems to be gaining momentum with the activist investors coming in more pressure on some of the boards in management teams to more efficiently utilize their real-estate and potentially monetize it. So the number of discussions we always had these discussions, and say the number of these discussions and the seriousness of these discussions is both my much greater today. So we would expect to execute on something over the next year or two on that front. Dan Donlan : And is there some type of high water mark from percentage of rent perspective that you just don\u2019t want to go above or if you really, really like the deal are you okay with maybe increasing the tenants exposure to 10% of rents, how should we think about that? John Case : I think we would be comfortable for the right tenant, right company, right transaction to go beyond the revenue percentage levels that we are at today. We are at 5.5% at Walgreens and then 9.6% in terms of industry. I could see industry and tenant going beyond that in the near-term and they we try to work our way back down to 10% plus or minus industry revenue exposure and mid single-digits in terms of tenant revenue exposure. So we really like that diversification it\u2019s always been an important element of the story. We\u2019ve never been more diversified than we are today but we would not turn in attractive transaction like that away for a period time to exceed those levels. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Chris Lucas : John, just kind of following up on a couple of earlier questions, really to the development program I guess could you remind us sort of how guys play there and how scalable your infrastructure is if you look to grow this and how you look to expand that program. So what roles are you playing in that process, is it just capital or there are other things that you\u2019re providing here? John Case : It\u2019s a capital, we\u2019re not acting as the developer, we have a relationship with the number of national development companies and we'll fund development or provide a take out. It\u2019s always -- with the signed lease on hand. So there is no speculative development, so it\u2019s really a capital function and I think because of that I think it\u2019s quite scalable. Chris Lucas : So, as it relates to the process development versus acquisitions, is there no more time spent on the development relative to the acquisition? John Case : No, there is more time spent by our team. We got to monitor the development process. We work with outside advisors in terms of monitoring the construction and development and then we have our own team and our own people also involved in that. So there is more time, more effort from the management team from our team here in San Diego on development properties versus acquisitions generally speaking. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. Thanks Elisabeth and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. And we thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard Vice President. Please go ahead. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income Second Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We had a very active second quarter and we are pleased to report excellent results from an acquisitions, capital markets and occupancy standpoint. Additionally we were gratified to be added to the S&P 500 Index in the second quarter. Our AFFO per share growth was 6.3% and a record quarterly amount of $0.68 as announced in yesterday's press release we are increasing our FFO and AFFO per share guidance for 2015 given the Company's positive year-to-date performance and the continued scalability of our business. We believe we are the most efficiently run net lease company with the highest EBITDA margin in the sector today. We are raising our 2015 FFO per share guidance to $2.72 to $2.77 from $2.67 to $2.72. We are raising and tightening the range of our AFFO per share guidance to 2.69 to 2.73 from $2.66 to $2.71. As we continue to anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. Now I will hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul Meurer : Thanks John. As usual, I will provide some brief highlights of our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.1% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as healthy same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at June 30th was approximately $983 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.7 million. This increase was primarily due to our two bond offerings last year the $350 million 10 year notes issued in June and $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. We also recognized a non-cash loss of approximately $900,000 on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 4.0 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.6 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $12.6 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expenses is approximately $192,000 in acquisition cost. And note that we do include these acquisition costs in our calculation to both FFO and AFFO. Year to date our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.3%. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is now approximately $52 million down from our prior estimate of $55 million as we realized lower than expected expense growth given the efficiencies of our business. Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $3.3 million for the quarter. And our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains unchanged at approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on three properties classified as held for sale and two properties classified as held for investment. Gain on sales were approximately $3.7 million in the quarter and just a reminder we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.69 for the quarter, a 7.8% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.68 per share for the quarter, a 6.3% increase versus the year ago. Dividend paid increased 4% in the second quarter and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.28 per share. Now let me briefly turned to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As you know in early April we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in conjunction with our addition to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very low cost by offering shares to the index funds needing to buy our stock on that day. We raised an additional $106 million of equity capital during the quarter through our direct stock purchase plan. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rates and continued to be rated BAA1, BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of 6.7 years. At the end of the quarter we recapped and expanded our unsecured acquisition credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan which is due in 2020 when we have no scheduled unsecured debt maturities. At our current BBB+ BAA1 credit rating the borrowing rate on the revolver is LIBOR plus 90 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 15 basis points which overall represents a 20 basis point reduction for the all in drawn borrowing rate of the previous facility. We very much appreciate the capital commitments from the 21 banks that participated in the syndication of this larger facility for us. Our new $2 billion credit facility had a $430 million balance at June 30th. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $757 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $40 million in mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.9 times. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on the quarter. John Case : Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.2%, a 20 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 81 properties available for lease out of 4,452 properties on our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.2%, and occupancy based on square footage was 98.8%, both up 10 basis points from last quarter. We continue to see good leasing activity and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year. We have leases expire on 80 properties during the quarter and we re-leased 81 properties. 73 of those properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 8 for re-leased to new tenants recapturing 106% of expiring rents. This compares favourably to our historical recapture rate of approximately 98% of expiring rents. Additionally four vacant properties were sold during the quarter. Our same-store rent increased 1.5% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. The industry is contributing the most to our quarterly same-store rent growth for health and fitness and motor vehicle dealerships. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So, we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties leased to both our investment grade and non-investment grade tenants. Approximately 75% of our investments grade leases had rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the second quarter, our properties were leased to 235 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13%. This quarter we reclassified 14 assets previously classified as manufacturing properties representing approximately 2% of rent for our investor category which better reflects these properties\u2019 uses and better clarify our portfolio composition. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants without service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. Today more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with ecommerce. At the end of the second quarter, our top 20 tenants continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. Our largest channel is Walgreens which now accounts for 7.1% of rental revenue, the increase from 5.5% at the end of the last quarter. We continue to like Walgreens\u2019 business their high quality real estate locations and the rent growth we received. We also were confident in the strength of these properties given the visibility we have into their unit level performance. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 4.9% of rental revenue. This quarter we added a new name to our top 20 tenants. Life Time Fitness is now our 13th largest tenant representing 2% of that. During the second quarter, we executed a sale lease back transaction with Life Time Fitness. Life Time Fitness is the tenant we had been meeting with and pursuing for about 10 year now. We followed them through challenging and favourable economic conditions and have been impressed with the performance of their business. We also believe their well located real estate and excellent surrounding demographics and the service orientation of their business make them a great addition to our portfolio. Drug stores remain our largest industry at 10.7% of rental revenue and increased from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter. The drug store industry continues to be an area we favour given the ageing of our population and today's healthcare trends. The convenient store industry is our second largest at 9.4% of rental revenue. Dollar stores are at 9.1% down 20 basis points from last quarter as many of you may know Dollar Tree completed its acquisition of Family Dollar this month subsequent for our second quarter end. As part of the transaction in FTC identifying 330 of the combined 14,000 stores for the divestiture, there was no financial impact on our rental revenue as a result of these divestitures. Pro forma Dollar Tree will represent 4.3% of rental revenue health and fitness is our fourth largest industry at 7.2% of rental revenue a 40 basis points increase from last quarter. Health and fitness is the sector we have been invested in since 1998 and it has performed very well for us we continue to like health and fitness given the favourable demographics supporting this industry. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants remain sound, our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties is 2.6 times on a four wall basis and importantly the median is also 2.6 times. Moving on to acquisitions we had a very active second quarter investing 721 million at an initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and initial average lease term of over 18 years. This is the second highest quarterly volume and property level acquisitions in the Company's history. Our straight line cap rate during the quarter was 7% which reflects the attractive rent growth of the acquisition. For the first half of the year we completed 931 million in acquisitions at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and an initial average lease term of nearly 18 years. Cap rates remain aggressive but stable. However our investment spreads continue to be favorable and remain above their historical norms. We continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter we sourced about 10.5 billion in acquisition opportunities which brings us to 20 billion in sourced opportunities for the year. Given our acquisitions activity to-date and the high volume of opportunities we continue to see we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2015 to approximately 1.25 billion from our previous estimate of 1 billion. We continue to selectively sell non-strategic assets and redeploy that capital into properties that better fit our investment strategies. During the first half of the year we sold 14 properties for $30.5 million. We sold our least non-strategic assets at a cap rate of 7.8%. We continue to expect a minimum of 50 million in dispositions for 2015 and that figure could go up a bit. Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail. Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2015, we invested 721 million in 100 properties located in 33 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 18.2 years. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 49% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 98% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 2% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants and 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drug stores and home improvement. Of the 16 independent transactions closed in the second quarter two transactions were about 50 million. Year to date second quarter 2015 we invested 931 million in 166 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.5 years. On the revenue basis 52% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 92% of the revenues are generated from retail and 8% are from industrial these assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our health and fitness, drug stores and quick service restaurants. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year to date three transactions were about 50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, we resources more than 10 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately 20 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 66% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 34% or approximately 7 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 21% for the year-to-date. Of the $721 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, approximately 5% were one-off transactions. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 7% of deals sourced and continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships. As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain tight in the second quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold five properties for 8 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of over 11.6%. This brings us to 14 properties sold year-to-date for 30.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.3%. Our investments spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 140 basis points in the second quarter, which were around our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less the nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Year-to-date based on the weighted average cost of the long-term capital raised our estimated investment spreads were approximately 200 basis points, notably above our historical average. In conclusion the second quarter investments remain solid at 7.21 million while sourcing more than 10 billion in transactions. Our year-to-date spreads remained about historical levels. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We are also taking advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to dispose assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 to approximately 1.25 billion. With that I'd like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks, Sumit. We are pleased to have taken advantage of the capital market conditions during the first half of the year, that satisfied the majority of our capital needs for acquisitions year-to-date, raising 484 million in equity capital at an average per share price of approximately $50 and issuing a $250 million unsecured term loan at 2.7%. Additionally our new $2 billion revolving credit facility was recapped at a lower rate than our previous revolver and provides for additional financial flexibility as we continue to grow our company. Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high quality assets. We increased the dividends pay this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the second quarter was 83.7% which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. Finally to wrap it up, we continue to maintain excellent momentum in our business. We continue to have very active dialogues regarding potential acquisition opportunities with existing and perspective tenets. We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions with approximately 1.6 billion available on our new $2 billion revolving line of credit. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions, operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Josh Dennerlein : This is actually Josh Dennerlein with Juan Sanabria. Two questions for you guys. First, can you talk about the specific cap rates, rent coverages and annual rent bumps for the Walgreens in Life Time Fitness portfolios? John Case : No, we're not allowed to talk about the specifics of the Walgreens transaction based on non-disclosure agreement, we've executed with them. Josh Dennerlein : Okay. How about Life Time Fitness, any -- could you maybe talk about how you thought about alternative values and residual values for the assets? John Case : Yes I can walk you through Life Time Fitness, obviously it is an industry we like we've been in that industry since 1998. There continues to be a secular shift to healthy lifestyles and we're seeing that in the health and fitness facilities. We see that, with both baby boomers and millennials. And health club usage continues to rise. We saw attractive risk-adjusted returns in this investment. It's well structured with a strong cash flow coverage of 3.2 times and a drop in sales to breakeven on our property to 45%. If you look at the last recession the great recession Life Time same-store revenues fell by just under 3% in 2008 and about 7% in 2009 and then turned positive in subsequent years. So, they performed quite well during some very challenging times. The properties that we own are located in the affluent dense markets with high on average household incomes of 74,000 within a 5 mile radius and in densely populated areas with 217,000 people within a 5 mile radius of our properties. We were able to execute this transaction at about a 20% discount to replacement cost and have a portfolio of properties that are well above the average sales. And EBITDAR levels of the overall cause so we were quite pleased with it. The going in cap rate was 6.5% the straight line cap rate which would reflect the growth and the cash growth in the lease over the lease term was about 8%. So, we were pleased with the growth. As we look at the transaction, we really viewed it more as something and when you ask 10 years of financial and operating history and our credit and research team analogue that quite subtly. And we were convinced that these would continue to be operated as health and fitness clubs. If there had to be a residual use the most likely residual use would be office if they could not be used as health clubs but there are other companies that have operated large health clubs of this size including Club Core, Equinox and Bay Club. So they could be potential tenants as well. So, if we were to convert these to office, they are probably looking at something from $50 to $75 a foot to make these office properties but that's not really having looked at it. Operator : We will go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nick Joseph : I'm curious, what the impact is of interest rate volatility in terms of your conversations with potential sellers? John Case : Well it comes up some there's been a fair amount of it and it comes up in discussions where we're talking about pricing and it is something certainly that witnessed a down swing, sellers are trying to put pressure on us and when there's an upswing in the 10 year treasury rate we are certainly are pushing for more yield with regard to our initial cap rates and our overall cap rates. Nick Joseph : You've historically seen a correlation between increased volatility and less acquisition volume or do you think it's more just on the pricing? John Case : No, I mean we've been in an environment that has been volatile with regard to interest rates as you've seen and we've sourced year-to-date $20 billion in acquisition opportunities which puts us on a pace that would break our all time high in terms of sourced acquisition opportunities. Nick Joseph : And then tell us about the decision to issue the five year debt versus doing a longer dated maturity? John Case : Yes, sure we did issue the $250 million of five year unsecured note with our bank growth and it was really done for several reasons. One is we did have a window in our maturity schedule at five years and one of the issues with the banks has been that we typically not kept a lot of outstandings on our revolver. And they were looking for more funded balances, so when we had 21 banks step up and connect to a recast new expanded facility of $2 billion and we wanted to make sure we were meeting some of their demands and some of their desires as well and something they had asked for was a concurrent term loan with a revolver and they were much more comfortable and desirable on a five year term than a 10 year term where we also have a window on our maturities. So, that drove it and very attractive pricing, pricing well inside of where we could have gotten a five-year unsecured note issued in the unsecured debt market. Nick Joseph : Thanks, and then I guess with over 400 on the credit facility and then 150 million coming due later in this year. Should we expect a 10 year offering later? John Case : We're going to look at our capital options as the markets evolve over the remainder of the year and determine how we want to fund the business based on what the market share was. So it could range from all types of capital now from 10 year longer to equity as well. Operator : We'll go next to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Just to clarify on Life Time. Can you may be I guess you looked at some of the other tranches or portfolios or with tranches within Life Time that were being marketed. What were maybe some of the differences it sounds like maybe the term of the rent pumps were different from something that one of your peers took about? John Case : The portfolios were all very similar. And we were obviously pleased with the portfolio we received and were able to work with Life Time in structuring that portfolio and it met our demands and it also met the desires of the Life Time team. Vikram Malhotra : But your rent bumps were higher or your term was different from the other portfolios? John Case : Our lease term was 25 years which I think is different than the lease term on some of the other portfolios I believe. Vikram Malhotra : Okay and then as you look at these couple of portfolio you've done. Is there -- are they under a master lease and can you -- do you have the ability to if you choose to maybe sell a few of the assets? John Case : Yes they're under a master lease but we have no intention of selling the assets that are in that portfolio. Vikram Malhotra : Okay and then just maybe last one if you look forward if you look at your guidance obviously it bakes in about 150 million a quarter which is a bit lower but I'm assuming that\u2019s just kind of the baseline acquisitions the relationship driven ones. And so over and above that there could be other portfolios that you may close? John Case : Yes the acquisitions status we have provided for the year assumes our one-off transactions as well as our smaller portfolio transactions and we did not factor in any large sale lease back or very large portfolio transactions? Vikram Malhotra : And just what cap rate are you assuming for the back half of the year? John Case : As we look forward we think cap rates will be in the mid to high 6s for the type of properties we buy. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Tyler Grant with Green Street Advisors. Tyler Grant : You guys have done a good job raising the bar for the net lease sector on real estate related disclosure. With that said it seems that a good next progression should be to improve disclosure related to the quality of the lease contracts. So for example the percentage of tenants that report unit level financials investment amounts relative to replacement costs or the proportion of assets that are not operating but are paying rents. Can you provide some numbers for lease data points now and maybe for similar data points that you believe are worth mentioning. And then also going forward what's the feasibility of providing this type of data systematically within your quarterly financials? John Case : Yes I mean we will continue as we have done this quarter to add data to our supplemental investor package which we agree with you is the most robust in the industry. A lot of our competitors are not providing anywhere near the level of information we are. And we certainly have issues with some of the information that present competitive issues for us to consider. So we're going to see where the industry involves to our and continue to add and tweak our supplemental package. But in terms of just a full dump of everything we're not anticipating doing that for competitive reasons at this point. Tyler Grant : And I guess if I look at it even if we got aggregate numbers. So for example the converge ratio of 2.6 that you guys disclosed. What percentage of your retailers are actually providing you with financials so that you can arrive at that figure? John Case : Yes so just under 70% of our retail tenants providers\u2019 sales and profit and loss information. So that should give you an idea of what that number is. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Dan Donlan : John or Sumit we're just curious the releasing spread of 107 was up nicely versus the first quarter and seems to be quite higher than I would have expected given kind of the nature of your business. Can you maybe talk about why the leasing spread was so positive was it any one tenant or any detail would be helpful? John Case : Yes I mean the primary reason why as we were able to retain 90% of our existing tenants this quarter. And those tenants typically have options to renew those options have a fairly significant cost to them. So they exercise the options to renew and that resulted in the high rent relative to the expiring rent. Dan Donlan : Okay. And then just... John Case : Go ahead. Dan Donlan : Yes, and I was asking another question, the -- as far as your tenants that are not rated, could you maybe give us a percentage of those tenants that are not rated because they don't have any debt in other words they would be investment grades but they just don't have any debt or do you have any metrics on that? John Case : Well, we do and I don't have them off the top of my head there are a number of tenants you're talking about the 52% non-investment grade rated tenants? Dan Donlan : Right. John Case : I would say that you can get that figure but we don't have that right now. I mean some are rated and are below investment grade and some are simply not rated and have excellent balance sheets but are just not rated. Dan Donlan : Okay. And then I guess a question for Paul. The $20 million of un-reimbursed property expenses seems fairly high, given that you've only recognized, I think 7.3 million year-to-date. So just kind of curious, is there some type of seasonality in this number or are you just being conservative or is there some type of onetime items you're expecting? Paul Meurer : And that's good observation. So, the property expenses have come in a little bit lower maintenance utilities, bad debt expense is lower kind of across the board. There is a little bit of seasonality, typically the second half of the year, un-reimbursed property expenses are higher. But to be candid that 20 million is a number we're monitoring and we suspect that, that could be a high estimate we shall see as the year progresses but the second half for the year typically is a little bit higher. Dan Donlan : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just on the G&A, coming down 3 million, you briefly touched on it but, we are just kind of curious, if you could give us a little bit more detail, I mean, did you just not need to hire as many people or kind of what was more detail would be helpful? John Case : I can provide that, we did realize some specific cost savings that we had not anticipated in October, when we originally constructed the G&A budget for this year and those were really in our legal area with insurance. And with our annual report and when you handle that this year and those on a combined basis were seven figure number with regard to savings. We also saw that we are more appropriately staffed for our activity than we had expected to be last October. Over the last four years, we have increased our headcounts here by 50% and we have added a lot of skilled excellent staff members, team members who have done a great job. So, we're really beginning to realize the efficiencies and the scalability of our business and this was a conscious decision we made several years ago, that build the team, anticipating the growth in the sector and certainly our continued growth. So, that's what you're seeing in that G&A line. And we're certainly pleased to see it. And I would expect our G&A margins to continue to be at this level or even continue to decline. Dan Donlan : And then just last one for Paul more or John. Just kind of curious on the decision to swap out that the term note you really don't have a lot of floating rate debt and I can understand being conservative but why not just have a little bit more floating rate debt at this point in time, what's the thought process there? Paul Meurer : We looked at that, in fact when we were making that decision, we took a look at our peer group inclusive of not only the net-lease sector but our S&P 500 peers and what our floating rate debt exposure looks like in our balance sheet, we compared very favourably, even if we had not swapped out that term loan, we would still be very much in the low-end of that spectrum in terms of exposure to variable rate and floating rate debt in our balance sheet. But ultimately we came to the decision that we wanted to continue to handle the balance sheet as we have historically, which is to lock in longer term generally unsecured fixed rate alternatives there that much fund, our acquisitions and not to be exposed to any rising interest rates going forward and the volatility that that's associated with. But right now other than our credit facility the only exposure we have to variable rate debt is the $15.5 million of mortgage debt exposure. Operator : We'll go next to Todd Lukasik with Morningstar Capital. Todd Lukasik : Just one on the same-store rents, I noticed motor vehicle dealerships were a large contributor up 17% in the quarter, can you just explain how you got such a big jump? Is that just bigger re-leasing spreads upon expiration and renewal or it is something else going on there? John Case : Really it was a function of percentage rents that drove that. Trading with those which is our largest motor vehicle dealership kind of had a particularly strong first half of the year and as we see economy recover, we've seen RV sales grow quite a bit and as a result they took in some percentage rents which derive that number. Todd Lukasik : Is that something that resets the base rents higher then or is that potentially a headwind at some time in future quarters? John Case : No, it doesn't reset the base rent. Todd Lukasik : And then I think historically you guys have had a bit more preserved equity in the capital structure. I'm just wondering if you could go through your thought process on that is it likely to increase again on a go-forward basis there is preferred too expensive at this point relative to other funding sources? John Case : Right now, it is not priced appropriately, it's something we always looked at and we do have about 2% out there in preferred right now. But it's been more efficient and effective for us to use alternative forms and capital given where that market is right now. There's certainly windows in that market where it's attractive and we will consider reassuring but currently that opportunity does not exist. Todd Lukasik : Okay and then just one last one from me. Can you comment on what percentage of the transactions that you evaluate and maybe also the percentage of transactions that you close if the number is different? That are off market as opposed to being marketed to a number of potential buyers or is there everything just so competitive that it is all on market stuff? John Case : Well I mean most of what we did this year has been relationship oriented. It's over 90%, but that doesn't mean we were the only firm to look at the acquisition. That could be a strictly negotiated transaction with the tenant or seller which some have been but it also could mean they accepted our price at a lower price in order to do business with us given the strength of our relationship or they gave us a last look at the pricing on the transaction and an opportunity to top the competitor based on the relationship. The two large sales lease backs that we did this quarter were really during primarily on relationship basis although as we have already discussed, the Life Time was shown doing select few players in this sector. Operator : We're going next to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Just to beat a dead horse on the Life Time deal, I recall you get to pick and choose somewhat when the BJ's wholesale portfolio went to a few buyers, was that the case with this deal, I mean how much more real estate could you have acquired and did you get first look? John Case : There were just a select few firms in this business that got the first look, so we were not the exclusive one. And we did have an opportunity to help construct the portfolio that we ended up with. Todd Stender : And then just as part of the underwriting with the tenant now that's owned by private equity firm, is there an extra margin of safety that you factor in versus say doing a sale-leaseback with an owner that may have a longer term ownership time horizon? John Case : No, we certainly approached the private equity driven transactions with caution for a good reason. Generally there time horizon is shorter in terms of their investment in the business than a corporate tenant driven transaction. However in this case the senior and executive management team are likely be to remain major owners of the company and continue to own it. So, that was a bit unique, but even given that you heard me earlier, Todd, walk through the metrics. We structured this transaction very conservatively so we feel very comfortable with that. But we certainly have the added comfort of knowing that the CEO and the management team are heavily invested in the equity of this company going forward. Todd Stender : Okay, thanks John. And Paul, your line is credit, obviously expanded. It now has a $430 million balance. How do you evaluate how big a balance remains comfortable I guess in your eyes, is it relative to how much availability you have? Is it a percentage of total debt? What kind of measurement steps do you use? Paul Meurer : Overall, we are always going to look at the overall leverage in the organization. And that would be a piece of that leverage, right? So, you can\u2019t just look at it by itself. The nice thing about having a larger facility, as it just generally gives us more flexibility. It allows us to I don\u2019t want to say time to permanent capital markets but at least be available when something is attractive either in equity or in bonds or whatever it might be and having a larger line carrying a little bit more balance still doesn\u2019t jeopardize the liquidity that we like to have available there for our acquisition efforts. So it is just is a net positive for us in terms of our acquisition approach going forward having that liquidity and then having the flexibility to do something when the timing is right relative to the market. But we don\u2019t look at it by itself we look at it as a piece of the raw capital structure and that our primary exposure if you will to variable rate debt. Todd Stender : Okay and then looks like you used the five year term loan at a pretty low coupon to fund some of the Q2 acquisitions. That would done at a cap rate closer to six than say your traditional 7% is it fair to say that we won't be seeing those low cap rates in your acquisitions going forward just because you'll be probably tapping longer term capital? John Case : Yes I think from a cap rate standpoint what we'll be looking at are cap rates for the remainder of the year and the mid to upper 6s. And we really didn\u2019t find that finding acquisition sort of luring the year at more aggressive cap rates at shorter term debt because the cap rates were lower it was really more a function of what I explained earlier and that once that we had the five year window in our maturity schedule and the banks were very supportive about having a balance outstanding through them since our historical utilization of the line of credit had been minimal. Operator : We'll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Rich Moore : And Paul I have a question for you too on the expenses and the tenant reimbursements. We calculate an expense recovery ratio and so we look at the percentage that you get back and that jumped in the quarter because you got a bunch of tenant reimbursements and a lot of extra operating expenses. Is that the right way to think about it because as you do more acquisitions right you're going to assume some of sort of tenant recovery rate that isn\u2019t 100%. And then why do you think that would have jumped in the second quarter? Paul Meurer : Yes I saw that dialogue in your piece and any look at as we have mentioned EBITDA margins for the business I think is a very good way to look at it. Because we think we\u2019re very efficient not only in our G&A but in our property expense side. There is no trend there Rich each lease has its own element of negotiation or if it is an existing lease that we assume relative to the nature of what might be reimbursed or what we may or may not be responsible for. So there is no real trend to look to there in terms of expenses being reimbursed any more or less now or going forward. Other than to say that we expect that to be continue to be a very efficient line item less than 2% of our overall revenues in the portfolio in the property expense area. Rich Moore : And then as you get acquisitions I assume going forward you're not going to get 100% recovery. So we got to think about as we grow your portfolio with acquisitions we got to put some of that as non-recovered expenses as well? John Case : It depends on the type of acquisitions we're doing. The majority of them are all recoverable, so we would not anticipate that percentage 2% moving very much in fact it may come down a bit especially given some of the recent acquisitions we've made. Rich Moore : Then I'm curious when you guys when you did your 200 basis points spread calculation to the cost of assets with the cost of capital. What stock price did you initially said it was a long-term sort of view. But I mean like what roughly was the stock price used to get something like that? John Case : Yes so it was just a shade under $50 it was 49.70. If you look at the V-Lock of our capital for the first six months of year and look at our spreads on our acquisitions year to date based on that number. The spreads are 170 basis points, so 80% we funded 80% of the acquisitions we've done year to date and based on the cost of the actual funding we viewed our spreads to our weighted average cost of capital were 200 basis points which was the number you heard too as I said earlier. Does that answer your question? Rich Moore : Yes it does, yes thank you John. So as I think about yes it does very much thank you as i think going forward then at the current share price they are not substantially below then I mean a little bit below that. But I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt your spreads significantly even the issue equity here? John Case : Our cost of capital overall right now is running just below 5% so it's still attractively priced. So, if we can continue to buy assets at initial spreads 150 to 175 basis points based on our anticipated cap rates for the reminder of the year, those cap rates are still -- those spreads are still comfortably above our historical averages so we\u2019d be pleased with that. Our cost of equity is reasonable at this level. And certainly our debt costs while they have come up a little bit we can still issue 10 year debt right around 4%. Rich Moore : Okay. Good, thanks. And then the last thing I had was on your build to suite or your development pipeline it seems like just I'm assuming it is moving in and out of there because you had fewer projects, I think with higher cost. I mean do you have any sort of summary of what happened in the quarter, I mean, deliveries that kind of thing? John Case : Sure, Sumit can handle that that fluctuates, it's a little higher and we have just under 92 million under development right now. And we have funded it at this point about 25 million of that. Sumit Roy : Yes that's exactly right, John. You have got 65 million of unfunded obligations. Most of the developments that you're seeing Rich is with our FedEx expansions. That continues to be a higher yielding investment for us and those are investments that, it allows us to continue to push out the leases beyond the original exploration when we do an investment for them. Along with FedEx we're also ding investments in AMCs that continues to be a good investment and we do have some build to suit on the retail side that I do not wish to disclose the name at this point but those continue to be a higher yielding form of our investment opportunity set. Rich Moore : Okay and so each quarter, Sumit, what do you think you\u2019d add roughly to the pipeline? Sumit Roy : Each quarter, our run rate has been right around this 90 million unit it has fluctuated from anywhere between 70 units it's been as high as 110. So, about 90 million seems to be rightly would like to be a bit more, given the size of the company, I think you've heard John mention that we would like to see it go as high as 250 but we've not been able to achieve that so the run rate historically has been right around what you see it today. Operator : We will go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James. Collin Mings : I guess my first question just as far as the mix of industrial going forward, I know obviously few large deals impacted the mix here in the second quarter but can you just talk about in the deal pipeline as you are looking at the more industrial deals and has there been any shift to how you think about the investment great mix historically pretty high on the industrial front so just put just more color on that if you could? John Case : Yes, we're really reacting Collin to the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So, we have very high retail numbers year-to-date and for the quarter and we continue to see attractive industrial opportunities but some of those opportunities are very aggressively priced today and we've elected to pass on them. So it's hard to predict the future but we will continue to be active on the industrial front and look at the opportunities that our investment parameters and are priced appropriately for us. And we will certainly continue to look at those investment grade and non-investment grade retail investments as we've done. Collin Mings : Okay and then I guess, kind of switching gears, just as far as I'm casual dining I am just curious here about I mean you guys have brought exposure down I think it was north of 10% a few years ago now down to about 4%, can you just remind us how you are thinking about that sector particularly just in context of going out there looking to sell assets at a 55 cap? John Case : Yes, I mean we continue to look at the QSR and casual dining sector they each separately represent 4% of our revenues and we've always been cautious on casual dining as you know, as you alluded to. For our casual dining investment for us, we want to see an operating concept that has positive trends, we want to see really healthy coverage, coverage beyond what we seen in our overall portfolio, probably three times or greater. We want to see rents that are approximately at market and we want to be add approximately replacement cost on our investments. So, we have a high hurdle there, we have looked at some casual dining investment opportunities and we continue to do that. We haven't seen any on a large scale portfolio basis that meet our parameters for I'd say quality and pricing but we would certainly consider the right type of casual dining transaction. Collin Mings : Okay. Now that's helpful color. Then just real quickly, can you give us any what the watch list is as a percent of revenue, I don't know, if I missed that, and has there been any shift on that front? John Case : Yes it's still at 1.2% which represents about 150 million in properties and what I have said earlier was on the dispositions front, if anything, I mean we had budgeted for 50 million in dispositions, if anything that could check up a bit, and we may sell a little more and that is obviously coming from that watch list, so we prepare it down just a shade, but it's been kind of steady right around 1.2% for the last several quarters. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hi guys it's been a long call, but I've got two questions for you, the first is on your re-leasing spreads, or I guess more specifically, the spreads when you re-leased to a new tenant. If I think back 10-15 years ago, to the Realty Income I grew up with, there was a lot of talk about making sure that the rents on acquired properties on the portfolio were around market and that was one of the considerations for acquisitions. So, I guess it's a little disappointing to see these properties getting re-leased at down 30% to 35%, what exactly is going on with -- it's not a completely insignificant number of properties that it's such a dramatic roll down in rent? John Case : So, if you are looking at the year-to-date, I guess that's in our supplement as where you're getting that information on Page 24, for everyone re-leasing to new tenants, with and without vacancy you're seeing a 30% low down in rents. The issue there is simply, those are -- that's the market, I mean we're also disappointed that it's not higher overall our re-leasing spreads are positive at a -- just under 103%. We've executed more than 1,900 lease rollovers in the Company's history and have a lot of experience at this the majority of the assets that we do re-lease are re-leased at a positive spread and year-to-date 105% of expiring rents to the same tenant. Ross Nussbaum : Where -- maybe the follow-up is if I looked at the entire portfolio today, do you have a sense of what the market-to-market is on the entire portfolio? John Case : With regards with rents? Ross Nussbaum : Yes. John Case : Yes I mean there you can see it that we're roughly at market rents, it's slightly on the entire portfolio just slightly above. So, there's not a very big differencial between our contractual rents and market rents. Ross Nussbaum : Second question I had is on the Walgreens acquisition, I know there's not too much you can say, but if I extrapolate based on the cap rate of the Life Time Fitness deal and the average cap rate which you bought properties, it would suggest that the Walgreens pricing was close to 6 or could it have been below, I guess my question would be why does it makes sense at this point in the cycle when the private market -- the 1031 market is going bananas. Why pay up for the creme de la creme corner Walgreens location -- why is that the transaction that makes sense versus perhaps stepping a little further down the credit curve, or just passing on that opportunity completely? John Case : Yes well, that was a well structured transaction for us and I can't go into details on it, but it looks certainly more favourable than what you see in the 1031 market. And that's an industry and a tenant that we like a lot, you've heard us discuss quite a bit given what's happening in the healthcare industry and with our ageing population and the performance of that company. So, it was an attractive investment and I would say this, we don't do large institutional sale lease back transactions without rental rate growth. [Multiple speakers] In the private market, 1031market it's back as you alluded to and we're seeing quite pricing there at the 5% area. We've even seen some four handles there, so, there is a certainly premium for the one offs that don't necessarily exist for the larger portfolios and then certainly a relationship element to our business with them as well. Operator : We will go next to Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Chris Lucas : John, just a follow-up question on the comments you just about sort of the intensity or the competitiveness of the 1031 market just wondering does it make sense to sort of start ramping up your disposition program to take advantage of some of that arbitrage? John Case : What we are seeing now is we have been in a period for a while where there has been a portfolio premium where people were teaming to get more capital out the door. That pricing has not become less expensive what's happened is the banks have returned to the market for the one off and the smaller portfolios and are lending quite aggressively. So you\u2019ve seen that 1031 market pricing surge and they are fairly equivalent across the board there is very few opportunities as the one that I just described where the arb there is more significant. But we don\u2019t want to sell properties and we don\u2019t want to own long-term and so we're not seeing enough of an arb yet to crank crest back up. But it's something we look at every quarter so that\u2019s a good question. Chris Lucas : And then just for you or for Paul just sitting where we are today with the capital market conditions as they are. If you had to make a decision about raising equity a bit more long-term unsecured debt which -- would you have a preference for either under the current conditions? John Case : We'd be comfortable with either given the strength of the balance sheet and the pricing of both yes we\u2019d be comfortable with either right now. Chris Lucas : And then maybe a little more detailed question on the term facility, Paul is there flexibility or ease that the capital markets present every opportunity to easily prepay that and replace it with some more permanent capital? Paul Meurer : Yes it is fully pre payable without penalty at any time. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. John Case : Thanks Ricky and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you this fall at the various conferences and we hope everyone has a great end to their summer. Thanks again. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Chris Lucas - Capital One Southcoast, Inc. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Realty Income 3Q 2015 Earnings Call. As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income third quarter 2015 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We are pleased with another solid quarter and our position as we move in to the end of the year and the beginning of 2016. Our AFFO per share annual growth during the quarter was 9.4% and a record quarterly amount of $0.70. As announced in yesterday's press release we are raising and tightening the range of our AFFO per share guidance for 2015 from $2.69 to $2.73 to the new range of $2.72 to $2.74 given the company strong year-to-date performance and continued scalability of our business platform. A very high percentage of our revenue continues to flow bottom line. We are also introducing our 2016 AFFO per share guidance of $2.85 to $2.90 representing annual per share growth of 4.4% to 6.2%. I will now hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul Meurer : Thanks John. As usual, I\u2019ll provide a few highlights of our financial statements for the quarter and began with the income statement. Total revenue increased 9.8% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30 was approximately $992 million. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $64 million. This increase was due to the $250 million 12-year notes we issued in September of last year and $250 million term loan issued at the end of last quarter. As well as the lower amortization of mortgage premiums as our outstanding mortgage balance continues to decline. We also did recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $5.2 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a remainder, we enter into an interest rate swap on the new term loan we issued in June with led to the larger non-cash loss this quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 4.2 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.8 times. Both of these metrics are pro forma for the paydown of the credit facility balance with proceeds from our common stock offering earlier this month. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $10.9 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense this quarter is approximately $70,000 in acquisition costs. And reminder that we include these acquisition costs in our calculation to both FFO and AFFO. Year-to-date our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.3%. We estimate this 5% will remain our approximate one rate for G&A for the remainder of the year. As efficiencies in our business model continue to drive improving EBITDA margins. Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $3.4 million for the quarter. Year-to-date our property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.5%. We estimate this 1.5% will remain our approximate one rate the property expenses for the remainder of the year. As these expenses have continue to come in lower this year with lower portfolio vacancy, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer one-time maintenance expenses. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.9 million during the quarter including impairments on one property held for sale, one held for investment, and two sold properties. Gain on sales were approximately $6.2 million in the quarter and just a reminder we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Adjusted Funds from Operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.70 per share for the quarter, a 9.4% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter and now it equates to a current annualized amount of $2.286 per share. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM or at-the-market equity distribution program to offer and sell up to 12 million shares giving us the ability to issue equity capital on an opportunistic basis. Through quarter-end, we had not yet issued any equity through this program. During the quarter, we did raise $152 million of equity capital through our direct stock purchase plan. And earlier this month we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering, we used the proceeds to pay down all outstanding borrowing on our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rates and continued to be rated BAA1, BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years. We again did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter and decreased to approximately to $695 million.  Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $2 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due for the balance of this year and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 28% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA ratio after the equity offering is approximately 5.1 times. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results. John Case : Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 74 properties available for lease out of 4,473 properties on our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.3%, and occupancy based on square footage was 99%, increasing 10 basis points and 20 basis points respectively from last quarter. We continue to see an active leasing environment and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year. We had leases expire on 95 properties during the quarter and we re-leased 97 properties. Additionally, five vacant properties were sold during the quarter, so our vacant property count decreased by seven properties relative to last quarter. 86 properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 11 were re-leased to new tenants, we recaptured 99% of expiring rents without any spending on tenant improvements as it\u2019s typical for us.  We have a lot of experience in the theory of our business. Over the last 20 years we have re-leased or sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases. Our same-store rent increased to 1.1% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date, we expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% this year and next year. As many of you know the timing of our rent increases are irregular and will vary from quarter-to-quarter. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties, approximately 75% of our investment grade releases have been only growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the third quarter our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants operating in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13% of rental revenue. That was really not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenue and drug stores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. This drops from 48% last quarter due to the completion of Dollar Trees acquisition or Family Dollar in July which is now rated BB. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and will be positively impacted by two pending acquisitions of our non-investment grade-rated tenants by investment grade-rated tenants.  The store level performance of our retail tenants remain sound, our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6 times on a four wall basis and the median is also 2.6 times. Moving on to acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $124 million in acquisitions and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. Year to date we had sourced $24 billion in acquisition opportunities and we are on track for our second most active year ever for sourced volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring less than 5% or $1.1 billion of the amount sourced year-to-date. A large portion of the acquisitions completed so for this year occurred earlier than we had originally expected which had a positive impact on our 2015 earnings growth. We continue to expect approximately $1.25 billion in acquisitions volume for 2015. Our initial guidance for 2016 acquisitions is approximately $750 million which possibly reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large-scale transactions.  I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2015 we invested $124 million in 47 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.9 years. On a revenue basis 35% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 52% of the revenues are generated from retail and 48% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 18 different tenants in 13 industries; some of the most significant industry is represented transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 independent transactions in the third quarter and the average investment for property was approximately $2.6 million. Year-to-date 2015 we invested $1.1 billion in 195 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with the weighted average lease term of 16.7 years. On a revenue basis 50% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Also 35 independent transactions closed year-to-date, three transactions were about $50 million. The transactions will continues to remain healthy, we sourced more than $4 billion in the third quarter, year-to-date we\u2019ve sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 62% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 38% or approximately $9 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 36% for the third quarter. Of the $124 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 77% were one-off transactions. We continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over 46-year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remain flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold eight properties for $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.2% and realized an unlevered IRR of 14.2%. This brings us to 22 properties sold year-to-date for approximately 52 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 13%. Our investments spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 212 basis points in the third quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less the nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion the remain confident of reaching our acquisition and disposition goals of approximately 1.25 billion and 65 million respectively for 2015. With that I'd like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks, Sumit. We\u2019ve been active on the capital markets during the year to need our capital needs. Year-to-date we have raised approximately 1.2 billion in equity capital at an average per share price of approximately $48.50. This includes the $517 million equity offering earlier this month at Paul mentioned. Our balance sheet is an excellent shape with plenty of liquidity and financial flexibility. Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high-quality assets. We increase the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We\u2019ve increased out dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in the third quarter was 81.4% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. The rapid our portfolios performing well and we are pleased with where we stand as we ahead into the end of the year and into 2016. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size in the economies of scale of our net lease business. We believe our EBITDA margin is the highest in the sector at 93%. We continue to see high volume of acquisition opportunities and our balance sheet is an outstanding condition of exceptional financial flexibility to fund future growth opportunities. At this time, we would like to open it up for question. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good afternoon guys. Just with your 2015 guidance, what factors are driving the still relatively large delta as we approach the end of the year and apply for the fourth quarter? I was wondering if you can give us a sense for what you expect dollar-wise for a percent in the fourth quarter? John Case : So the large Delta with regard to FFO is a result of swap and the impact that has on FFO and we don\u2019t see that one in AFFO. So it is very difficult to predict forward curve. So you see that it did have a $4 million impact this year it could go down from there so you wanted to make sure we love to range bought out the handle, what we though would be reasonable in terms of movement there. Juan Sanabria : And then any color on percent rent for the fourth quarter? Any expectations you're thinking about? John Case : Over the trailing 12 months we\u2019ve received around 4 million in percentage rent, larger quarters are post quarter typically, fourth quarter won't have a large percentage rent we are not expecting the fourth quarter to have a large percentage rent figure in it. So but again those are irregular and we can give surprise as we were in the second quarter with regard of percentage rents. So go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Just one more quick question on guidance. For 2016 the AFFO is actually higher than FFO. Is that related to swaps again? Because normally it's the inverse, at least if you look at 2015? John Case : Yes, Juan it is related to that and Paul do you elaborate on that? Paul Meurer : Yes, so one piece of that is the swaps and making some assumptions to account for potential non-cash gain or loss there. The other issue is less mortgage premium amortization because our mortgage balance has gone down significantly as you can see over time. And then the third piece would be a little bit less capital expenditures spend that we projected for next year Juan Sanabria : Great. A last more bigger picture question. With the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger, any thoughts on potential store closures, given overlaps that may be required as per the FTC and competition? And then do you expect the management team to maybe look at any real estate monetizations? John Case : Let me take a crack at that one. Obviously we view the merger as a net positive for the company, we believe it's a credit and value enhancing event, Realty Income is likely to improve the credit quality, or definitely will improve the credit quality of the portfolio with an additional 1.8% at least of our rent becoming investment grade rated. S&P affirmed the BBB rating yesterday but did put Walgreens on negative outlook, which is normal in these M&A situations. As you recall, when we bought ARCT we were put on negative outlook while S&P waits to see how you execute and finance the transaction. There will be no impact on our revenue as a result of the impossible divestitures, Walgreens will have the contractual obligation to pay the rent through the term. The pundits in the market over the last two days have estimated that anywhere from zero to 400 stores could be closed, so that's quite a range. But on our Walgreens assets we have an average lease term of 13 years. On our Rite Aid assets we have an average lease term of nine years. And there\u2019s really little property overlap and the two portfolios of the 58 Rite Aid locations we own, 15 of those and within a two-mile radius of a Walgreens store and the average lease term is about eight years. So we feel really good about that and we\u2019re pleased with both companies performance. We\u2019ll take our - depending on acquisitions between now and the end of next year, it will take our exposure - percentage of revenues from Walgreens up to somewhere in the high eights probably, right around 9%. But if we are going to have a tenant, that\u2019s a little higher that we typically like the concentrations to be. But if we\u2019re going to have a tenant there we like that it\u2019s Walgreens. And from a drugstore industry perspective there will be no change and our exposure will still be at around 11%. Juan Sanabria : Okay, thank you very much John. John Case : Okay, thanks, Juan. I appreciate it. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James & Associates. Collin Mings : Hey, good afternoon, guys. John Case : Hey, how are you doing Collin? Collin Mings : First question for me, looks like that the industrial mix picked up a bit during the quarter, obviously relatively low acquisition volume compared to the last few quarters. Can you talk a little bit more about that? It looked like the FedEx exposure ticked up a little bit. John Case : Yes, so as you know, the acquisitions compositions and amounts vary quite a bit quarter- to-quarter. This quarter we had 52% retail and 48% industrial and there was a FedEx in there. So we did check on some additional revenues from FedEx. It's going to fluctuate in the second quarter we had well in excess of 700 million in acquisition and we had quarters where they\u2019ve been close to zero and quarters where they\u2019ve exceeded billion dollars. It\u2019s certainly volatile. But there's really nothing to read into that, when we look at what we\u2019ve done year-to-date 87% has been the retail and we continue to have 79% of our revenues come from retail property. So you are not going to see that number change much. So it's better than average and it\u2019s just relevant here in the third quarter. Collin Mings : Okay. And then I guess you touched on this in those remarks, but given the deceleration in the pipeline, again obviously some larger deals in the second quarter. You still feel pretty good about where your pipeline stands right now and not really any meaningful change in the composition of it? Is that fair? John Case : Yes, that\u2019s very fair. We are going to have our third best year ever in terms of consolidated acquisitions. We are going to have our second best year ever in term of sourced acquisition opportunities. So there is a lot of momentum in the business and I wouldn't characterize this declining momentum might characterize the typical fluctuations quarter-to-quarter and acquisition volume. So again it's very difficult to predict, but we are certainly comfortable with where the business is and the momentum we have. Collin Mings : Okay, and then as far as just on the ATM recognizing it is going to fluctuate depending upon where the stock price is, but what should we think about and how aggressive you might be looking to deal with that in any given quarter? John Case : Yes, I mean we are probably be at 1% or less of our equity markets cap in a quarter, it's not something we're going to used to replace offerings with that it allows us to matching on their acquisitions, be more opportunistic with regard to raising equity and to fund that equity at a much, much lower cost than we do a typical offering, but we will continue to do offerings such as we did post third quarter end. Collin Mings : Okay, that's helpful. And then one last one for me and I'll turn it over. Bigger picture, any changes to the watch list? Or anything else we should be aware of on that front? I know the last couple quarters you've referenced it being pretty stable. Just touch on that real quick. John Case : Yes, it\u2019s pretty stable at 1.1% and not everything on there we\u2019ll end up selling so we are as you heard slipping inside, ramping up our dispositions a bit on what we had originally planned for this year from $50 million to $65 million. We are achieving excellent results on our sales and these are \u2013 some of them have issues associated with them perhaps credit, real estate issues, coverage issues, industry issues and some we are just selling because we have maybe some concentration issues and you don\u2019t want to reduce our concentration levels, but the fact that we are able to sell these year-to-date at a 77 cap rate, 72 cap rate in the third quarter and achieved an IRR unlevered 14%. I think kind of shows you the quality of our portfolio because we are calling off kind of the lower quality assets in general. So I hope that shows the market that we will get a strong portfolio if that's where those properties we want to dispose of the trading. Collin Mings : Okay. On that point, as you referenced that cap rate, is it safe to say as you think about the 2016 guidance that you threw out there, that the dispositions that you look to complete in 2016 would likely be at a similar cap rate to what you've done here in 2015? Paul Meurer : I would think so I mean we budget something little bit more conservative in the high seven and close to 8%, but again it\u2019s going to be a function of the macroeconomic environment and which is more than enough. We are able to \u2013 where interest rates in the macroeconomic environment will be next year. John Case : But I think overall yes I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ll continue to execute the levels we executed at this year. Collin Mings : Great, appreciate the detail. John Case : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : And we will go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nick Joseph : Thanks. The $750 million of acquisitions in 2016, what investment spread is assumed in guidance? Paul Meurer : Yes, we are looking at cap rates that are probably right around what we are achieving now so they are consistent with \u2013 we are assuming there are no material changes in cap rates today. So assume those sort of high sixes area, in terms of spreads Paul you want to hit on that in terms of cost of capital. I think we will continued to be in the area north of our long-term average of 150 basis points or 140 basis points will be in the upper 100s maybe up to 175 basis points. Nick Joseph : Thanks and then just going back the mix between retail and industrial in terms of the acquisitions. Do you expect a similar mix to this year. John Case : Overall, I think that safe to say, again we see for more opportunities on the retail side and retail oriented 79% et cetera earlier about revenues are coming from our retail properties and do not expect that the change materially next year. Nick Joseph : And then finally, can you touch on the initial cash cap rate difference between what you've seen for retail acquisitions and industrial acquisitions this year? John Case : Sumit, do you want to handle that? Sumit Roy : Yes, sure that\u2019s a very difficult question to answer because it definitely depends on the tenant, on the length of the leads on what kind of especially on the retail side on what kind of an asset it is, but if you what think in terms of an investment grade tenant with 15-year, 20-year lease with growth, they trade right around where in the same ZIP Code and it is very difficult to say that one asset class trade that higher price. Now when you obviously translated on a price per square feet basis et cetera industrial we are looking at high quality industrial assets right around that $70, $75 per square feet ZIP Code and in retail once again depending on whether it\u2019s a Walgreen\u2019s or whether it\u2019s a similar investment grade rated lets called Dollar General they are going to have a different range, anywhere between 175 to 225 to 250. Nick Joseph : Thanks that\u2019s helpful. John Case : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Thanks. For Sumit, for the properties acquired in the quarter, can you give us the range what the lease terms were? The average was 10 years, so that's in line with your existing portfolio, but to look at anything on the shorter side? Sumit Roy : Yes, look I think we did have some in the high single-digits and a lot of them bunched around that area from the high single-digits around 13, 14 there were a couple of assets that had not 15-year lease that\u2019s part of the reason why we were able to get a slightly better yield. John Case : You\u2019ll see sometimes in smaller portfolios you might have an average lease yield \u2013 an average lease term Todd 12-years but we are going to have some maybe seven, eight years and there certainly in larger portfolios as well. So we target 10-years and above its typically the natural lease terms range from 10 to 25 I think year-to-date but just under 17 years which is a good number for us. And that continue to focus on that in the long-term range in area to be in. Todd Stender : That's helpful. Was it just the one FedEx you acquired in the quarter? Paul Meurer : Yes, that\u2019s correct Todd Stender : Okay. Can you help us with pricing? As a comp, what the cap rate was? Length of lease? And was this more of a FedEx ground facility? Paul Meurer : It was the FedEx ground that we are not allow to give an specific details on that transaction were subject to confidential reality agreement with FedEx with regard to this specifics and pricing. Todd Stender : Okay, no problem. For Paul, when you look at your cost of equity, certainly you have the overnight markets open to you. You have the ATM in place, although you haven't tapped it. But the direct purchase plan, you've raised a fair amount of equity this year through that. Is there a low-cost, like an ATM-equivalent cost, to raising that amount of equity? Paul Meurer : Yes, its actually our cheapest form of raising equity, closer to 1% average cost there of issuance compare to an ATM with this going to be more like 1.5% to 2% and then your overnight offering there going to be more than that obviously. So it is a product that will remain and utilizing with largely with existing shareholders as well as part of that, their ability to reinvest. But not to any significant amount. As John mentioned we\u2019ll be doing a little bit of that activity in quarter going forward. But any larger equity raises would be dependent upon acquisition volume. Todd Stender : Great, thanks. Lastly, when you look at the Rite Aid properties, if you were to assign a Walgreens cap rate to those going forward, do you guys look at it in terms of how much cap rate compression happened at one fell swoop? John Case : Yes, I mean if you look at the market today, there's about a 50 to 75 basis points differential between where Rite Aid and where Walgreens would trade. So you\u2019ve got yield of anywhere depending on other factors 50 to 75 basis points higher on a Rite Aid and you got a Walgreens. So you expect that to condense based on Walgreens acquisition. Todd Stender : Great, thanks John. John Case : Thank you, Todd. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Rich Moore : Hello, guys, good morning or good afternoon. Did you pull back at all on your acquisition activity due to the softness that we saw in both the debt and equity markets in the third quarter? John Case : No, we didn\u2019t I mean this is just a function of the opportunities we saw that met our investment parameters. And there\u2019s a lot of volatility from quarter-to-quarter and the amount and quality of acquisition opportunities we see. So, we are very pleased with where our own balance sheet is. We got a lot of financial flexibility and significant liquidity. So we did not specifically pull back on the acquisitions activity as a result of some of the volatility we saw on the marketplace. Rich Moore : Okay, great, thanks, John. I'm curious, Paul, on the bonds that you're doing or that you might do. Are these going to get bigger do you think? I think of you guys having $5 billion of debt roughly, that kind of thing, and 10-year laddered maturity. So I'm thinking of larger bond transactions when you do them. The last couple seemed smaller and I'm wondering are you going to carry more on your line of credit? Or are you going to do a bigger bond transaction going forward you think? Paul Meurer : They may get bigger at times of course, as we get larger as a company, you could certainly see larger issuances certainly in the minimum of $250 million to be index eligible something we would always pursue. But at point in time when you go to issue the bond it really depends on what your needs are at that particular time. And if you don't have say $500 million cash needed at that moment, you are not going to issue $500 million bonds that\u2019s happened a few time. And furthermore we haven't quite seen any pricing improvement having a slightly larger offering size. If we would start to understand that you get a little bit better pricing from the debt investors for a larger liquid offering, that something we made and pursue more. John Case : Yes, it\u2019s been an interesting conversation we\u2019ve had and certainly something we\u2019ve studied Rich and that is do you get paid for larger more liquid offerings and certainly a lot of our fixed income investors would prefer those and say that you do. But when you look at the case studies available and we work with our bankers, you don't see a pricing advantage. But that being said larger company as Paul said, doing larger transactions. I think you\u2019ll see our average transactions certainly grow beyond $250 million. And you could see some $0.5 billion bond deals in our future. Rich Moore : Okay, is there a negative to going to market too often? Like if you had to do $1 billion and you did four, one each quarter of $250 million, is that a negative? Paul Meurer : If that was scenario, for example, I think the preference would be to do say, two $500 million rather than four $250 as your fixed income investors would prefer the larger liquidity in each particular issuance, but you can't always project what your needs are going to be in the state of the bond market, the acquisition deal flow timing and that sort of thing of course. Rich Moore : Okay, gotcha. And then I wanted to ask you guys, too, about development if I could. I'm trying to figure out exactly -- when I look at the supplemental -- exactly what's happening with development. If I was on page 13, you have investment in 18 development properties in the quarter. Then when you look on page 15, you have 11 properties currently underway. So I'm assuming seven were delivered in the quarter? Is that correct? John Case : That\u2019s correct. Rich Moore : Okay, and then as you look forward, that remaining investment on page 15, the $58 million, how should we think about the timeframe over which that's going to occur? On top of that, how many more we might add on a quarterly basis, new properties to the list? Sumit Roy : Yes, so as of right now, as it says on page 15 we\u2019ve got $58 million of additional commitments to spend and based on the pipeline the next quarter we don't expect to add any new additional development so that number should remain pretty static of course we are going to stand off of that 50 and so you would expect that to go down. In the event, we do get back with some tenants et cetera with regards to redevelopment et cetera. That\u2019s the only reason why that $58 million will change. Rich Moore : All right, so I should pro rata that $58 million over the next year? Or I guess it's through January, so I guess through the next quarter or so. Sumit Roy : I have the run rate today, yes. Rich Moore : Okay. All right, good and thanks guys. John Case : Thanks Rich. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Dan Donlan : Thank you and good afternoon. John Case : Hi Dan. Dan Donlan : Hey. I was wondering if you guys could touch a little bit on the operating expenses and why that continues to come in below your expectations. Your recovery ratio seems to be fairly high relative to what it has been historically. John Case : Yes, with regard to \u2013 are you telling that with regard to G&A or property or both. Dan Donlan : Frankly both, but just on the property operating expenses, 1.5%, that's a lot lower than what it has been historically. John Case : Yes, so really we realized probably $4 million to $5 million in savings due to fewer defaults this year and lower vacancy I think an improved stronger portfolio it\u2019s reducing our property expense obligations that the company is responsible for. We are also helping to drive that is much quicker resolution of lease rollovers improved our property insurance premiums as well to become a larger company with scale on. On the G&A front, if you go back and kind of our headcount about three years ago we got some pretty significant additions and headcount and year after that they were fairly significant. And we are really positioning the company to handle the growth that we had anticipated and it would continue. Those hiring have fallen each year. We\u2019ve put really skilful people in place I think and having more efficient organizational structure and more efficient systems which allow us to have better G&A margin. So there are some other items related to that, but that's what it's really about. So when we budgeted this year, we budgeted some headcount and did not end up having to add to the company which helped us come in at $2 million to $4 million below where we thought we were going to be on that item. So that's what really is driving the property expenses and G&A expense margins. Dan Donlan : Okay, so you're not handing out jelly of the month club, end-of-year bonuses or anything like that, I guess? John Case : That\u2019s right. Dan Donlan : So just kind of curious, Paul, on the leverage. At 5.1 times on net debt to EBITDA, looking at my numbers, it seems to be the lowest you've been in quite some time. Is there any type of concerted effort on your part, or on the Company's part, to maintain a lower level leverage than you have over the last couple of years? Or is it simply a function of timing? John Case : Its really a function of timing, I am not Paul obviously but I want to talk about this sort of philosophy. We are comfortable with the company two-third equity, one-thirds debt right now we are closer to 70%, 71% equity today little more conservatively capitalizing that saw an attractive opportunity to executed in overnight offering at pricing that would be attractive and highly accretive to our investments and we had a use for the proceeds and we want to precision the balance sheet and a very clean and look and ready to find our anticipated acquisitions going into 2016. So this is not a level, this is not a new level that really represents the change in leverage policy for us Dan just a average of the recent launch equity offering. Dan Donlan : Okay, understood. Is there any type of -- is there any seasonality to 2016's acquisitions? Do you think they'll be more front-end loaded or more back-end loaded or ratably over the year? John Case : Which we could answer the question this year we thought there going to be more back end loaded giving a couple of larger portfolios we will working on and when those tenants want into close and then two changed and all suddenly we went from expecting back end loaded acquisition here that switch to front end loaded acquisition here. Its really difficult to predict, so in model right now we just add that 750 million based on a pro rate structure throughout the year. It wont happen that happen that way. There will be quarters where there\u2019s big numbers and there will be quarters where there small numbers. Unfortunately I'm not smart enough to tell you which quarters are going to be big and which quarter are going to be smaller. Dan Donlan : Okay, fair enough. Then from a portfolio standpoint, has the private letter ruling that's gone away, the IRS or FCC or whoever it is, has said they're going to stay away from this stuff, this op-gov prop-co type of structure that people have done. Have you seen any increase in inbound calls to you guys because of this change in policy from the government? John Case : Yes, we continue to be involved in a number of conversations on that front. We did interpret that as a net positive. Because if you are going to monetize real estate, the IRS has taken that stance, then you sale-leaseback, financing, transactions with companies like ours is the appropriate and best execution we believe. Has there been a sea wave of additional discussions? No, but there is been a slight uptick and we continue to be fairly optimistic that one or two of those will hit and be significant Dan Donlan : Okay, thank you very much, appreciate it. John Case : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Chris Lucas : Good afternoon, guys. John, following up on a couple of the last questions, on the philosophy side, I guess I was wondering if you might be able to remind us what your thoughts are in terms of max category exposure that you would be willing to take and max single tenant exposure that you guys would take? John Case : Sure, Chris. So what we\u2019ve said single tenant is that we\u2019re comfortable in the mid single-digit range, so call that count of up to 7%, under certain circumstances we would be comfortable going above that, but over the long run, we would like to manage that exposure back down because the diversification is highly important to us on our strategy. So you\u2019ll see that we kind of assuming that the Walgreens-Rite Aid transaction closes, we\u2019ll have a tenant that\u2019s in the upper eights in terms of percentage of revenues. So that will be a tenant that we look very, very closely at it in terms of increasing our exposure in fact we would not want to increase that exposure unless there was just something exceptional in terms of an incredibly attractive investment opportunity and then we have discussions with our team here and with our board to see if we even wanted to do that. On the industry side it's always been, kind of in the lower double digits, sort of 10% to 12% range and we want to remain in that area and right now we are in that area but the diversification is something that we think is important in our type of business. Chris Lucas : Okay, and then you talked a little bit before about the spread differential between the Walgreens and the Rite Aid leases. Other than credit and obviously lease term length, but are there lease items that are also included in that price differential? John Case : When you say lease items. Chris Lucas : Go ahead, sorry. John Case : Yes, there is more growth in the Rite Aid leases, and there is the Walgreens leases. So I don\u2019t know that's what you were asking about or not, but there are some minor differences in terms of the two types of leases but not major. Chris Lucas : Okay. Then going back to Dan's question about the private letter ruling arena, have you guys looked at the infrastructure business at all as an opportunity that Realty Income might look at? John Case : We are seeing so many opportunities and the investments that fall with our investment parameters today that's not something we are really looking at. We do have a group and team here that we're constantly looking at what other alternatives in terms of properties may makes sense for us to pursue, but we are really comfortable with where we are right now and we certainly don't have any plans to go into the infrastructure business. Chris Lucas : Okay, and then last question, probably for Paul. On the EBITDA or coverage ratio, can you give us a sense of what percentage revenue is actually included in that calc? Paul Meurer : What percentage of revenue is actually\u2026 Chris Lucas : Yes, I'm assuming it's not 100% of the revenue that you're collecting, right? It's some proportion of the tenants that report that information to you? Paul Meurer : Well, I\u2019m sorry. Yes, I thought you are talking about debt to EBITDA ratio percentage. John Case : Yes, so we get that information from kind of the majority of our retailers. Paul Meurer : That\u2019s just under 70%. John Case : 70%. Yes, and so that\u2019s where that\u2019s coming from, so it\u2019s not 100% and it\u2019s around 70%. Chris Lucas : Great, thank you, guys. John Case : Thank you. End of Q& A Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that does concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to John Case for concluding remarks. John Case : Thanks, Aaron. We appreciate everyone joining today and look forward to seeing most of you in a few weeks at NAREIT. Have a good afternoon and thanks again. Take care. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference everyone. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Vineet Khanna - Capital One Rob Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott Ross Nussbaum - UBS Amit Nihalani - Oppenheimer Tyler Grant - Green Street Advisors Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets Dan Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann Collin Mings - Raymond James Operator : Good day and welcome to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead. Janeen Bedard : Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter 2015 operating results conference call. Discussing our results with me, John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's form 10-K. We will be observing a two question moments the during the question-and-answer portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I would now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We had a solid fourth quarter which concluded an excellent year for our Company with annualized rental revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. AFFO per share during the fourth quarter increased 4.6% to $0.68, and 2015 AFFO per share increased 6.6% to $2.74. As announced in yesterday's Press Release, we are reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90, as we anticipate another attractive year of earnings growth. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional details on our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks, John. I'm going to provide a few highlights, just a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Interest expense decreased in quarter by $7.1 million to $52 million. This decrease was driven by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and almost $200 million of mortgages last year. The decrease was also partially due to the inclusion of preferred dividends that were treated as interest expense in the fourth quarter of last year, when we redeemed our series E deferred equity shares in October of 2014. Another larger impact was from the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $4.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder these mark to market adjustments on our floating to fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there is significant movement in short-term forward curve rates as we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. We do adjust for this noncash gain when computing our cash AFFO earnings. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong, with interest coverage at 4.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 4.0 times. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been and will over ten years. Our G&A in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 5%. We estimate this will remain our approximate run rate for G&A in 2016 as well. Our non reimbursable property expenses in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 1.4%. These expenses came in lower this year due to lower portfolio vacancies, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer onetime expenses. We estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September we established an ATM or at the market equity distribution program. In Q4, we utilized this program to issue approximately 714,000 shares generating net proceeds of $35.8 million. And in October, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds at that time to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. This $2 billion credit facility today has a current balance of $370 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only 170 million in mortgages and 275 million of bonds coming due in 2016. And our maturity schedule was well laddered thereafter. Finally, our debt to EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.1 times, and is only 5.5 times inclusive of preferred equity. Now, let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results. John Case : Thanks, Paul and let me begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.4%, ten basis points higher than last quarter and unchanged from a year ago despite having managed our most active year ever for lease expirations. Additionally, economic occupancy remains strong at 99.2%. During the year we released 253 properties with leases expiring recapturing 101% of expiring rents. As is typical for us we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvements. At the end of the year we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4538 properties in the portfolio. Over the last 20 years, we have re-leased or sold more than 2000 properties with expired leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rents on those properties that were re-leased. Our same store rents increased 1.3% during the quarter and also for the year. We expect annual same store rent growth to remain approximately 1.3% in 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same store rent growth since we started reporting this metric 20 years ago. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type all of which contributes to the stability of the cash flow. At the end of the year are properties were leased to 240 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component, outside of retail, is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the fourth quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.9% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.9% of rental revenue. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in 2016 by Walgreens pending the acquisition of Rite Aid which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. The store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6 times on a four-wall basis, and the median is also 2.6 times. Moving on acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $204 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. In 2015, we sourced approximately $32 billion in acquisition opportunities, which is our second most active year ever for sourced volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 4% from nearly $1.3 billion of the amount sourced and continue to see a strong flow of opportunities in our target property types. We continue to expect to complete approximately $750 million in acquisitions for 2016. As always, this principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large scale transactions. Let may hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we invested $204 million in 104 properties, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.7 years. On a revenue basis, 28% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 89% of the revenues are generated from retail and 11% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 14 independent transactions in the fourth quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $2 million. Year end 2015 we invested $1.26 billion in 286 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.5 years. On a revenue basis, 46% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 21 industries. Of the 49 independent transactions closed during 2015, three transactions were about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $7 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2015 we have sourced nearly $32 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $13 billion were one-off assets. As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the fourth quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 16 properties for $13.9 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.3%. This brings us to 38 properties sold in 2015 for $65.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized and unlevered IRR at 12.1%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 236 basis points in the fourth quarter which were above our historical average spreads. For the year spreads were 183 basis points. In conclusion, given the continued activity in our space we remain confident in reaching our 2016 acquisition target of approximately $750 million and disposition volume between $50 million and $75 million. With that I'd like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks, Sumit. We had a very active year in the capital markets front. We made our finding needs. And 2015 we raised approximately $1.2 billion in equity capital positioning us well as we entered 2016. We are now at the lowest leverage levels we've been at in ten years with debt to total market cap at approximately 25%. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, with plenty of liquidity and financial flexibility. And our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive strong earnings and dividend growth while remaining disciplined with our investment strategy. Last night we announced our 84th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We've increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in 2015 was 82.9% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had a great year and remain optimistic for 2016. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. We remain well positioned to act on high quality acquisitions, given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and cost of capital advantage. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And will go firs to Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time, guys. On the acquisition front could you just comment about how you're feeling about opportunities maybe versus three or six months ago? Are you looking at more portfolio deals given it seems like some of the premiums have gone away and any possibilities to partner with third parties to take down larger deals? John Case : Sure, Juan. First of all, as we look forward on the acquisitions front, we're still seeing a good steady flow of opportunities. And, we're still confident in our $750 million acquisition guidance for this year, and that doesn't include any large scale portfolios or entity level type transactions, but we are constantly scouring the market for opportunities and considering opportunities on a large scale. As far as working with third parties, it is something we would consider. We haven't done that before, but if there were a transaction where perhaps there was a large portfolio where part of the real estate made a lot of sense for us and part of it didn't, we would certainly consider parting with someone who wanted the portion of the real estate that was not consistent with our investment philosophy. Juan Sanabria : Thanks. And just on your cost of capital front is there any have you guys thought about taking of advantage of where your share price is today and hitting the market now ahead of any potential bigger deal flow that may be coming the way in 2016? Or have you think about that? John Case : We're constantly monitoring all of the capital markets, equity, debt, preferred. Right now we only have about $350 million outstanding on our lines so we've got capacity of about $1.7 billion, and there's no need to access the markets unless they were particularly appealing or we had any immediate use for the proceeds. So we're paying attention to what's happening out there, looking at it to, but right now we're comfortable where we are as we speak today. Operator : And will go next to Nick Joseph of Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. I guess, sticking with acquisitions, what are you seeing in terms of pricing of portfolios compared to individual assets? John Case : Individual assets are now priced a bit more aggressively than the portfolios, which is a flip of where we were a couple of years ago. So, we ended up looking at one off acquisitions are probably trading at cap rates of 20 to as much as 50 basis points inside of where midsize portfolios of comparable properties are trading. So there is a little bit of an [ard] there. Michael Bilerman : Hey, John. It's Michael Bilerman. As you think about the other side of using your currency instead of just issuing new equity and raising that capital you certainly can use that equity in any sort of M&A. And I'm just curious how, you're a former banker, are you trying to shake the tree loose out of any of your competitors, just given how high your stock trades and where your multiple is in trying to drive some of that in a public to public M&A and leveraging your currency in that fashion? John Case : We actually are constantly looking at entity level opportunities and given the multiple advantage we have, relative to the sector today, it makes sense for us to consider those opportunities. But, you've got to have to transact you got to have a willing logical seller and a willing logical buyer. So we'll see what may or may happen on that front. But it certainly is something that we're considering. Operator : And we will go next to Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks. Just following up on that the M&A question, just trying to understand, obviously you have the cost of capital if were to just sort of prioritize, what do you do with this cost of capital from here? If we look past at least historically, you've created obviously premiums to the broader REIT group, but that premium has not remained there for a considerable amount of time, so it seems like there's a window and I'm just trying to understand what if you were to prioritize what you do with it? If you could walk us through that it would be helpful. John Case : Yes, well we have typically traded at a premium to the sector. The premium widens during periods of market volatility and uncertainty like we're seeing today. But for the vast majority of our history we've traded at the highest multiple in the sector. As we look at what we may do with the capital advantages from a cost perspective that we have today we're really -- we want to say consistent with our investment strategies. So, on the retail front it's looking for service oriented non-discretionary low price point businesses that have good real estate and rents that makes sense, structures that makes sense. So we think those assets and property types and tenants are better equipped to work through a variety of economic cycles and to compete with e-commerce. And then on the investor side it's high-quality real estate, leased to Fortune 1000 companies with investment grade credit ratings so those are as the buckets we're really focused on. What we don't want to do is go out and wantonly use a lot of capital to buy properties that aren't consistent with the assets that have worked for the Company over the long-term. So, we don't feel pressured to buy inferior assets at times where a multiple advantage is very significant. Vikram Malhotra : Okay and then just if you were say hypothetically there were two portfolios of public portfolio, a public Company, and a larger, private portfolio, somewhat similar return price files, similar properties. How do you think about those two, are there factors that dry you towards one or the other at this point, and would you be considering either of them even if sort of your leverage ticks up they are not leverage neutral? John Case : Well we love to do transactions on a leverage neutral basis, and that's what we've done in the past. Whether it be on the private side or be entity level side. So really what's going to drive which opportunities we pursue is going to be opportunities that result in the most value for the shareholders of our Company. That's how we're going to look at it. We have shown in the past that we can execute public transactions, entity level transactions, or large portfolio transactions. And we do have some leverage capacity today. As you heard that at our lowest leverage levels in the last ten years so we have taken advantage of the capital markets to really strengthen and solidify the balance sheet. So we're very well positioned to grow today where we could take on a bit more leverage than we have today. Our long-term target has been two thirds equity one third debt. As you know we're inside of that today. Operator : And we will go next to RJ Milligan of Baird. RJ Milligan : John, to those comments obviously attractive cost of equity here, but how do you think or Paul, how do you think about your cost of debt here? How has it changed over the past couple months? Do you have any visibility where you could issue long-term debt today? John Case : Ten years -- This is John here. Ten year debt is in the low 4s 4.10%, 4.20%. Spreads have capped out as rates have declined so there hasn't been a big pickup there, Paul, anything? Paul Meurer : The bandwidth, all in, has really stayed in the 4% to 4.2% range in spite of wherever the Treasury or spreads have moved. RJ Milligan : Okay in terms of acquisitions this year, has the spread between investment grade and below investment grade shifted at all given the macro volatility? Or would you say that it is still on a risk adjusted basis more attractive to be going after the investment-grade tenants? John Case : Well I mean we're going to continue -- the spreads really haven't changed the relationship of those spreads. We'll pursue opportunities in both sectors, the ones that meet our investment parameters and make the most sense for us. On the investment-grade side you're seeing some fairly aggressive pricing as Sumit alluded to earlier, around the 5% area on the really higher-quality product. The non-investment grade you're still seeing right around 6% on the higher-quality product. That's not much different than where we were at the end of last year. Cap rates have remained stable, but the ranges on investment-grade, go up to as high as the high six's and on non-investment grade they go up to as high as 8%. The spreads are better today from an investment standpoint given our cost of capital. So, for the year last year, we had investment spreads of 185 basis points on about the $1.3 billion that we acquired. In the fourth quarter, that was more like 236 basis points on the $204 million we acquired. Today, they're running in excess of 250 basis points. So, the margins have never been better than they are now on the acquisitions front. So, we'll be more driven by the opportunities in both the non-investment grade and investment-grade sectors, and we'll react to those versus having sort of a fixed percentage of what we want to buy each. That's consistent with how we've always done it. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Vineet Khanna of Capital One Securities. Vineet Khanna : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So just for those tenants that provide unit level financials is there anything in those results that suggest a change in economic activity, or are there geographies that are doing better than others or anything like that? John Case : No, and we are constantly looking at that. The tenant base is in excellent shape. There's some non-material issues as there always are that are factored into our guidance. And so right now we feel good about the tenant base and their health and condition. Vineet Khanna : Sure. And then as it pertains to acquisitions, are there any industries that you are looking to invest in or not invest in? And then has there been any change in sort of the buyer or seller pools? John Case : No significant changes on the buyer seller pool, and the industries are consistent with the ones that we're in. So if you look at the 47 industries we are in today, with very few exceptions, they're going to align with in those industries. We want to stay away from discretionary industries and businesses. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson of Janney. Rob Stevenson : It looks like in the fourth quarter according to the supplemental that you guys bought 10 Rite-Aids. Are those basically straight down the middle sort of normal ten year plus leases, or have you guys started to look more opportunistically at some of the Rite Aid locations or even Walgreens locations that have five years or less in it to possibly to do a re-tenanting? John Case : That was a sale leaseback transaction we did directly with Rite Aid who is an existing tenant of ours, and it was done before the Walgreens announcement so it worked out very well for us. So those weren't one off transactions. It was just a fortuitous timing I would say in terms of when the transaction was executed. Rob Stevenson : Is there the capability to do anything on an opportunistic basis with short-term lease Rite Aids or even Walgreens where the current owner might be across the Street from something else from one or the other locations, might getting worried that they are going to close down on the location where you guys can buy it at an attractive rate and repurpose it to some other tenant? If that winds up\u2026 John Case : That is not a big emphasis of our business. We pay attention to those opportunities, but we are really looking for assets with long lease terms that are well positioned competitively, and we're not going to have any sort of near-term issues for. If we saw something incredibly compelling we would certainly take a look at it where we had a kind of tenant in our back pocket, and we knew we were going to sign a 20 year lease on favourable terms, on a building that was going to become vacant or vacant, we would certainly look at that. We've done that in the past. Is not a major component of our business, but we have done that in the past. Operator : And will go next to Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hey, John, good afternoon. John Case : Hey, Ross. Ross Nussbaum : It sounds like from some of your earlier comments, regarding acquisitions and in particular M&A it sounds like you are more open to M&A today than you have been in the recent past. Do you think that's a fair characterization? John Case : I would say given the multiple advantage we have relative to the other 13, 14 companies in the sector that it's a bit more interesting today. But, at the same time, I would say that we want to end up with assets that are consistent with our investment philosophy. So we're not signaling that we go out there just to do a large transaction, take on assets that we couldn't, we'd consider to be of risk in the intermediate to long-term. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. And, you and I have talked about this topic before but how do you think about net asset value or property value versus investment spread? So even if you theoretically could buy another public player at a multiple that would be accreted to your FFO, what if that meant paying a reasonably high, I don't know what the right word is, premium to the actual value of the assets when you know you can go into the private market all day long and pay actual NAV or property value? How do you balance that thinking? John Case : We want to be paying NAV whether we're buying in the private market or whether we're buying in the public market. There would have to be something incredibly compelling about the opportunity strategically for us to do that, but we're focused both on spreads and accretion as well as the value of the assets. So we would not want to do anything that would be NAV dilutive. Operator : And will go next to Amit Nihalani of Oppenheimer. Amit Nihalani : Hi, good afternoon. Can you guys comment on the difference in cap rates for industrial versus retail? John Case : Yes, Sumit, industrial versus retail? Sumit Roy : We haven't really seen much of a movement in cap rates for the type of industrial assets that we pursue which is Fortune 1000 clients with ten plus years. In terms of the cost you're paying right around that $65 to $75 to $80 per square feet for brand new concrete tilt up type of buildings, and that seems to still be the case today. With retail, as depending on the product type it ranges from anywhere between 150 to 250 square feet all the way up to 400, 450 for a C store. So, and again with regards to pricing despite all the volatility that we're seeing in the market, we have not seen cap rates move in one direction or the other. They stayed fairly steady for both those products I'd say over the last six to nine months. Amit Nihalani : Got it and just bigger picture any changes to the watch list or anything else we should be aware of on that front? John Case : No. The watch list is down to 1% of revenues which is the lowest it's been in the last five years. Again the portfolio is in good health. There are no material issues for us. Operator : And will go next to Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors. Tyler Grant : Hello, guys. Just a quick question for me. What do you see as being the right size for realty income in terms of assets? John Case : The right size? In terms of assets? I don't think there is necessarily a right size, but we will continue to grow the Company consistent with our investments strategies and take advantage of the opportunities out there in what is a vast marketplace. So, we do not have a target in terms of size. It's really more about delivering earnings growth and dividend growth and total shareholder return. Tyler Grant : All right. Sure. In terms of do you think that there would be anything more attractive about just having $25 billion worth of assets instead of having call it $18 billion worth of assets? John Case : No. I don't think so. This is a very scalable business. When you look at our EBITDA margin that's nearly 94%, it's sector leading. We're delivering more of our revenues to our shareholders than the rest of the sector. Our G&A margin of 5%, very efficient. With size and scale comes increased efficiencies, which really lead to I think a competitive advantage based on size. But we wouldn't grow just to grow, we would grow to create earnings growth and dividend growth with assets consistent with our investment philosophy. Operator : And we will go next to Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : The deal flow you're seeing continues to be pretty steady and robust. Can you provide what the mix is maybe just share what the percentages if you look at where the opportunities came from, investment opportunities, came from last year whether they are marketed details, existing relationships or pension funds even bringing you opportunities? John Case : Sure. So Sumit, do you want to take that? Sumit Roy : Yes, sure. So Todd, in terms of the portfolio and one-off mix, I would say it's about 25% of what we sourced last year versus even in 2015 was about the same. 25% is one off, 75% portfolio deals. So when you start to focus then on the portfolio deals what we've started to notice is a lot more companies that were sort of hesitant in years past to even engage in conversations dealing with sale lease backs became far more open to those types of conversations, and in fact some of them even resulted in transactions that we were involved in, in last year. Whereas in 2014, most of the product that we saw were from companies that were very familiar with the sale leaseback market and most of the volume driven were by either other sellers of large portfolios both private and public and/or companies that had done sale-leasebacks in the past. So the only real change in terms of the product mix I would say that we saw was new entrants coming in that had not engaged in conversations in years past. But outside of that, one-off versus portfolio, the mix is about the same. It was 26% in 2014 and 25% in 2015. So, I'd say the mix is about the same. Todd Stender : Is it more compelling, Sumit, just because of pricing -- commercial real estate prices have been so good people are at least considering it now? Sumit Roy : I would say pricing is definitely one piece of it, but I would also say that there has been a fair amount of external pressures by investors, etcetera rattling the cages and talking about what is it that a particular operating company should focus on. The debt markets have helped. The fact that our cap rates have compressed have helped, but I think the single biggest issue has always, the single biggest driver in my mind has been some of the investors talking about monetizing real estate and getting back to the core business. I think that has been the single biggest factor. Operator : And we will go next to Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Rich Moore : So, Sumit, are you sort of saying that -- and, John, that the -- remember when we had all these retailers that wanted to do spins, spins of their real estate, and that is sort of not happening now. The government has kind of shut that down, so is that group of potential sale-leaseback guys coming to? Are you seeing more of that, those pre-spin guys that can't do the spins anymore? John Case : Yes, I think that was actually favorable news to the net lease industry and companies like ours to the extent they want to monetize their real estate they're going to be talking to us. I do think to add on to what Sumit was saying is that these companies that have large real estate holdings that are not real estate companies are under pressure to increase their own returns on investment and carrying that real estate when it could be sold to someone like us or someone in our sector can certainly enhance their return on investment, so there is that pressure and we're seeing that. The recent news with regard to the ability to do these spins is certainly a net positive to the sector. Rich Moore : Okay, good, thank you. And then it's interesting because you guys probably don't sit and look at the stock market all day long like a bunch of us on the phone do, but pretty much the only thing green on my screen is you guys. That means the market is worried about something, and I'm curious how you guys monitor for bankruptcies? I mean what's the chance among your tenant base that you can have a surprise in there and how close are you in touch do you think with the health of each of these retailers? John Case : So we have a -- as you know, you've covered us for a long time, as you know Rich, we have our own internal credit and research team, and we are constantly analyzing and scouring the portfolio in terms of credit and industry trends as well. Currently, our watch list is 1%. Tenants that we have potential credit issues with are just under 6% of the entire portfolio, but most of that doesn't make it on to the watchlist because it's really good real estate and we'd like to have it back, and we think there's upside there. So in terms of our coverages they've held steady right around 2.6, 2.7 we're not anticipating any sort of a tenant -- material tenant the issues. So we to track that very closely and don't see anything there. Operator : We will go next to Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann. Dan Donlan : Thank you, good afternoon. John given your comments on M&A I think you said that public debt the REITs would have to have as that are consistent with your investment philosophy. How many REITs out there do you think have such assets? Rich Moore : Dan, you are cutting out. Dan Donlan : Sorry. Can you hear me now better? John Case : Yes. Dan Donlan : Sorry about that. Given that you said that as you look at some public to public M&A that another Company would have to have assets that are consistent with your investment philosophy. I was just kind of curious how many REITs are out there that you think have assets that are consistent with your investment philosophy? John Case : There are a number of them. Are there any that are completely pure? Maybe one or two, but in terms of the REITs that have assets that are consistent with what we're looking for and have a material amount of them, maybe they represent 50% or more. There are a lot of companies out there. Dan Donlan : I then just kind of curious on the casual dining front. It's been a sector that you guys have steered clear of since the last recession, was just kind of curious, your appetite there. Just going back to Rich's question, given the inability of these REIT conversions to happen there's a lot of restaurants out there that that still own a lot of their own real estate, so just kind of curious your thoughts there? John Case : Yes so right now, casual dining for us is about 3.5% of our overall revenues, and some of the stumbles the Company has made in the past have been related to casual dining. And we've learned what we want on that front, and so we have a fairly high bar in terms of what we would consider there. We want operating concepts that are stable to growing. We want box sizes that if we ever get them back are of the size that we can be more easily re-let. We want market rents. We want something close to replacement cost as well, and we want coverages that are in excess of what our portfolio averages somewhere around three times. So if we find those types of opportunities, and of course the real estate needs to be attractive as well, we'll pursue them. So, the fact that we've not done many of them is more a function of quality and structure of some of the transactions that have been done versus us saying we won't look at casual dining, because we will look at casual dining. But the parameters around what we will invest in our fairly tight. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Collin Mings of Raymond James. Collin Mings : First question for me you guys mentioned the watchlist remains low and hasn't really changed much. But can you maybe just highlight what the themes are as you think about the planned dispositions for this year? And could we see some shift maybe towards some more occupied versus vacant properties? And then just as it relates to that issue, going back to Rich's question, could some of the dispositions be maybe in that pool of tenants that aren't necessarily on the watchlist but maybe in lower quality given some of the economic concerns other? John Case : Yes, I mean on the dispositions front, I think in terms of what would be selling, it will look similar to what it looked like in 2015, maybe a bit more occupied than vacant. We had more vacant than we typically have. And the types of properties on the dispositions front are casual dining, childcare, older generation, non-discretionary -- I'm sorry, discretionary tenants in theory or real estate locations perhaps with credit issues. Or they are higher quality properties, but we're looking to reduce our exposure to certain tenant or to a certain sector. So on the sales front I think you'll see a little more occupied then vacant in terms of the ratio, and we're looking to sell 50 million to 75 million this year, and that's incorporated into our guidance. Collin Mings : I guess along those lines just as far as how does your economic outlook maybe factor into that at all? I think last year there was some acceleration in your disposition activity. Is there anything from a broader economic perspective that might again cause you to accelerate or want to jettison some more some of that exposure that you highlighted that you are relatively more concerned about? John Case : No, again when you look at the size of the watch list and it's in your 1%, it's fairly small. So possibly we've had I think our most active year on the dispositions front was about $135 million and we've been as low as 50 million, 60 million. We're kind of thinking 50 million to 75 million, but we remain the right to be flexible there. We certainly did factor in macroeconomic conditions, but it's really that then taken down to the micro level and does it make sense for the reasons I went through to sell an asset or not. Operator : And this concludes the question and answer portion of Realty income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. John Case : Okay, thank you very much, Cassandra. Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you at the conferences coming up and everyone have a good afternoon. Take care. Bye. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC Operator : Please stand by, we\u2019re about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s first quarter 2016 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be : John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. And we\u2019re pleased to begin the year with an active quarter for acquisitions and healthy AFFO per share growth of 4.5% to $0.70. As announced in yesterday\u2019s press release we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $750 million to approximately $900 million and reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90 as we anticipate another solid year of earnings and dividend growth. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks, John. I\u2019m going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $2.2 million to $60.7 million. This increase was due to the recognition of a non-cash loss of approximately $5.8 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, theses mark-to-market adjustments on our floating to fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there is significant movement in short-term forward curve rates as we saw in the first quarter. Naturally, this evaluation will fluctuate based on the outlook for interest rates. Last quarter, it resulted in a $4.1 million non-cash gain. We do adjust for these non-cash gains or losses when computing our cash AFFO earnings. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and over $300 million in mortgages over the last 12 months. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong and continue to tick higher with interest coverage of 4.6 times and fixed charge coverage of 4.1 times. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been in well over 10 years. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was less than 4.8%, which continues to be the lowest percentage in the net-lease sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.3%. As a percentage of revenues, these expenses came in slightly higher than normal due to temporarily higher carry costs on some vacant properties and some timing issues on tenant reimbursements which will be received in the second quarter. We continue to estimate our run-rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. Last year, we established an ATM or At-the-Market equity distribution program. In the first quarter we utilized this program to issue 500,000 shares, generating net proceeds of approximately $31 million. Our $2 billion credit facility has a balance of approximately $650 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.8 million in mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $22 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. And finally, our debt to EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.3 times, and is only 5.8 times inclusive of preferred equity. Now, let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results. John Case : Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.8%. Occupancy declined a bit due to a number of leases expiring during the quarter, including leases rejected through the Buffets Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in March. We are working through this additional vacancy with our re-leasing and sales efforts and continue to expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. Economic occupancy was 98.8%. On the 38 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured a 112% of the expiring rents, which represents our strongest quarterly recapture rate since we began recording this metric in 2014. As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvement. Our re-leasing results reflect the high quality of our real estate portfolio, testament to our disciplined investment underwriting and proactive portfolio management efforts. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our net-lease peers who also report this metric. Our same store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter. And we expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we never had a year with negative same store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 243 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the first quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant accounting for 6.8% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second-half of this year by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents about 2% of our annualized rental revenue. The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased to 2.7 times on a four-wall basis and the median remained at 2.6 times for the first quarter. Moving on to acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $353 million in acquisitions, at record spreads through our weighted average cost of capital. And we continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisition. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring just 6% of the amount we sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As a remainder, our revised acquisitions guidance of approximately $900 million principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transaction. I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit, to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2016, we invested $353 million in 103 properties, located in 31 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.8 years. On a revenue basis, 23% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 26 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships. We closed 19 independent transactions in the first quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $3.4 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $6 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 48% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 52% or more than $3 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 30% for the first quarter. Of the $353 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter 37% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 47 year operating history. As to pricing cap rates remained flat in the first quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for net proceeds of $11 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 255 basis points in the first quarter which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year WACC. In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $900 million. We remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. With that, I\u2019d like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks, Sumit. Following the very active year we had in the capital markets in 2015 we raised $35 million in common equity during the first quarter. Approximately $31 million of the equity raise during the quarter was through our ATM program. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to market cap of approximately 24%, debt to EBITDA of 5.3 times and a debt service coverage ratio of 4.6 times. We currently have more than $1.3 billion of capacity on our $2 billion revolving line of credit providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our sector-leading cost to capital and balance sheet flexibility allows us to drive earnings per share and dividend growth while remaining disciplined with our investment and underwriting strategy. Last month, we announced our 85th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83%, a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had a solid quarter and remain optimistic for 2016. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we were best-positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and distinct cost of capital advantage. At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning on the West Coast. Just hoping you could speak a little bit to the watch-list you may have, and in particular, any potential vacancies if some of the tenants like Sports Authority or Friendly\u2019s, if all their stores went dark, what would be the delta in occupancy under that sort of bear case scenario? John Case : Sure, I can address the watch-list then touch on vacancies. The watch-list is now at 0.8%. Juan, as you remember, we have a credit watch-list that\u2019s 5.8%. And then, we have an overall watch-list and that overall watch-list incorporates everything, including the quality of the real estate location, industry trends, concentrations we may have, not just credit. So those are the size of the two watch-lists at this point. With regard to - when we look at the material exposures that we have, we feel like we are in very good shape. With regard to Sports Authority, which we typically do not talk about tenants outside of our top-20, they been in our top-20 before and obviously they\u2019re in the news, so we didn\u2019t want to address that today. Sports Authority, we have minimal exposure to, well under 1% of grant. The stores that we have are receiving significant interest from a number of national retailers, some sporting goods stores, but also retailers outside of that sector. Our cash flows on those stores, our capital coverages are quite strong. And I think this morning, as you probably saw they announced that they were going to pursue liquidation. Our guidance has incorporated our expectations with regard to Sports Authority and any other credit issues into it. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re sticking with - on the AFFO per share $2.85 to $2.90. So we think we\u2019re going to end up the year at occupancy of approximately 98%. We\u2019re at 97.8% today. And obviously we started the year off at 98.4%. The biggest hit was in the first quarter, late in the first quarter when we received the Ovation Brands\u2019 or Buffets\u2019 properties back. And that was the sole reason or principally the sole reason for the downtick in occupancy. And they came in late in the quarter, so we didn\u2019t have a lot of opportunity to work those properties in terms of re-leasing and sales. Juan Sanabria : Great. And just one follow-up question, separate topic, could you give us a sense of what percentage of restaurants where you kind of call them out in terms of the first quarter deal volume. And I know you guys had previously been a little bit bearish in your discourse about casual dining. What in particular around the brands you may have acquired was appealing to you? And if you could, maybe talk to some of the valuation numbers around that. John Case : Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll address casual dining. We invested in QSR restaurants as well as casual dining restaurants in the first quarter. We are consistent with what we said regarding casual dining. We\u2019ve not made many investments in casual dining restaurants here over the last five years, just a few and none that have been material. But when we do look at casual dining restaurants, we have a very high underwriting hurdle rate. So we want coverages well north of 3 times, 4 times we can get it. We want footprints that are smaller, 6,000 square feet in that area that is fungible and we want rents that approximate market and we want to be invested at replacement cost or near-replacement cost. And we want to be invested in a concept that\u2019s stable or improving. And most of what we\u2019ve seen over the last five years has not met that hurdle. But when it does we meet those hurdles. We are comfortable buying casual dining restaurants. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Robert Stevenson : Good afternoon, guys. Can you talk a little bit about in terms of the acquisitions you made during the quarter? Was it a certain asset, certain group of asset, certain type of tenant or whatever, that sort of pushed the cap rate down into the 6% range? John Case : Yes, the - no, it wasn\u2019t really anything other than having to do with the quality of the assets. As you know, last year our average cap rate was 6.6% for the quarter. It was 6.6% here for the first quarter in 2016. And the cap rate is reflective of the quality of the assets. And it\u2019s as simple as that. It wasn\u2019t one type of asset that really drove it. Robert Stevenson : Okay. And then, in terms of the way we should be thinking about the sort of hundred or so leases you have expiring throughout the year, I mean, what\u2019s your expectations at this point for a conversion ratio in terms of renewing those leases versus ones that are likely to go vacant at least temporarily? John Case : Yes. I mean, again, we think we are going to - the easiest way to answer this question is we think we\u2019re going to end up at approximately 98% of occupancy. So this is relatively for us a light year from here on out with regard to lease rollover. So we would expect to - our historical rate has been to re-let about 70% for the same tenant, 20% to new tenants and sell about 10%. Whether we match that or not this year, I am not sure. But, again, we feel good about the prospects on those properties that we have that expire during the remaining three quarters of the year. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Just on the acquisitions trajectory, you guys had a very nice quarter, the first quarter. But just looking at the guidance, most of the raise is a just flow-through from sort of what you\u2019ve done in the first quarter. And you typically don\u2019t see a sort of slowdown in the trajectory. Generally, second or third quarter seems to be - you seemed to have a quarter in the past. I\u2019m just kind of wondering what - is there something different, is there something got a push-back and is this more kind of maybe the first quarter strong and then the fourth quarter strong as well. John Case : Well, our quarterly acquisitions in the recent years have been anywhere from $125 million to $750 million. So they are very difficult to predict. And you\u2019ve heard us use this word, Vikram, a thousand times, but their lumpy. And you can\u2019t take one quarter and extrapolate from that quarter what acquisitions are going to be for the year. So we were really pleased with the first quarter. We think we are going to have a good year. Hence, we raised our acquisitions guidance for the year, $900 million, but there\u2019s no smoothness to being able to project it by quarter upfront. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, fair enough. And then, can you just update us on how you\u2019re viewing the office - your office and industrial holdings. There has been some more mixed commentary on both sectors. I\u2019m just kind of wondering how you view them as part of the portfolio. And if you can just update us, I believe there is a change in personnel on the industrial side. If you could update us on who is managing that now. John Case : So let me start with office and then we\u2019ll get into the personnel side of it. First of all, we do not actively seek office on a standalone basis. Office represents 6% of our rental revenue. Office has come into the company really in one of two ways, either through portfolio acquisitions, where 85%, 90% are more of the assets where assets that met our investment strategy or through relationships with major tenants where we had - for instance, a major retail tenant come to us and ask us to do a, say, leaseback on their office headquarters. So if we\u2019re comfortable with the structure and the investment, we would do that for relationship purposes. So we don\u2019t intend to grow the office exposure. Industrial right now is about 13%. And we have a high, again, hurdle rate for industrial. We\u2019re looking for Fortune 1000 tenants, fungible buildings and significant or mission-critical building markets leased to investment-grade tenants. So on the industrial-front, this change happened quite a while ago. But Ben Fox and Greg Libby now are the two people who head up our industrial effort. And they\u2019ve been doing that now for probably close to a year now. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the strength of the 1031 market and what you\u2019re seeing there, and then just pricing overall with larger portfolios versus individual assets. John Case : Sure. The 1031 market has come back and is strong. So we\u2019re seeing good bids in that market or aggressive pricing. I think if you took, for instance, a QSR property and put it in a $200 million portfolio. It probably trades at a cap rate that\u2019s may be 50 to 75 basis points higher than where it would if it were trading on its own, so there is an arb between where one-off assets trade and where larger portfolios trade. The pricing on the portfolios has remained consistent as Sumit really laid out in his opening remarks. Nicholas Joseph : And how many larger portfolios, I guess, relative to historical averages are out there today to be acquired? John Case : We\u2019re seeing - there\u2019s really been no drop off in our transaction opportunity flow. We had a very good quarter at $6.2 billion. And we were optimistic about the pipeline and continue to work a number of opportunities on our larger portfolios, some are one-off assets. But no change from our previous trend. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to RJ Milligan with Baird. R.J. Milligan: Hey, guys. John, just on your comments on the casual dining sector, curious if you looked at the Bloomin [ph] portfolio, I think given your comments, maybe you looked at it, but didn\u2019t spend much time looking at it. John Case : Yeah. We don\u2019t comment on specific transactions. I\u2019ve laid out the conditions under which we would invest in a casual dining portfolio. So I think I\u2019ve answered that. R.J. Milligan: Okay. And, Sumit, you mentioned that you were seeing some non-investment grades going at the high 5s. I was just curious what kind of properties or industries those assets were trading at pretty low cap rates? Sumit Roy : Yes. If you look at the QSR sector, if you look at even small franchisees, they are trading in that ZIP code and they are certainly non-investment grade. The other group that we see quite often are C-stores. They are very aggressively priced, some even in the mid-five ZIP code. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities. Vineet Khanna : Yeah. Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Can you provide some color on the makeup of that $352 million of first quarter activity? Specifically were there any single large deals in there? John Case : Sumit? Sumit Roy : No, if you look at our average per property, we bought about 109 properties. It\u2019s about $3.4 million. So it wasn\u2019t dictated by any one very large asset transactions. We had 19 independent transactions. There were certainly some portfolios we did. 52% of what we did was a leaseback. And I think in my opening remarks I\u2019ve mentioned that 67% of what we did were portfolio deals. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the volume. Vineet Khanna : Okay, sure. And then just looking at a broader sporting goods retailer sector, can you talk about your general sporting goods retailer exposure, and then specifically your Gander Mountain exposure and just the health of that tenant. Sumit Roy : So we look at the sporting goods industry, if you will, as the story of two worlds really. You got the very good operators in Academy and Dick\u2019s and to some extent Modell\u2019s and then you have the situation that we are seeing playing out in the public press with the Sports Authority. With regards to - and those are the ones that we believe to be very good operators, they continue to do reasonably well despite the fact that they happen to be in a discretionary industry and are competing. But they do have the omni-channel strategy. So they do have their brick and mortars. They do have their Internet strategy as well. And they continue to produce very solid results. With regards to Gander Mountain and what is our exposure there, it is - if I remember correctly, it isn\u2019t very high. And it certainly doesn\u2019t even come close to being in our top 20. So we do have a couple, but it\u2019s insignificant. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Tyler Grant with Green Street Advisors. Tyler Grant : Guys, how are you doing? John Case : Good. How are you doing, Tyler? Tyler Grant : Good, good. Just want to pick your brain today regarding the definition of AFFO. So to start it off, most REITs in the net lease space, when they define AFFO they add back non-cash compensation. I understand the rationale given that AFFO itself is supposed to be a non-cash measure. However, given that the equity compensation represents a significant portion of management\u2019s compensation, do you think that it makes sense to add this back into the AFFO metric? John Case : Paul? Paul Meurer : Yes, I mean, Tyler we\u2019re not going to debate how we calculate this metric kind of in this forum. What I will tell you is, what we tried to do is provide great disclosure. And specific to that would be not only that how FFO is calculated in accordance with NAREIT, but then the adjustments that we think are appropriate to arrive at what we think is kind of a cash earnings per share number AFFO-wise. And by laying out that disclosure very clearly we allow analysts to pick and choose in different manners. And certainly through the years many analysts out there have calculated CAD or FAD or AFFO or whatever they want to call it, in their own manner. And so we certainly understand if someone chooses to not include a particular category there, we just laid out what we think is the appropriate measurement of kind of a run rate for us of a cash operating earnings AFFO quarter-to-quarter. Tyler Grant : All right. Sure. I appreciate the color. Moving on to the next question, regarding cap rates, all else equal, what would you say is the cap rate spread between AA rated assets relative to, let\u2019s say, BBB minus rated assets or tenants? John Case : The cap rates are really driven more by the quality of the real estate and less by the credit. So it\u2019s very hard to answer that question and isolate it. But you can certainly have high-quality real estate leased to non-investment grade tenants that trade at cap rates that are inside of where real estate leased investment-grade tenants trade. So we don\u2019t really get hang up on whether it\u2019s investment-grade or not. We start with an underwriting of the real estate and does it fall within our investment parameters which we\u2019ve laid out to the market. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi, guys, thanks. Just to hone in on some of the specific transactions that occurred, just three of them, if we could look at the carrying cap rates and lease terms, maybe get a sense of what the FedEx was acquired for CVSs. And then it looks like you sold some of the NPC assets, which I think are Pizza Huts. Just seeing if you can provide some color on that stuff? John Case : Sumit? Sumit Roy : Yes, so the FedEx was a forward that we entered into. And if you look at - obviously you\u2019ve got the blended cap rate of 6.6%. But I\u2019ll tell you, we are looking at FedEx 15-year deals in the market that trading in the mid-5s. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why if you look at what our development cap rate or yield was, it was in that 6.8 ZIP code. It is because a couple of our forwards came into very high quality forward transactions closed. And John has mentioned this in some of the questions that he\u2019s answered that. That is a significant delta between some of these forwards that we had entered into as well as portfolio deals that we had entered into and the one-off market that we\u2019ve seen in today\u2019s environment. So that\u2019s the response in the FedEx. You mentioned that we did sell a couple of NPCs. And you are absolutely right; those are Pizza Hut branded assets. That is something that we are consciously been going through and calling our assets on. I mean, assets that we believe no longer fit our strategic objectives we are trying to call them. And it wasn\u2019t a very big disposition quarter for us, but we expect to get rid of anywhere between $50 million to $75 million of assets through the year. Todd Stender : And just for pricing for CVSs, looks like you picked up a few. Sumit Roy : Yes. On some of the CVSs, we actually got them through a small portfolio deal, where we handpicked the assets that we wanted to close on. And we got them at very good cap rates, just given the fact that it was a portfolio deal. Again, if we were to simply go out there and flip out of those. I think there is certainly a fairly healthy spread that we would be able to achieve and those are very well located CVSs. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Karin Ford with MUFG. Karin Ford : Hi, good afternoon. Just a clarification, you raised investment guidance, but you left AFFO guidance unchanged. And the reason why it was just increasing conservatism on credit issues in the portfolio? John Case : No, it\u2019s really, Karin, driven by when we anticipate those additional acquisitions coming online. I think they\u2019ll be back-end weighted. So they\u2019ll have more of an impact on 2017\u2019s AFFO per share than they will this year. So given the fact that they\u2019re back-end weighted, the increase did not have a significant increase on what our annualized projected numbers were for this year. It\u2019s just a timing issue. Karin Ford : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then second question, do you have any update on potential store closures in your portfolio in the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger? John Case : No, we don\u2019t. We really had very little overlap with regard to properties. We\u2019ve got 15 properties of Rite-Aid properties that are within a 2-mile radius of the Walgreens store. So we expect minimal fallout and overall excited about this merger. The average lease term on these properties is just under 13 years, so even if one were to be closed, obviously, Walgreens would stay on the hook for lease payments that period of time. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James. Collin Mings : Hey, good afternoon. First question for Paul, maybe can you just update us, remind us on how you\u2019re thinking about handling the 2016 debt maturities, just maybe in terms of term and size and just maybe update us on the debt market pricing right now? Paul Meurer : Sure. So you know the schedule, but basically we have a $275 million bond coming due in mid-September and only about $22 million of mortgages remaining this year in terms of maturities. So $300 million total, call it, on the liability side. Certainly, we\u2019re positioned liquidity-wise to deal with that, even if we did temporarily on the credit line or something of that nature. But so it\u2019s not a big tall order if you will for balance of the year. So we are monitoring the market, we\u2019ve been generally pleased with our equity pricing as well as debt pricing, and debt pricing in particular, I\u2019d say it has improved over the past couple of weeks as that market settled in. Today, we could do a 10-year somewhere around 375 all-in coupon, so that\u2019s very favorable 10-year debt pricing and something we would strongly be considering. But we\u2019ll continue to monitor the market how the stock price does and what the bond market look and feel like over the next handful of months. Collin Mings : Okay. And I think, Paul, you\u2019ve indicated in previous call that maybe minimum size will be 250 for a debt offering. I mean just how comfortable would you get as far as magnitude as far as size of an offering? Paul Meurer : I think, we would lean towards something larger to the extent that we could do something larger and provide more liquidity for bond investors today, we think on balance, you may get more favorable pricing in that manner. And by that I mean probably something $500 million area or more. But we\u2019ll think about the appropriate size at that time. 250, I would say historically was more of a minimum to provide that sort of liquidity, but I think the market is asking for more these days. So we would consider something more in the $500-million-plus range. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Rich Moore : Hi, good morning, guys, or good morning out there. Paul, I want to follow-up if I could on that last question. And if you think more broadly about what you guys have, you have $650 million on the line of credit, the 275 bond, another $600 million, let\u2019s say of acquisitions. So you have really more like $1.5 billion to $2 billion of capital needs for the rest of the year and I wish you would stay this way, but I don\u2019t think interest rates always stay low and I don\u2019t think stock prices always stay high. And I\u2019m wondering if there is more of a sense of urgency, even if you have to sort of frontload the balance sheet a little bit with a little bit of cash to do more transactions to clear some of this? John Case : Hey, Rich, I\u2019ll start and then hand it over to Paul. If you look at the size of the company today, $650 million on the revolver represents about 3% of our capitalization. If you go back to the end of 2012, 30% of our capitalization was $250 million on the line. So given the growth and the size of the company, our relative exposure is no different than really what we\u2019ve done in the past. And the balance sheet, as you know, is in excellent shape and by many measures it\u2019s in the best shape it\u2019s been in 10 years. So we have substantial equity. We did nibble away at the way at the equity through the ATM program in the first quarter that we didn\u2019t want to do anything substantive and dilute our current shareholders and over-equitize the balance sheet. So we\u2019re watching the markets quite closely for permanent funding and debt funding. But we\u2019re quite comfortable here and with our obligations for the remainder of the year. Paul, anything you\u2019d like to add to that? Paul Meurer : No, the only thing I would add is that we\u2019re very pleased to have a larger line in place. And that provides great liquidity, not only the $2 billion size, but the $1 billion accordion expansion feature on it gives us great comfort relative to our acquisition efforts and needs, and allowing us to be patient and pick our spots on the permanent capital front. Rich Moore : Okay. All right. Good. Thank you. And then the other question I had for you is you guys had mentioned a while back that you were using obviously this opportunity with your stock price having moved up and if you take a look at bigger transactions like a non-traded REIT or maybe another public company something like that. And I\u2019m wondering if you guys just maybe use a partner to do something little broader even and is that still something you guys are considering or pondering or is that kind of not really on the table? John Case : Yes, Rich, this is John. You cut out for a second, but I think we got the gist of what you said. Our statement on these sort of questions is that we\u2019re looking at all opportunities in the marketplace, so private and public that make sense for our shareholders. And we\u2019ll continue to do so. So that kind of sums it up. I think I said that on the last call and don\u2019t really think to add anything to that. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, just one follow-up question for me. There\u2019s been some press articles about potential reforms to the 1031 law that allows the tax deferral of gains, maybe limiting that deferral amount or some outright repeals. Any thoughts on kind of what\u2019s going on in Congress, your sense of what may or may not happen there and any potential implications if there is a change to the market? John Case : We\u2019re not anticipating any changes with regard to the 1031 taxation policies. So at this point, we\u2019re not concerned, Juan. Washington is unpredictable, but getting change through is often pretty difficult and takes a long time. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Paul Meurer : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. John Case : Thanks, Tracey. And we appreciate everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming conferences including NAREIT in early June. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma'am. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s Second Quarter 2016 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be : John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call; in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have an additional question please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. We\u2019re pleased to report another active quarter for acquisitions and healthy AFFO per share growth of 4.4% to $0.71. As announced in yesterday\u2019s Press Release we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $900 million to approximately $1.25 billion and reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90. 0:01:57.4 : Our balance sheet is now in the best shape in our company\u2019s history. Based on the ongoing confidence we have in our business and our financial strength, we\u2019ve elected to provide our shareholders with an additional 1% increase in the monthly dividend payable in September which represents a 6.1% increase over September of 2015. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks, John. I will provide a few highlights for some items in our financial statements for the quarter. Starting with the income statement; other revenue in this quarter was a negative amount negative 129,000. This was a result of a reclassification of some revenue from other revenue that was book in Q1 to rental revenue that it is reflected here in Q2. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.4% this quarter, due to higher stock compensation cost for our Board of Directors in the quarter. The stock grant occurred in May and our higher stock prices in spring caused this expense to be a little higher. Year-to-date SG&A is only 5.1% of revenues and we\u2019re still projecting approximately 5% for the year. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.4% and we\u2019re still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We\u2019ve raised $487 million of common equity capital thus far this year our $2 billion credit facility which has a $1 billion expansion option has a balance of approximately $530 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.6 million of our mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remained in very good shape, with only $5 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due during the second half of 2016. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Finally, our overall leverage remains low with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.1 times. So in summary we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and good excess to both equity and debt capital, both which are well priced financial alternatives for us right now. Let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background. John Case : Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 20 basis points increase from last quarter. Economic occupancy was 98.9% also up from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. From the 37 properties we re-leased during the quarter we recaptured 92% of the expiring rent. As it\u2019s typical for us we had no spending on tenant improvements in connection with our re-leasing. Year-to-date we have recaptured a 103% of expiring rent on 75 lease rollovers which remains well above our long term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with expiring leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our net-lease, our peer companies who also report this metric. Our same store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. Approximately 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. We remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties, without having to incur any significant recurring maintenance capital expenditures to generate this growth. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 246 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the second quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenues and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.7 times on a four wall basis and the median remained 2.6 times. Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $310 million in acquisitions during the quarter and for the first half of the year, we completed $663 million in acquisitions, at record high investment spreads related to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. For the first half of the year, we sourced approximately $15 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring under 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.25 billion and continue to acquire the highest quality net leased properties as we grow our portfolio. I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit Roy, to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions activities. Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2016, we invested $310 million in 57 properties, located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years. On a revenue basis, 58% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 68% of the revenues are generated from retail and 32% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and discount grocery stores. We closed 22 independent transactions in the second quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $5.4 million. Year-to-date 2016 we invested $663 million in a 154 properties located in 34 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 78% of the revenues are generated from retail and 22% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 23 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our casual dining restaurants, transportation services and motor vehicle dealerships. Of the 41 independent transactions closed year-to-date one transactions was about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $8 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately $15 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $6 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 64% for the second quarter. Of the $300 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 65% were one-off transactions. After pricing, cap rates remained flat in the second quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 15 properties for net proceeds of $24 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. This brings us to 26 properties sold year-to-date for $35 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.4%, unrealized an unlevered IRR of 9.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 252 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.25 billion and we remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. With that, I\u2019d like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thank you, Sumit. As I mentioned, we have successfully issued approximately $0.5 billion in common equity year-to-date. Approximately $55 million of the equity raised was executed opportunistically through our ATM program during the final week of June and reflect at the lowest cost of equity raised in our company\u2019s history. Today, our investment spreads related to our nominal cost of equity are well in excess of our historical investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, which allows us to drive earnings growth as well as further strengthen our balance sheet. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to total market cap of approximately 21% and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1 times. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. We are pleased that our sector leading credit strength was recognized in the second quarter by Moody\u2019s and S&P, both of which upgraded us giving positive outlook while reaffirming our BAA1 and BBB+ credit ratings. Yesterday we announced our 87th dividend increase payable in September which represents a 6.1% increase over the dividend in September of 2015. We\u2019ve increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had another good quarter and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our sector leading cost-to-capital and balance sheet flexibility. At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll first hear from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m curious know why the initial yields and this cap rates on Q2 investments came in at 6.3% looks it goes down from 6.6% in 1Q. Did that have to do with just asset mix that you purchased or was that a broader move in cap rates across the board? John Case : That was really a function of the assets repurchase. In first quarter, our average cap rates was 6.5% and we round it down to 6.3% for the second quarter. So it\u2019s really a reflection of the high quality properties which would include great real estate locations good investment structures as well as the quality of the tenant and the industry; and we also had a fairly high percentage for the quarter of investment grade tenants during just under 60%, which is higher than we typically see and that also help to drive the pricing in that. But for the year, we\u2019re still guiding to somewhere right around 6.5%, Josh. Joshua Dennerlein : Thanks, I appreciate that. So it sounds like you really haven\u2019t seen any moving cap rates from my perspective we\u2019ve just - we\u2019ve seen the 10 year drop pretty substantially post breaks it both. So we weren\u2019t sure if it was translating into any moves across asset types. John Case : We\u2019ve not seen any movements in cap rates in our sector. We kind a look at it is investment grade and non-investment grade. And on the investment grade side we\u2019re still seen a cap rate range by anywhere from the low-fives up into the high sixes on the initial yield. And on the non-investment grade product we\u2019re seeing anything from an initial yield high-five\u2019s up to around just north of 8% and that\u2019s exactly where it was a quarter ago. So we haven\u2019t seen and react to due to the change in capital cost that\u2019s resulted in all time high on spreads that we\u2019re experiencing right now. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Robert Stevenson : Good afternoon, guys. John, can you talk a little bit about the magnitude of the sale leaseback transactions that are in the market. I assume in your billions of dollars of deals that you\u2019ve look at, if you look at a few of those. I mean how robust is that today? Are some of the tenants pulling back on that or you seeing an acceleration of those type of deals whether or not you guys are doing them or just to even looking at them? John Case : Yeah, I mean, we are seeing a nice glow of sale leaseback opportunities. When you look at what we have done to date and seen, it is running near 40%. So, there is a great deal of activity out there. Overall, in terms of sourced opportunities year-to-date, we are in the proximally $15 billion, that is a good number. We can continue to see good transaction flow. And some of that flow is sale leaseback opportunities, large ones with single tenants which are well positioned to do. We we\u2019ll see whether they happen or not. So, we are still seeing good investment opportunities. Robert Stevenson : And given your tenants concentration, I mean, what is your tolerance these days size wise for any of these transactions? I mean, anything that would wind-up elevating somebody in your top five or seven tenants? John Case : Well, I\u2019ll say this, in terms of tenants, we like to see them in the mid to high single-digits. You want to maintain our diversification and we want it to be the right tenant in terms of industry. We want to see industries in the low double-digits. Now, we may have period of time where we go above those levels for tenants and industries, but we will manage back down to be diversified. So, 5% of ramp represents a transaction of about $750 million. So, that will kind of give you an idea, I think that covers it. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think, just take a picture of you guys in some of your peers I know it\u2019s a fairly unique situation from cost to capital standpoint. Just tactically and strategically, can you walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about using this cost to capital, whether you referenced quality assets a couple of times, but are there other sectors you can look at, sorry, sub sectors, the type of property size, and then maybe you just overlay how you think about near term accretion versus long-term? John Case : Yeah, we only get to your first one on our cost-to-capital advantage. Real estate discipline and investment wide what\u2019s within our investment parameters? We\u2019ve been asked this question fairly frequently and we are not going to go out and do transactions that we are not comfortable with, just to drive accretion of earnings growth where we think the long-term returns are not going to meet our hurdle rate due to the quality of the investment. So, we are fortunate and that we are seeing plenty of opportunities that need our investment criteria and with our spreads in our distinct cost to capital advantage we are able to drive growth. So when we underwrite properties, we are really we are focusing the IRR and it doesn\u2019t mean a hurdle rate over the long term and we are also looking at what sort of accretion does it produce today, and usually that\u2019s the easiest hurdle. And then the challenging aspect to the underwriting process is getting something that you know and you feel confident about this going to perform over 20 year or 15 year lease term and the percentage I believe, you are going to be have good recapture on that. So that\u2019s how we look at it. Vikram Malhotra : But just in terms of balance sheet, I mean, you could potentially take level down even further there are new asset classes you could think about. I\u2019m just wondering, or is it just it sound like the spread is this an all-time high or have you seen the spreads at other points as well? John Case : Well, as we sit here today this is an all-time high. We\u2019ve reached the levels close to this, I\u2019ll saying since 2011 we\u2019ve been at spreads and we\u2019re substantially higher than our long term average investment spread over our nominal first year weighted average cost to capital. Over the history of a company that they averaged about 145 basis points over the last five years we\u2019ve been more or like 180 basis points to 255 basis points and today they are close to 300 basis points based on our share price. So, the spreads are substantial but we are going to remain disciplined. We could acquire virtually everything we see given our constant capital advantage. But lot of what we see is property, not within our investment perimeter, they\u2019re not let me want to own. As far as the balance sheet goes we\u2019ve remained conservative, we only have we believed in a conservative balance sheet and it has enabled us to write out some difficult recessions over the last 20 years. Most recently the great recession where we were one of the few companies that continue to raise the dividend and that we have to reacquire. So, we are going to committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. Operator : Next we\u2019ll here from Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann. Daniel Donlan : Thank you and good afternoon. I actually have three questions I hope I can get through them very quick. The first question was on the overall recapture rate it was slightly under 92%, I think that\u2019s when it\u2019s comp lowered versus where it has been historically I mean it was kind of all driven by the asset that had a period of vacancy. I know, we are talking our very diminish amount of rent. But we are just of curious if you could kind of give us a little detail and what happened with those five assets is this kind of and if there is anything we can read into that? John Case : Dan, it really comes down to three assets. The 92% releasing spread this quarter as you said it was minimum, was about 3 basis points and lost rent are driven by just these three assets. One was a key seasonable assets it was really leased as a ground leased a best in class QSR quick service restaurant, who then improve the building and ended up dramatically enhancing the real estate value. But we went from leasing land and a building to just leasing land.  So, we had a big you would have to [indiscernible] that will down now there. There were two other assets [indiscernible] concept that accounting for the remaining negative impact on releasing spread action on these three assets the 34 remaining assets would have had a rent recapture rate of 106%. And then of course year-to-date our rent recapture rate is 103%. So until that this is a really a non-issue and certainly not to be any some sort of trend. Daniel Donlan : Okay. And then just had a curiosity, looking at page #25, do you have any way to quality kind of what the recapture rate is or what the retention rate is or your subsequent explorations versus your initial explorations. Is one better than the other and I wanted to follow-up on that too as well. Paul Meurer : Yeah, Dan, it\u2019s Paul I can speak to that a little bit. You may recall some years ago we split out initial explorations versus subsequent to indicate that the subsequent explorations do a lot better because that really is a tenant who\u2019s already made the choice at the end of an initial 15 or 20 year term to clearly stay in that state at that property with us. And as such, there is a slightly higher likelihood that five years later they\u2019re going to make the same decision in stay at that site. So, that was a reason we have broken this out initially. We don\u2019t have any projections that we put on that other than to share with you that when you look into these years and you see that portion of subsequent explorations growing, that should give you some level of comfort relative to the fact that we think we\u2019re going to do quite well with those tenants and probably going to stay at the site have a rental bumps associated with that, et cetera. But that\u2019s why we broke it out a few years back. Operator : Our next question will come from Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors. Tyler Grant : Hello guys. Just two questions from me today to start it off, if you could only invest in one property type which one would it be? So retail, office or industrial, and then on that same note why is 80% of revenue is the right allocation to retail for you guys? John Case : Yeah, well we don\u2019t invest actively in office, in the office that we do has come through portfolio transactions and a couple of relationships we have with major retail tenants who\u2019ve asked us to look at on the leaseback on that headquarters. So we\u2019re not out there actively pursuing that. As far as the difference between retail and industrial if they fit on investment parameters, we don\u2019t have a bias and we\u2019re not trying to target 80% retail. It\u2019s more a function on the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So we\u2019re seeing more retail opportunities within our investment parameters then we are industrial opportunities. But this past quarter industrial picked up a little bit, but given the market and the opportunities available, we\u2019re going to be a predominantly retail net-lease company and whether that number is 80%, 79%, 75% 82%. We can\u2019t tell you because that\u2019s going to be driven by the opportunities we see in the marketplace, beyond [ph] what we are looking for. Tyler Grant : Okay, and then just moving onto the next question. You guys currently have about 2.5% of your revenues that come from AMC the Movie theater operator. Do you think that or how do you think that consolidation within the movie theater category could potentially impact your portfolio and the related cap rates on those assets. John Case : Yeah, I think we\u2019ve been following this closely both their current live discussions as well as their earlier discussions over in Europe. we think consolidation by enlarge is a good thing, IMCE theaters have been performing very well for us, it\u2019s been a very good two years in the theater industry. And we\u2019re seeing good growth there, but we think the efficiencies the size the liquidity didn\u2019t come with this if properly structured and profitably financed certainly would be a positive. Operator : Our next question will come from Nick Joseph of Citi. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. What percentage of tenants give you regular updates on their financial performance? John Case : Our retail tenants, it's about 70%. Nicholas Joseph : And those [ph] who are on annual basis? John Case : Yeah, I mean in some are quarterly, some are semi-annually, some are annually. Nicholas Joseph : Okay. And so how much of your tenant sales grown over the last year? John Case : Our --from the tenant sales growth, I don't think I have got the aggregate number of what their sales growth has been. But our EBIT - our rent coverage ratio, our EBITDAR, not sales, but our EBITDAR ratio is as I mentioned in my remarks 2.7 times on an average. And then the median is 2.6 times, and that's [ph] pre-G&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Next we'll hear from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Paul, just to get into the balance sheet, you've got a bond maturing in September. Just want to get a sense of timing when you\u2019re going to meet that debt maturity. I guess, when can you pay that off, and is it fair to assume maybe a way to tuck in the line of credit balance at that time? Paul Meurer : It matures in mid-September. And Todd, when we get there we'll look at the alternatives we have for refinancing it, whether it be any of the markets we finance in or temporarily putting that on the line. We just have to look at the markets at the time. So it's hard to answer that several months in advance. Todd Stender : Okay. And then when I just look at some of the other coupons and size of the bonds coming due in the next couple of years, when you look at a large balance and a relatively high coupon like 2019. When can you economically make the numbers work to pull something like that forward, make a tender offer or try to retire that. John Case : We\u2019ve looked a lot at this. And Paul, I think, is the right person to address that. Paul Meurer : Yes. And you can imagine Todd, we look at that on a regular basis and kind of have models that we update frequently. That's pretty far out. So you can imagine these make whole provisions that are typically 25 basis point, sometimes 20 basis points built in to most of the bonds that are in the REIT market are there for a reason, they protect the bond investor relative to that yield, and they are pretty owners to overcome. So when you talk about multiple years out it becomes a little bit more challenging in terms of when that will make sense. I think that it will be closer become a little easier, and that's something we do a lot of work on to look at things when they are within more or less 18 to 24 month timeframe and shorter. But out to [ph] 2019, it becomes very difficult. Operator : Our next question comes from Collin Mings of Raymond James. Collin Mings : Hey, good afternoon, guys. John Case : Hey Collin. Collin Mings : Just continuing with the balance sheet, just can you touch on how you\u2019re thinking about preferred equity as part of the capital structure. I think you have about $400 million that\u2019s callable in 2017? John Case : Yes. We have $410 million callable in February of '17. Again, we look at the market and we will consider what the most appropriate refinancing it would be, what type of capital would be, whether it's more preferred debt, equity, something else. We\u2019ll look at all of opportunities. So we\u2019re certainly aware of that and aware that the pricing on that is well above where we could do preferred today. Collin Mings : Right. Just as you sit here today, any bias one way or the other just as we think about modeling that. If you think it's safe to think that you would want to keep preferreds as part of the capital structure, although be it at a lower rate, or just given where your debt costs are, that would be maybe the either way you go. John Case : No. I don\u2019t think we really have a bias today Paul Meurer : No. I think it would be reasonable to model something that is a lower rate if you will, relatively to where that coupon on that preferred currently is. But what type of security is difficult to say. And the one thing, I would point out is relative to FFO projection to the extent that the preferred is called which we haven\u2019t decided that we\u2019re even going to do that, that would obviously impact FFO for next year as well. Operator : And we\u2019ll take a follow up from Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann. Daniel Donlan : Thank you for taking the follow up. Just going back to my question on the subsequent versus initial. I was looking back at your prior expirations and it looks like the subsequent were typically about half of what expired in a given year. And as I look out to 18, 19, 2021, 2022, the bulk of your initial expirations are initial expirations. And I realize that some of these subsequent expirations will re-lease that every five years, but it still looks like the lion's share is going to be close to initial. So the question is, do you think that impacts your recapture rate on a going forward basis, or how are you looking at that? I realize that it's three, four, five years down the line, but it's just John Case : Sumit, you want to take that? Sumit Roy : Yes. Sure, John. So we\u2019ve been talking about this for quite a few quarters now Dan, with every year that goes by our maturity schedules going to come down. And what we haven\u2019t seen is a distinct differential that we can point to as a trend that says on second generation re-leasing we get substantially better re-leasing spread positive re-leasing versus [ph] first generation re-leasing. I think Paul sort of addressed some of it that, yes, what we\u2019ve seen is, if people have exercised an option they will tend to stay there. and most of these options have built in gains or renewal bumps in rent, which could range anywhere between 3% to 5%, and sometimes it\u2019s higher 10%. So it\u2019s a very difficult for us to tell you that hey, the second, third generation assets that are going to be coming due, what is going to be the trend on the renewals on that front. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s - and it\u2019s a fact that with every year, our average renewal rates are going to come down, our re-leasing rates going to come down. Daniel Donlan : Okay. And as far as the weighted average lease term does, it\u2019s at 9.8 years. I mean, is that something given the large numbers in the math, that\u2019s it\u2019s going to be hard to get that back above 10 again unless there's some serious M&A, or is that something you guys think about or is it just as long as you're getting good re-leasing spreads, you're fine with a shorter wall? John Case : Well, we\u2019re certainly pleased with the re-leasing spreads. And it\u2019s just a math, we\u2019ve got a $20 billion plus portfolio of properties, where each year the lease term get shorter by a year, and you're requiring $1.25 billion in 15 years, 16 years. A mature net lease company like ourselves, will have an average lease term that was down unless there is something exceptional that occurs. So we thought about this. This has been happening for a long time now. And we had built out our portfolio management group, which is the largest group within the company, and they've executed more than 2,100 lease rollovers, and we're quite experienced at that. So as the frequency will pick up in future years, we've got a great team in place, and we'll continue to grow that team with the proper talent. Many peers out there with longer lease terms don't even have that department. So here, I'd say one of our most important departments and certainly our largest department. So we've been focused on this for a while, but it's just, as we all say, it's simple math. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Chris Lucas : Hi, good afternoon. Like I see guys, it\u2019s still in the morning. But Just 2 sort of general big picture questions. John, on the acquisitions front, have you seen any change to the competitive landscape that you guys are in as it relates to sources of capital for financing these kinds of transactions? John Case : No, we really haven't. It's the same group of people that we always see. Some other public REITs every now and then, some non-listed REITs, you see the mortgage REITs. There are some private equity funds out there that invest in this sector. And then, there's the institutional capital, that\u2019s run by experienced net lease investment managers. That could be [ph] endowment of pension fund and even sovereign wealth fund money. And they kind of change the higher-quality, higher-rated opportunities. And that hasn't changed. There hasn't been a new group of entrants in terms of competition. Chris Lucas : Okay, great. And then just listening to you talk about some of the capital market situations that you are facing, whether it's the bond or the preferreds, I guess, I'm just wondering, what's sort of your view on interest rates over the sort of next 6 to 12 months? John Case : Wow. One thing I've learned is I'm not very good at predicting interest rates in the future. And I haven't really met many people who are. But as we look at our own business, we want to position it for any interest rate environment. So whether they tick up, whether they continue to stay down or whether they go back down a bit, we want to have a strong balance sheet and a business model that performs well in all of those situations. Personally, there is just so much thirst for yield globally. It's hard for me to see the 10 year moving significantly, even if the Fed does raise Fed funds later this year. I'm not so sure that the influence in the 10 year is not far greater based on what's happening globally and the fund flows that are coming into the U.S. treasury market. Operator : Next, we'll have a follow-up from Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors. Tyler Grant : Hi again, guys. So earlier in the call, it was mentioned that you've never had a year of negative same-store revenue growth. However, if I look at your definition, I believe that it does not include assets that became vacant during the measurement period. So if I were to look at it historically, on average, if you did include assets that went vacant during the period, how much lower would the metric be? Paul Meurer : Tyler, it's Paul. We've done our homework on this topic, because it has come up a few times from you. The answer on average will be about 20 basis points. So when there's a year, where we say 1.3%. If you calculated the way that you calculated relative to vacant properties, it would be about 1.1%. That's our average. Tyler Grant : Okay. That makes sense. And then just to follow up on Dan Donlan's questions regarding just leasing stats. As your portfolio gets older and your lease terms start to shrink, I would imagine in any given year that it's naturally going to mean that you have more lease expires. Is this fair to assume that as your portfolio continues to mature as a result of the more lease expiries that your same-store growth is also going to slow as well? John Case : No it all - Not necessarily. It all - I mean, it all depends on where we're able to draw those re-leasing opportunities and what's happening with market rents and where are the rents on the properties rolling relative to those market rents and our retention rate. So I wouldn\u2019t say it's safe to assume that, that's going to decrease. Operator : And we'll take a follow-up from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Landon Park : This is Landon on for Vikram. Just had a question about the deals that you have sourced so far this year. Can you give us a split between Self-sourced and ones that you've sourced through marketed deals? John Case : Yes. I mean, we're - that's not something that we typically track. I'd say we're getting to sort of the relationship side of the business of what we close. We typically close 80% transactions based on direct relationships we have that we do. That's sort of our long-term average. So I don't know if that answers your question. Landon Park : Has there been a shift one way or the other in that trend? Or it's been very consistent? John Case : It's been pretty consistent. If anything, it's grown a little bit more towards relationship-oriented transactions and sale-leaseback opportunities. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to John Case for any additional and closing comments. John Case : Thanks, April, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. I'm sure we'll be speaking with you in the near-term future, and enjoy the rest of your summer. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2016 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be; John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call; in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. We're pleased to report another active quarter for acquisitions. As announced in yesterday's press release we are increasing in our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $1.25 billion to approximately $1.5 billion; and tightening and raising the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance to $2.87 to $2.89 as we anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. After financing 85% of our capital needs since the start of 2015 with equity, we returned to the bond market this month with a $600 million ten-year senior unsecured bond offering at 3.15% which represents the lowest all-in yield in our company's history for ten-year debt transaction. Our balance sheet remains well capitalized and access to our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to pursue the highest quality net lease investments that support our reliable dividend growth. Now let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks, John. I'm going to provide highlights for few items in our financial statements for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $11 million to $53 million, and year-to-date by $10 million to $171 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we primarily sold common equity and repaid outstanding bonds and mortgages. However, this decrease was also driven by the recognition of a non-cash gain of approximately $2.1 million on interest rates swaps during the quarter which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. And in the comparative third quarter of 2015, we recognized the non-cash loss of approximately $5.2 million that increased our interest expense in that quarter. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of these non-cash gains and losses to calculate our AFFO. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.6% this quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Year-to-date, our G&A is only 4.9% of revenues and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.6% this quarter and we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. Provisions for impairment were $8.8 million in the third quarter on 11 sold properties, five properties held for sale, and two properties held for investment. $2 million of this impairment recognized in the quarter relates to the pending sale of our former headquarters office building in Escondido which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Briefly turning to the balance sheet; we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We raised approximately $500 million of common equity capital thus far this year, and as John mentioned, we successfully returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million ten-year senior unsecured bond offering with the yield of 3.15%. The offering was well oversubscribed and we were very pleased with the quality of the fixed income investors in the offering. This offering extended the weighted average maturity of our senior unsecured bonds from 6.2 to 6.8 years, and provides us with additional flexibility under our $2 billion revolving credit facility which following the offering has a balance of approximately $470 million. Other than our credit facility the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $32.4 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedules remains in very good shape with only $36 million of mortgages coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well latter thereafter with only $284 million of maturing debt in all of 2017. Finally, our overall leverage remains low with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.3 times. In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital; both of which remain well priced financing options today. So let me turn the call now back over to John to give you more background. John Case : Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Our occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, a 30 basis points increase from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our releasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. On the 47 properties we released during the quarter, we recaptured a 105% of the expiring rent. While we typically do not pay tenant improvements to release assets, we did incur $2.1 million NTIs and $7 million in committed redevelopment capital to release three former Sports Authority properties to a leading national retailer while generating a recapture rate of 136% on these three leases, and an incremental yield on invested capital of 18%. Year-to-date, we have recaptured 104% of expiring rent on 122 lease rollovers which remains well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold more than 2,200 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were released. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date. We continue to expect same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 70% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type; all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties released the 247 commercial tenants and 47 different industrials located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There is not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7.3% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. As we discuss our top tenants; I'd like to highlight a positive transaction involving Diageo. Earlier this year, Diageo sold its wine-related businesses in order to exclusively focus on spirits and beer. We own 17 vineyards and wineries in Napa Valley that are leased to Diageo. Diageo sold its operations related to our properties to Treasury Wine Estates, the world's largest publicly traded venture. We and Diageo negotiated a buyout of the guarantee of our leases that have approximately 15 years of remaining term. Diageo was paying Realty Income $75 million in cash in two equal installments in exchange for being released from the guarantee. We received the initial payment in the third quarter and we will receive the second payment in January of 2017. At that time we will fully release Diageo from the guarantee, and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant. We believe this is a very attractive transaction for our shareholders for many reasons including; first, the $75 million payment reduces our investment in prime Napa Valley real estate to approximately 50% of current market value. It also increases our yield on our investment to 10.5%. We gain as a top tenant, Treasury Wine Estates, who is an excellent venture with an equity market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, who has a strong credit profile. While Treasury does not currently have rated public debt, it has a healthy balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.3 times. It has a singular focus on wine with premier labels such Pin Bowl and Barringer [ph], and added BB and Sterling among others through this transaction. Moving on to tenant credit; we continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased from 2.7 times to 2.8 times on a four wall basis and the median increased from 2.6 times to 2.7 times in the third quarter. Moving on acquisitions; we completed $410 million in acquisitions during the quarter and through the first nine months of the year, we completed approximately $1.1 billion in acquisitions at record high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. Year-to-date, we have sourced $23 billion in acquisition opportunities putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.5 billion and we continue to acquire the highest quality net lease properties as we grow our portfolio. Now let me hand it over to Sumit who will discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2016, we invested $410 million in 93 properties located in 29 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. On a revenue basis, 69% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants; 86% of the revenues are generated from retail; and 14% are from industrial. These assets are lease to 23 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drug stores, discount grocery stores, and automotive services. We closed 20 independent transactions in the third quarter and the average investment of property was approximately $4.4 million. Year-to-date 2016, we invested $1.1 billion in 236 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. On a revenue basis 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 81% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 19% are from industrial. These assets are lease to 41 different tenants in 24 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, casual dining restaurants, and transportation services. Of the 61 independent transactions closed year-to-date, two transactions where about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, we sourced approximately $9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $23 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Off these opportunities, 51% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 49% or approximately $11 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the third quarter. Off the $410 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 33% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 23 properties for net proceeds of $18.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.4%. This brings us to 49 properties sold year-to-date for $53.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7%, and an unlevered IRR of 8.6%. Our investment spreads relative to a weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 271 basis points in the third quarter which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less on nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance of 2016 to approximately $1.5 billion. We are also raising our 2016 disposition target to between $75 million and $100 million. With that I'd like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks, Sumit. As mentioned previously, we returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million ten-year benchmark senior unsecured bond offering at a yield-to-maturity at 3.15%. This offering allowed us to term out our loan balance at attractive pricing while repricing our credit curve and the debt capital markets which will have ongoing benefits to the company and future debt offerings. Since the start of 2015 we have issued a total of $2.5 billion of capital. $1.7 billion of this capital raised has been equity, so we have continued to finance our capital needs conservatively. Our leverage remains low with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 23% and debt-to-EBITDA at 5.3 times. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our credit ratings remain BAA1, BBB+ by all three rating agencies with positive outlooks from both, Moody's and S&P providing us with the highest overall credit ratings in the net lease sector. During the third quarter, we increased the dividend for the 88th time in the company's history. The current annual launched dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our year-to-date AFFO payout ratio is 83.5% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had another productive quarter across all functions of the organization and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality properties given our sector leading cost of capital, access to capital, and balance sheet flexibility. At this time I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now go to Robert Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Robert Stevenson : Good afternoon, guys. John, once you get the second payment from Diageo, is there anything left to do really with the vineyard, is that a candidate for sale at some point in '17? John Case : Once we get the second payment in January, Diageo will be fully released and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant as I said. This is prime Napa Valley real estate, and our basis relative to value and investment will be about 50%. It's performing quite well for us, 15 years of lease term left. So it's not something we would look to be selling unless we had an offer that was unbelievably attractive but we'll stick with it. Robert Stevenson : Okay, and then Paul; what were you thinking and how strong the preferred market has been off-late that you guys price a preferred issuance today? What are you thinking about in terms of the series [ph]? Paul Meurer : I think today you'd be looking at something for us in the 5% to -- 5% and 8% range right around there. So that's very attractive from a historical perspective relative to the preferred market. The preferred asset 6% and 8% as you know and it is callable in mid-February, and that's a decision as we get closer to it that we'll make at that time. Operator : At this time we'll move to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joshua Dennerlein : Could you walk us through your thought process on why you didn't provide 2017 guidance with 3Q results? John Case : Sure. Basically we thought by providing it in the first quarter we could provide an additional three months of visibility, and that should resolved in guidance that was -- it is more informed. When we looked at what our peers were doing, we saw that 85% of the S&P500 REITs released guidance in the first quarter or not at all. So again, we were bit of an outlier. This is not unlike us changing the month in which we look at our dividend a couple of years ago, our fifth dividend increases; it used to be in August, now it's in January. So we lined it up with our fiscal year. And in an industry like ours, that -- it's largely reliant on external growth to drive overall growth for the company. It is difficult as you all have seen to project acquisitions 15 months out. And so I think it's especially pertinent to our sector. So that's why we decided to release guidance going forward in the first quarter. Joshua Dennerlein : Got it, thanks. But it looks like you've pulled back on the ATM during the third quarter; any reason for that? And what can we kind of expect for 4Q -- have we used it at all so far? John Case : So over -- with the twelve-month period ending September 30, we exclusively financed our growth with equity and we've raised -- that's $1.1 billion of equity. We've raised $1.7 billion of equity over the last 20 months and our balance sheet has never been in greater shape than it is today with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 22%, 23%; and a debt-to-EBITDA in the low five, about 5.2, 5.3. So we elected to issue the bond that we referenced in our opening comments and for a number of reasons; one, we had not been in the bond market in two years. And we had an opportunity to reset our pricing by issuing a large liquid benchmark ten-year offering. We actually priced six basis points through our secondary spreads when we priced transaction and we had really incredible demand for the transaction as well. So we didn't want to over equitize, we've raised a lot of equity; we'll continue to look at all sources of financing going forward but the bond -- we could not be more pleased with the $600 million unsecured offering and then what that did for us. So we'll continue to look at equity prices going forward, we'll look at all forms of capital we have with the recent bond offering -- near-term, immediate needs for significant capital. Operator : We'll take a question from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. I just wanted to understand the rag [ph] exposure. Now given the size, can you maybe give us a sense of how the portfolio looks like in terms of -- what percent has -- what percent of it has rent bumps? Any other interesting differences between the portfolio you can highlight? John Case : So Vikram, you're talking about the most recent transaction we completed -- it was a\u2026 Vikram Malhotra : Yes, the most recent and then just as the whole -- just as the tenant as a whole. John Case : Okay. So the most recent transaction, we don't go into lot of detail but I will tell you that it was a negotiated off-market transactions sale leaseback opportunity that we worked on with Walgreens directly based on a relationship. Very attractive properties at -- with an appropriate investment structure; the lease does have growth in it. And it was an attractive investment. So it took us to 7.3% in terms of our overall rent exposure. When assuming in the first quarter and Walgreens expects is they've said publicly that the ready transaction will close; we'll be up to around 9% which is at the high end of where we want to be, be it any single tenet, we feel very comfortable that it's such a strong tenant. But again in this -- for the sake of diversity, we'll manage that exposure, back down a bit through additional growth and some selected asset sales but primarily through additional growth. Vikram Malhotra : And can you give us some sense of like what percent of the portfolio has rent bumps. How the -- broadly how the coverage looks in terms of -- even if there is a range you can provide us -- just to give us some sense of the different parts of the portfolio -- the different parts of the world mean portfolio? John Case : Yes, I'd say we have growth on in terms of the Walgreens exposure, it's probably 60% to 70% of the assets. So that's -- there are some that are flat but overall it's about between 60% and 70%. And it's all sale back transactions, not that lease existing transactions. Operator : And we'll take next question from Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities. Vineet Khanna : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. So just on the disposition side, it looks like on a property count basis, 82% of disposition have been vacant properties in '16, 73% in '15 and 35% in 2014. But it just reflects sort of a shift in strategy around dispositions and asset management or as you just said, reflection of tenant fallout here or something like that. John Case : Well, we're selling more vacant assets that we think we're better-off selling and trying to relax. So we're being more active on that front. And this past year we had two bankruptcy events that we were planning for; that included Ryan's and the Sports Authority, and some of the sales activity had been related to vacant properties for those former tenants, end tenants. Vineet Khanna : Okay. So no real shift in strategy just sort of a thought. John Case : Yes, and we'll be a little more active on the disposition front. We are raising our disposition guidance from 50 to 75 for the year, to $75 million to $100 million for the year. And again, we're -- if we have legacy assets that are not consistent with our investment parameters today, we're going to strongly consider selling those assets; some of which are leased but some of which are not leased; and redeploying that capital into assets that better fit our investment strategy and provide our shareholders with a better return. Operator : At this time we'll go to Nick Joseph with Citi Group. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. Paul, you mentioned the $470 million on the line after the recent debt deals. So I'm wondering how you think about the line and floating rate debt more broadly as part of the capital structure? Paul Meurer : Historically, once we reached some critical level of borrowings on the line that would be the immediate way to finance the business and finance acquisitions. We then look to the permanent capital markets, mostly equity but also long-term bonds etcetera. But historically aligned with a lot smaller too, so over the past year with a $2 billion line, it gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to carry a little bit larger balance than we had historically; but on a percentage basis relative to the enterprise as a whole, it's quite similar. So we're not taking on that much more variable rate debt overall in the capital structure. What's good about that -- the ability to carry a $400 million, $500 million, $600 million balance on the line but again isn't taking that much more risk relative to the enterprise as a whole, it gives you almost a free look at the permanent capital markets where you can wait and time when it's appropriate to issue long-term bonds or perhaps common equity. So that's one side benefit of that. Right now sitting here with plus or minus $500 million balance, that kind of gives us that window but it's not one where we're anxious or you know feel the need to immediately issue capital any time soon? Nicholas Joseph : Thanks for that. And then I guess in terms of cap rates, have you see any changes to cap rates or seller's appetites more broadly, given the economic environment and move -- rates the election or anything else? John Case : No, cap rates have remained pretty consistent over the last 12 to 15 months. On the investment grade side we're still seeing initial yields in the low fives to the high six's on the non-investment grade side; I'd say the high-five's up into the 8% range. So that's been consistent and it really no reaction in the market to the movement and the tenure at this joint \u2013 juncture. Operator : [Indiscernible] has the next question with Mizuho. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. I see that your floating rate debt exposure, basically a credit line it was about 20% in the quarter dropping down to about 14%, 15% post the bond issued in October. The question is, given the concern about rising rates is that a level you're comfortable with or should we look for further reduction? And then how you're thinking overall about floating rate exposure at this point in the cycle with rates slightly [ph]? John Case : So I'll start and Paul, you can elaborate. I think on a $23 billion capital structure, $500 million of floating rate debt is something we're quite comfortable with. So we will have some floating rate outstanding. I mean we're not in the business predicting where interest rates are going to go, I know a year ago people were predicting it would go higher and well, actually -- even after today, well below where they were in December of last year. So that's a pretty dangerous game, I think a lot of us have been expecting -- a lot of people in the marketplace have been expecting rates now to rise for five years after the monetization that took place after the Great Recession. But that really hasn't materialized, we've got 1% plus GDP growth; our tenants are doing well but when we look at their P&Ls, we're not seeing gangbuster growth, we're just seeing moderate solid sales growth. So we're certainly comfortable, gets back to the amount of floating rate debt with $500 million. I mean we're not going to put all of our chips in one interest rate scenario, and we'll remain lowly leverage, very strong balance sheet where the impact of rates will be muted on our own company. Paul, anything you want to add to that? Paul Meurer : No, that's fine. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then if I may, as a follow-up, just -- I know you are giving 2017 guidance but just curious on the competitive environment for the types of acquisitions you're looking at the higher grade type of tenant. Just curious on the competitive environment that you're seeing out there, institutional bids etcetera? John Case : Sure. There is some level of competition but we're really in a good position to focus on the highest quality net lease properties given our significant cost of capital advantage, size, access to capital, balance sheet flexibility. So we remain very selective and that's been consistent. Going back to probably 2010 we acquired on average about 5% of what we're sourcing. So we're in a position where if we want it, we can generally execute and make the acquisition. So there is competition out there but seldom are we competing with other public companies for transactions, there are some private capital out there and certainly on the higher quality industrial product -- we'll run into some money being managed by investment managers, familiar with the net lease market and that could be pension fund and down and even sovereign wealth money. Not seen much out of the private or non-listed REITs today and really/only compete with maybe one or two other public companies; just on the assets. And then again, that's just given where we're focused versus where some of our peers are focused on the yield risk curve. Operator : At this time we'll move to RJ [ph] with Baird. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon, guys. Paul, couple of questions for you on the balance sheet; so obviously you guys are discussing how much equity you guys have issued over the past twelve months, and I'm curious how comfortable or what level of leverage you're comfortable bringing the balance sheet up to -- if you choose not to issue additional equity in the next couple of quarters? Paul Meurer : As a general remark, and we will -- we've stated our philosophy for the balance sheet is kind of roughly two-thirds equity, one-third long-term debt if you will to kind of help people think about how to model us going forward. When equity has been attractively priced as it's been over the past year and a half, we lean more towards doing that, and really exclusively did that for 21/22 months. And as such that brought it down to more or less say 20% debt leverage ratio, but ultimately you want to have the ability to go out more to that 30% to 35% range if you need to -- and if equity for some reason at different points in time is not as attractively priced as it is. But we're very comfortable with where we are right now in that 20% to 25% range. We'd be comfortable going up a little bit higher and have the ability and flexibility to use debt or equity going forward right now. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And Paul, I priced obviously a good ten-year bond offering last quarter, 3.15; I'm curious if you're talking to your bankers, if you think -- where do you think that deal will get pressed today? Paul Meurer : Right now that same bond is trading at about 137 basis points over. The deal was priced at 147 basis points, so even with the rise in treasuries we're still looking at ten-year money kind of around the same effective yield that we were able to do the transaction a few weeks ago. Operator : We'll now move along to Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Hi, good afternoon. Investment spreads were 271 basis points this quarter, given that changes in cap rates often times lag changes in the capital markets, where would the spreads need to fall to that would cause you to get more conservative on your investments? John Case : Karin, over the history of the company, our investment spreads versus our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital have been in the mid-100s. So we've gone as high as 275 basis points which is a record and we've been as low as 75 basis points. It all depends on the growth in assets, I mean we're not just simply looking at the spreads, we certainly want transactions to be accretive but we're also looking at the long-term benefits for the IRR, the growth and the lease. So even we have at least 100 basis points of cushion today before we even hit our average investments spread. So we're in good shape on that front. Karin Ford : Thanks for that. A second question, was the bond offering anticipated in original guidance? And recognizing that you're not giving 2017 guidance today, do you have any early thoughts as to how AFFO growth maybe setting up for next year compared to this year? John Case : Well, we don't want to bring it out, guidance -- we feel very good about the business and are seeing very good opportunities going forward. So we do like -- we have a great deal of momentum going into 2017 and it's going to be a good year for the company. But we'll come out as I said and issue formal guidance during the first quarter. And on the bonds; Paul, do you want to address that? Paul Meurer : We're just in terms of what we expected coming into this year. We did model doing a little bit more leverage and not just all equity, up through the third quarter. And the leverage that we modeled in fact was a little bit wider pricing, we were thrilled with what we're able to execute a few weeks ago. So given the uptick in acquisition activity throughout the year, and the fact that we're now expecting $1.5 billion; had we financed that with rather than 100% equity, financed it with two-thirds equity, one-third debt; we would have come in above our original guidance by a material amount. But what we did is took advantage of attractive equity cost and really fortify the balance sheet; and here today we sit in great shape and as Paul said, we have the flexibility to look at all forms of capital, long-term, as we look at financing the business on a go-forward basis in 2017. Operator : We'll then move to Daniel Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Daniel Donlan : Thank you. Just wanted to talk about your EBITDA coverage, it was only 2.6 times in the fourth quarter of '15, now it's 2.8. So is that more a function of what you bought or is it more a function of your tenants, your existing tenants gauged wrong. Paul Meurer : It's either dark growing with our existing tenants for the most part. And I think acquisitions contributed a little bit to that but you know the uptick in this last quarter -- couple of industries, see stores and our tire, auto service. I'll head we saw a good growth in the EBITDAR from all those industries and they were the principal industries that contributed to the increase and are -- both our average and our median EBITDAR coverage ratios. Daniel Donlan : I appreciate that. And just kind of curious on cap rates and neither if their lease back, basically lease back this quarter -- basically lease back this quarter. What do you think the difference in cap rates is for deals that are maybe ten-years in term versus maybe 15 or even 20-years in term? Is there a pretty big gap there? Just kind of curious on your thoughts. John Case : There is a gap and I'll hand it over to Sumit. Sumit, you want to take that one? Sumit Roy : Yes, sure. So it's a function of both, the tenant as well as the lease term. And if you assume that the leases are structured exactly identical and the only delta is going to be the term, I would say between a 10-year and a 20-year lease term, you could potentially have a difference of anywhere between 10 to 25 basis points. John Case : And we've seen it even as high as 50 in one transaction. Sumit Roy : If the credit is non-investment grade, yes. Operator : We will now move to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Thanks, guys. It seems like the notion of you guys making large M&A type deals -- that's kind of been taken off the table, we just haven't seen many transformational deals in the net lease space. Can you just comment on how that market looks like right now; you've got year-end coming, investors and portfolio managers have tax deadline. How does the M&A market look like right now? John Case : The M&A market has been pretty slow as of -- observed it across the sectors. We're not going to -- I'm not in a position to speculate on what may or may not happen in our own sector. So I don't want to make any comments around that. Todd Stender : Sure. And then maybe just going back to kind of the -- the lease renewals; if you take the redevelopment out with the Sports Authority assets, it looks like renewals ruled down by about 8%, if I have that right. Is there anything in there -- any tenants or leases that rolled down the most? Anything -- any color you can provide? John Case : If you look at the last column, released to a tenant after a period of vacancy on Page 24 of our supplement. We had three of those six tenants where we had recapture rate of 54%, where former Ryan's that were leased to national tenants. And even though the rent was substantially less, we substantially increased the value of those investments by leasing them to national high quality tenants, long-term lease terms with good growth. So we got a much lower cap rate, in one instance it was done as a ground lease, and we got a completely new building that would revert to us at the end of the term if this tenant elects to move on. So there is a story behind all of these; if you were to exclude those three former Ryan's, the recapture rate would have been 102% versus the way you calculated it at about 93%, 94%. We still think the right number is 105% and -- including the assets that we released without vacancy. We had an excellent return on our invested capital there and we can get 18% on an unlevered basis for our shareholders, we will do that all day long. Operator : We'll take the final question today from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Collin Mings : Thanks, yes, good afternoon. Just sticking with that Page 24, just -- can you expand just on the types of opportunities you're seeing as far as redevelopment, obviously this quarter was a bit unusual in terms of Sports Authority but is there a way to think about how much you could or would spend, given some of the incremental yield opportunities? Sumit Roy : Yes, so one of the things that we've been talking about now for quite a while is our focus on asset management and we've had a very focused effort in trying to identify opportunities, not only when it comes to releasing assets but even with existing assets, out parcel developments; do my seeing existing assets, having direct conversations with tenants to figure out if they need is for the 100% of the assets or it could be better served in by taking back some of the asset and re-tenanting it. All those discussions have sort of started to finally bear fruition and that's sort of the reason why you're starting to see 105%, 106%, 110% returns. We current are looking at 31 different opportunities within our portfolio and these are just immediate opportunities which should play out over the next twelve-months. And some of the returns that John just mentioned is around the zip codes of what we are expecting on some of these opportunities and this is going to continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business and one of the growth drivers that we are very excited about. Collin Mings : Okay. And then just -- maybe can you quantify that just in terms of dollars and how do you balance that opportunity versus some of the messaging as far as wind or rash it up some disposition activity as well? Sumit Roy : I mean disposition is different, in my mind from our asset management opportunities -- pure asset management that I was referencing, part of the reason why we've increased our disposition is to take advantage of the market that we have today by another $25 million. Quantifying this asset management, it continues to change; you continue to find new opportunities. So I think I'd be premature in putting a dollar amount to it but I can certainly share with you that the returns that we're looking at are in the high teens. John Case : And I'll add to that, that we expect as Sumit said to become an increasing component of our business as we more actively manage the portfolio and just to remind you the dispositions are almost exclusively non-strategic assets; they are being sold-off our list which remains right at about 1%. So it's a kind of two different concepts there. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. John Case : Thanks Matt, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again, and I'm sure we'll see most, if not all of you at May REIT. So have a good afternoon and thanks for being on our call. Operator : And again, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.",

Morgan Vineet Khanna - Capital One Securities Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors Joshua Dennerlein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Good morning and welcome to the VEREIT 2016 Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Bonni Rosen : Thank you. Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2016 fourth quarter and yearend earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 12 :00 PM Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529, with a confirmation code of 10099562. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings and business update call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT\u2019s actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Annual Report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today\u2019s call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly and yearend financial results. Glenn will then discuss 2017 guidance and highlights of our diversified portfolio. We will conclude today\u2019s call by opening the line for questions. Glenn? Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, Bonni. And thanks for joining our call today. In 2016 we substantially achieved the core components of our business plan that we outlined in August, 2015 and in certain areas exceeded expectations. Let me begin by highlighting a few accomplishments. As AFFO per diluted share for the year was $0.78 within our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.78. We completed $1.14 billion of dispositions were totaled nearly $2.6 billion since 2015, exceeding the top end of our original guidance by $400 million. Our balance sheet is stronger reflected by a reduction in our net debt to normalized EBITDA to 5.7 times better than the projected range of 6 to 7 and we received investment grade rating on our debt from both S&P and Fitch. Cole Capital finished the year ranked number four for non-listed REIT capital raise up from 13 in 2015. These achievements allowed us to go on the offense during the fourth quarter acquiring $80 million of assets on a leverage neutral basis. We\u2019re pleased with our operations for the year with occupancy ending at 98.3% same store rent was up 0.1% reduced from 0.8% due to the impact of the Ovation bankruptcy. In 2016, we had 4.9 million square feet of leasing activity of which 3.6 million square feet were early renewals with tenants including T-Mobile, Abbott Labs, Del Monte and Netflix. The remaining 1.3 million square feet were 2016 vacancies or expirations. Of the early renewals, we recaptured 96% of the prior rents which will have a short-term effect on same store, for the 2016 vacancy and expirations we captured 99% of prior rent. Approximately 75% of this leasing activity was office and industrial. Our portfolio diversification was further enhanced as we implemented our calling process. At year end property type diversification was 62.6% retail, 15.6% industrial and 21.8% office. We continue to focus on our goal of reducing office exposure below 20%. Additionally our exposure to Red Lobster declined to 8.2% and we\u2019ll continue to disposition process. Our top 10 tenants represent 30.2% which is among the lowest concentration in the industry. $395 million of assets were sold in the fourth quarter bringing the total for 2016 to $1.14 billion and an average cash cap rate of 6.9%. This surpassed the high end of our $800 million to $1 billion guidance range for the year and is an addition to the $1.4 billion of asset sales in 2015. During the past few years we\u2019ve made significant progress with strategic dispositions primarily across our targeted categories. $123 million of retail joint ventures, $681 million of flat lease properties, $674 million of Red Lobster sales, $725 million of office properties and $325 million of non-core assets. With our balance sheet metrics inline we\u2019ve been recycling assets and creating internal capital to fortifying diversify the portfolio through retail and industrial acquisitions. Our retail focus is on the off price sector including traditional and specially grocers, Select Sporting Goods UDA\u2019s [ph] Furniture, pet supplies, arts and craft, home improvement and fitness. For instance during the quarter, we acquired seven properties which included tenants in the above categories. Our industrial focus is on location, physical functionality and appropriate tendencies represented by the Best Buy distribution center we acquired last week. During the fourth quarter Cole Capital raised $67.5 million of new equity an average of $22.5 million a month. For the year the Cole REIT\u2019s rate $487 million just below our $500 million guidance in a year when the industry\u2019s projected capital rate was down nearly 55%. Cole was able to increase its market share to 10.8% resulting in a number for yearend sponsor ranking according to Stanger. New equity for January was $21 million which continues to reflect the initial ramp up of CCIP/3. Cole made significant progress on the broker-dealer front in 2016 and into early 2017 signing any new product selling agreements including 16 for CCIP/3. Additionally to Tara Financial Group which was a top three producer in 2014 recently began selling Cole products. Before Mike reviews our financial results let me provide a brief update on litigation. The court held the status conference in January during which resolving number of outstanding issues related to document production and set a schedule for the parties to file briefs addressing the issue of class certification. A following conference is scheduled with the court on May 16. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-K filed today. Let me now turn over the call to Mike. Mike Bartolotta : Thanks Glenn and thank you all for joining us today. We finished the year end on plan achieving AFFO of $0.78 per diluted share with $0.17 coming from the fourth quarter. During the quarter consolidated revenue was $351.9 million slightly below Q3 revenue of $362.9 million as we continue to successfully implement our disposition program. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $118.2 million versus net income of $30.2 million for the third quarter representing a difference of $148.4 million. However included in Q4 net loss was a number of non-operational charges including $120.9 million of Cole Capital goodwill impairment charge, $10.2 million relating to the increase write-off of program development cost and $5.2 million of compensation related charges, all of which resulted from a slower than originally anticipated capital raise for Cole this year. In addition, as we noted in our last call in Q3 we had a net gain on the disposition of property sold for that quarter of $28.1 million whereas in Q4, property sold resulted in a minor loss of $0.2 million or negative quarter-to-quarter charge of $28.3 million. It should be noted that for the full year 2016 the gain of disposition real estate sold and held for sale assets is $45.5 million. Lastly both Q4 tax expense and interest expense were more favorable than Q3 by $6.7 million and $5.3 million respectively. If you were to adjust all of these items, you will see a positive net income essentially the same as Q3. Well Cole has done a good job re-establishing its brand and raising capital. The industry environment has been difficult to predict leading us to reduce projections, which resulted in the 2016 goodwill impairment charge. FFO per diluted share for the fourth quarter was $0.05 as compared to $0.19 for the third quarter due to slightly lower revenue, the goodwill impairment charge. The increase in program development cost write-off just discussed and the dilutive effects of our recent equity offering at August. AFFO was $0.17 per diluted share as compared to $0.20 for the third quarter primarily due to slightly lower revenue, the reversal of $9.2 million tax benefit received last quarter driven by the closing of CCIP/2\u2019s offering. The increase write-off for the development cost along with some unusual charges including in G&A which we\u2019ll discuss net, partially offset by reduced interest expense. G&A for the quarter was $44.4 million versus $29.8 million in the third quarter representing an increase of $14.6 million, due primarily to the $15.4 million of non-operational items previously noted. Real estate G&A was $13.3 million for the quarter up $1.2 million from the $12.1 million in the prior quarter mostly due to normal year end activity. Cole Capital G&A was $31.1 million up $13.4 million from $17.7 million in Q3 primarily due to the $10.1 million increased write-off for the development cost and the $5.2 million of compensation related charges. Recurring CapEx was $16.6 million for the year which was lower than our anticipated range of $20 million to $25 million. In part some of that capital spend will occur in 2017 and an additional amount will fall into the year due to the lease renewals that Glenn mentioned earlier. Given these factors our 2007 estimate for recurring CapEx was $30 million to $35 million which during the two year period with average approximately $20 million to $25 million. Cost related to the matters arising from the audit committee investigation which are included in litigation, merger and other non-routine cost were approximately $10.8 million for the quarter. This brings the total legal cost related to these matters to $24.2 million for the year excluding any insurance proceeds which was lower than our last guidance range of $30 million to $35 million. Our estimate for 2017 gross legal cost is $45 million to $50 million excluding any insurance proceeds. Turning to our fourth quarter real estate activity, we sold 78 properties for $394.9 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.4% and a pre-goodwill allocation gain of $17.7 million which is reduced to a loss of approximately by $1 million after goodwill. Subsequent to the quarter the company disposed of 19 properties for an aggregate sales price of $62.3 million. Additionally during the fourth quarter the company acquired seven properties for $80.2 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.7%. During 2016 the company acquired eight properties for approximately $100.2 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.8%. Subsequent to the quarter the company acquired one property for $46 million in addition, we purchased the fee interest in three properties for $20.2 million in which we already own the leaseholds. As of 12/31 our net debt to EBITDA remained at 5.7 times same as last quarter, our fixed charge coverage ratio was a healthy 2.9 times and our net debt to gross real estate investment ratio was just under 40%. Our unencumbered asset ratio was 66% and that our weighted average duration of our debt was 4.4 years. We had $420.2 million of first mortgages and other secure debt coming due in 2017 of which $125.4 million was repaid during 2016. As a remainder comes due, we will use available cash flow in our revolving line of credit and expect to eventually term out the new exposures with unsecured debt. And as a reminder, we have essentially no floating debt. During 2016, we significantly transformed our capital structure and put ourselves in a safe and stable position going forward. We\u2019ve brought our net debt down from $8 billion to $6.1 billion, we decrease the net debt to EBITDA from 7 times to 5.7 times. We issued $1 billion of unsecured senior notes and $702.5 million of equity to prepay the bonds that were expiring at February of 2017 and partially pay down our term loan as well. We lengthened our debt duration and created a well-staggered maturity schedule. We increased our liquidity and we now have full capacity on our revolving line of credit of $2.3 billion and we established a continuous equity program or ATM with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $250 million available through September 2019. These accomplishments along with the overall implementation of the business plan resulted in investment grade rating much sooner than originally anticipated. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Glenn. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, Mike. Let me turn to guidance for 2017. The AFFO per share between $0.70 and $0.73 which includes to $0.02 to $0.03 for Cole Capital. Dispositions and acquisitions each totaling $450 million to $600 million at cap rates ranging from 6.5 to 7.5 with dispositions more front end loaded and acquisitions back end loaded. Net debt to EBITDA in the target range of 5.7 to 6.0 real estate operations with average occupancy approximating 98% and same store rental growth approximating 0.5%. Cole Capital equity raised between $400 million and $500 million and $800 million to being of acquisitions on behalf of the Cole REITs. Diversification is one of our portfolios core attributes and we\u2019ll continue strengthening it through the year. At approximately 63%, retailers are largest property types which includes restaurants at 24%, excluding restaurants retail has six of our top 10 tenants as well as highest occupancy at 99.7%. The largest retail component discount at 7.8% and exposures concentrated in family dollar general and also includes Wal-Mart and T.J. Maxx. Pharmacy comprise of 7.2% as primarily Walgreens and CBS. Grocery is 4.9% and our exposure includes average Albertsons, Kroger, Publix and Stop and Shop. Home and garden is 4.4% with the largest tenants being Tractor Supply, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s. The other retail sectors are approximately 2% or less. As you can see our retail has strong credits 47% of income from investment grade tenants. The past year we\u2019ve seen a number of retailer issues some financial other structural. Focusing on those, let\u2019s look at what\u2019s not in our portfolio. Traditional department stores, such as Penny, Macy\u2019s and Sears. We do have Cole\u2019s which is investment grade and is less than 1%. In apparel we have no exposure to [indiscernible] Limited or American Eagle and [technical difficulty] With regards to sporting goods our portfolio does not include Sports Authority or Eastern Mountain Sports Stores and we have only one Gander Mountain. We look at electronics which is less than 1% our primary tenant is investment grade rated Best Buy. Combined hhgregg and KANs are only 0.3%. Casual dining comprises 15.6% of the portfolio. We have many major tenants in that roster. Red Lobster which has performed well represents 8.2% of the remainder Applebee\u2019s is next at 1.6%. We also have brand name such as Olive Garden, Cracker Barrel and Outback all under 1%. Nearly 100% of our restaurant leases are triple net more than 90% have contractual rental growth and the average lease term is 14 years. We have provided an update on occupancy cost for retail and restaurant tenants and are supplemental and you\u2019ll see they are well within the range of affordability. As we\u2019ve outlined today, our focus on VEREIT is provide a safe balance sheet with a stable diversified and growing portfolio. We believe this is an attractive proposition for a reasonable portion of the real estate investment market. We will continue to monitor the economic environment and make sure we\u2019re on the right course, but our foundation and strategy are both solidly in place. In closing, on behalf of the board I would like to thank Bruce Frank for his instrumental role and contributions to the company and we\u2019re pleased to welcome Mary Hogan Preusse and Richard Lieb to the board. With that, I\u2019ll open the call for further questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and the first question comes from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Andrew Rosivach : Thanks for your comment on retail. There\u2019s a rumor that you know a lot about the industry. I\u2019m just curious we\u2019ve always had in net lease this kind of bias of lower cap rates and lower exposure to retail is potentially being positive, one of your own goals is to reduce the office exposure. I\u2019m just curious given the pressures that we were having in the industry could that potentially change especially what you guys are looking and doing on the buy side. Glenn Rufrano : It\u2019s a real good question Andy. In many meetings I\u2019ve been asked about the three property types and I\u2019ve had and I\u2019m going to call some younger people come in say, isn\u2019t office at a favor today and retail is in favor and my answer is generally been, that may be right today, but if you were older like I am, you\u2019d realize that at times offices in favor and out of favor, industrial is in favour and out of favor and retail is in favor and out of favor. We\u2019re moving in one of those directions as we speak. We clearly had a bit more retailers problems and rightfully so caused by the internet and we\u2019re seeing some structural changes and also some financial changes, but that\u2019s natural it\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m not sure any of us is smarter enough to know over the long periods of time which of these sectors will be in favor and out of favor. But I do know if we diversify and we have good real estate in those sector we have a better, stronger portfolio. To your point I think, on retail we did spend some more time on retail because of what has been going on in the business and I have been let time it in and it\u2019s very important to understand our credits. So as a simple answer, Andy we think that three property types in proportion that we have make sense. We\u2019re not smart enough to know in any given time what\u2019s in favor, not in favor but if we have good fundamental real estate and good diversification we will have a long-term stable portfolio. Andrew Rosivach : Understood and just as a follow-up, within that lease is - are broader concerns about retail starting to get priced in higher retail cap rates? Glenn Rufrano : They maybe, although I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen them yet. I think the quality differences are very important in that equation. I personally still would believe in high quality retail or some old shopping center or single tenant and if the market booked at that way, I don\u2019t think there will be much difference. What I do believe is happening is that if you start talking and be in certainly C levels, there is a large divergence than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Andrew Rosivach : Got it, thank you sir. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : As you look to do acquisitions in 2017, where do you see the best values right now, where do you see the most compelling buys, whether it\u2019s investment grade, non-investment grade, property type or certain type of tenant industry? Glenn Rufrano : Well Anthony, if we break down our thoughts on acquisitions because we\u2019re lightning up in office. We will not be in the acquisition mode, certainly we\u2019re in - for office now and our restaurant exposure certainly in dining mostly because the Red Lobster puts into position where we would not - for diversification purposes be buying restaurant. So if we eliminate those we\u2019re back to retail in many of the areas that I just talked about and industrial. If I stayed with industrial we did purchase just close last week, at 1 million square foot Best Buy industrial distribution plant North of Columbus at 7.1 cap rate and we believe we can find some industrial although hard, which can provide value. There we have to look to credit, but also the physical nature of the plant and location. If we can find the right fundamentals we believe there are some value in industrial although it\u2019s not going to be easy to find. In the retail front, as we just talked about we\u2019re in the off price sector, we\u2019re in the necessity shopping sector and we do believe there\u2019s some retail that couple provide value. It could be in primary or secondary markets as long as the credit in the demographic fit the merchandising of the tenant. So we\u2019re going to be as concerned about whether that tenant can merchandise properly to the demographics as we all are, whether it\u2019s a primary market or a secondary market and in those categories that I went through you\u2019re starting with grocer and Select Sports has beauty and so forth, we do believe there is some value in there that we can take advantage of especially with the acquisitions arms that we have and have had over the years, where we believe we have very good ability to look at the market and integrate. For instance let me just update part of your question, can you access the market? We have $21.6 billion of opportunities in 2016 brought to us, we closed $760 million. With those opportunities and the categories we see, we do believe we can find value. Anthony Paolone : Okay, thanks and then in guidance. Is there much contemplated as it relates to the balance sheet. I don\u2019t know if you have lot to do this year, but would anything - now that you assume there. Mike Bartolotta : No I mean, the balance sheet in 2017 Anthony, its Mike. We don\u2019t have about little less than $300 million of mortgages that are going to turn and we\u2019ll put those mortgages as they turn onto our line and eventually, when we have the right size number we\u2019ll take out in a unsecured bond. So we will start to look at, we have some converts that are coming due in February of 18, so we will start to look at those potentially some time later in the year and we also have about $500 million of our term debt that converts in 18, but has a one-year extension. So I think what we have right now is some optionality [ph] to look at some things a little bit longer out than one-year and we will be looking at them. But we can act or not act depending on what the market does. Anthony Paolone : Okay, thanks and then, last couple questions on Cole. I need to get to your capital raising goals it\u2019s almost doubling the pace you guys saw in January. How comfortable are you with that? Like what kind of gives you comfort on that front? Glenn Rufrano : Well in part, Anthony we don\u2019t have CCIP/3 on track yet and we do expect that will come on, as I mentioned, we had 16 new selling agreements for CCIP/3 that just came on at the end of the last year, so they sure start picking this up this year. We also are excited about having Cetera back on. Cetera has over 7,000 advisors and when they were in the top three with Cole in 2014, it has been a great platform for us and they just came on, we actually sold our first product with them two days ago. So the culmination of CCIP/3 Cetera and we\u2019re continuing to work with some of the larger broker-dealer platforms. Would give us some comfort we can increase throughput through this year - variable is the market and we don\u2019t forget about that. Stanger is projecting $5.8 billion this year from the $4.5 billion last year. Blackstone has a good part of that, but there is some increase expected. Some increase in the market, some increase in our advisors coming on and CCIP/3 gives us some comfort that we can reach those goals. Anthony Paolone : Okay thanks and then just last one on Cole. Longer term any change in terms of how you think about that business fitting in, with the rest of the company especially you mentioned Blackstone it seems like others would like to be in that space overtime. Does it make you change your thoughts on where to go with the business? Glenn Rufrano : We continue to start with, let\u2019s make it as valuable as possible and we\u2019re making some good headway there. I wish the market was better. When you have a better oiled machine in a better market, it\u2019s easier to make a decision on value and whether or not it\u2019s value to the public company in its stock price, is adequate. We think we have a little more room in 2017 to improve Cole especially by bringing some larger platforms. We may be in a position later on or at some point this year to understand how the public market is valuing yet relative to us, which will be a very important element in terms of, how we see ourselves long-term. Anthony Paolone : Okay, great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our last question is from Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead. Vineet Khanna : Glenn just going on that line of thought for Cole. Can you talk about - Blackstone is obviously going through the wirehouse is that something that would be of interest to Cole as you sort of look to expand? Glenn Rufrano : It certainly would be, but what Blackstone has done is been really very good, we hope for the whole industry having the wirehouses sell their product, we would like to piggyback on that very frankly, that would be very good for us and we continue to work with the wirehouses as we do the larger broker-dealers to help us sell more product overtime. Vineet Khanna : Okay and then just on last one on Cole here. Just have you seen any impacts sort of from the uncertainty that\u2019s come up around the fiduciary rule, I mean clearly you were able to bring Cetera on forward, but have there any other sort of issues with the broker-dealers as a result of questions around the fiduciary rule? Glenn Rufrano : I think we\u2019d all agree that fiduciary rule is a good thing, people should be fiduciaries. The problem has been the definition of the fiduciary. What has been happening is, in light of poor definition in my view from the deal on that. The broker-dealer themselves have been creating definitions that they believe work and that\u2019s going to be very helpful this year. For instance, if you have INEP product with no commission that\u2019s an easy choice, but T shares under certain circumstances now are being considered applicable to that rule, so it\u2019s working its way through the system as we speak larger companies have come up with their own internal proposals on how to meet that rule and as those decisions get made, it will help us move forward in 2017. Vineet Khanna : Okay great and then just shifting to sort of the real estate side of things. On the acquisition front in 2017, is there any build-to-suit contemplated, I mean you\u2019ve got sort of the cap lease stuff that you guys acquired long ago, is that something that\u2019s sort of under consideration at this point. Glenn Rufrano : I\u2019m sorry, did you say disposition or acquisition? Vineet Khanna : Acquisition, as it pertains to sort of build-to-suit. Glenn Rufrano : I see. We have been looking at a number build-to-suits, especially in the industrial area. Internally we have a - it\u2019s a small construction group, so that we can monitor construction overtime and we can be pure takeout from a construction loan or we could actually fund along the way and with our internal group and perhaps an outside consultant. Make sure, we\u2019re funding adequately for the ultimate takeout. As I speak to Paul and Tom about those that business, we can see that build-to-suit is a 50 basis point in many cases increase over a normal cap rate and if we can minimize the risk to get there it\u2019s a very good way for us to move forward and we\u2019re looking at number of those transactions right now. Vineet Khanna : Okay great and then just last from me, thanks for the update on the sort of the litigation. What are the prospects for settlement before the May meeting date? Glenn Rufrano : We have our General Counsel in the room, who\u2019s - can\u2019t give an answer. I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m sorry Vineet it\u2019s one of those things, I\u2019d have to kill, if I knew. So realistically it\u2019s and I don\u2019t mean to make joke of it, it\u2019s very important but it\u2019s not something that we can have a discussion on. Vineet Khanna : Okay, well I appreciate the consideration and thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Michael Knott : Just question for you on your anticipated acquisition, disposition guidance number for 2017. Just curious if you feel like those are light particularly on one side or the other and then maybe can you just give a little bit more color on your comment on the front end loaded and back end loaded with respect to those and the thought process behind that? Glenn Rufrano : Sure. I\u2019ll start with dispositions. We\u2019re just - as we\u2019ve been focused on dispositions Michael as you know, the dispositions that we\u2019re targeting in 2017 are office to get that 20% below number and Red Lobster so it\u2019s a very focused approach with those two and we will always have some non-core that we believe putting capital into would not make sense. So we\u2019ll have those category, so it\u2019s very specific and we feel pretty good about the numbers, the 450 to 600 surrounding those specific categories. In terms of acquisitions and I think we\u2019ve had this conversation in 17 years as a CEO I\u2019ve never given acquisition guidance. But in our business which is very acquisition-oriented that didn\u2019t seem to make much sense. So we spent a good amount of time looking at our acquisition, you see we had some acquisitions to-date and looking at our pipeline and where we are in terms of letters of intent and so forth and so we felt, we should come up with a number that made sense and we think the 450 to 600 make sense, could it be more, if we find appropriate acquisitions it could be more, but we never want to be put in a box. Just like we\u2019re a fund that have three years to invest and if you don\u2019t invest the money you\u2019ll lose it, we don\u2019t want to be that. We\u2019re not a fund that have to invest. We\u2019re public company that invests widely for their shareholders and we\u2019re going to continue with that psyche. In terms of the front end loaded issue with dispositions, we have been disposing for two years, so we have dispositions that we believe will close early on in the year and so those are factual relationships. In terms of acquisitions we just want to be cautious so that we have the appropriate time to make the right decision. Michael Knott : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks and then just curious maybe broadly if you\u2019re seeing any changes in terms of cap rates out there I guess maybe more so on the disposition side for you, since that\u2019s where you\u2019ve been more focused, but just curious what you\u2019re maybe seeing and then maybe any specific comments you could share with respect to, how the market is evaluating Red Lobster pricing today and that opportunity? Glenn Rufrano : In terms of cap rates, I\u2019ve also felt that equity follows debt and if I pick two points in time, I think we\u2019ve had some big differences here, at the end of last year right after the election rates went up as we all know, but we looked at the absolute rate of increase in the bond market, that wasn\u2019t much spreads came in, in the last half of the year, as a matter of fact in last two months of the year. In fact, there were some large deals done Simon, Kimco did some very large bond transactions at very good absolute rates because spreads came in. mortgage rates didn\u2019t come in at the end of the last year. The mortgage market was at the end of its one-year cycle and spreads didn\u2019t come in at all. And if you tried to get a mortgage in the last two months of last year, you got stuck with another 50 to 70 bps more. I believe and our teams believe because we had this conversation it\u2019s already changed this year. The bottom market is still [indiscernible] because there\u2019s capital there, but the mortgage in the market now has new allocations and the spreads in the market have absolutely come in the last couple of months. And so given that, if we don\u2019t have not seen a lot of change in cap rates currently that would have the equity being led by the debt and on top of that, there seems to be a pretty good flow of capital, so at this time these are generalities that we don\u2019t see big differences in cap rates. If I try to dissect them the way you\u2019ve asked larger deals, portfolio deals could have more of a discount, a little cap rate than smaller deals, but across the board we\u2019re seeing general flatness. And then in terms of Red Lobster, not much changed. I will tell you that, a big trend here that will be important it\u2019s the 1031. In fact just talking to some brokers the other day the 1031 player seem to be running right now to make deals perhaps ahead of what could be a change in the tax code next year. so we have not seen much change, the basic deals are 5.5 to 6 and we spread about a point in our joint venture with Golden Gate and so our effective rates have been closed to 7. Michael Knott : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Mitch Germain at JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Peter on for Mitch. Just curious, could you guys quantify the Red Lobster exposure today and what\u2019s left in the forward sales agreement and then maybe what do you guys think gets done this year versus 2018? Thanks. Glenn Rufrano : In terms of the dispositions, we closed about $246 million last year and we think it will be somewhere in the $200 million, $250 million range this year. So that\u2019s how we would quantify what we think we could do. As of now, the effective cap rate 7% that\u2019s realistic for the $250 million for this year. Was that was the primary question? Did I miss the second question? Unidentified Analyst : No, that was it. Just what do you guys think gets done this year and then what would be left for 2018? Glenn Rufrano : If we get to where we want to get to this year, we should be in the 6%, 6.5% range somewhere like that which would mean we may have a little left because we like 5% as a goal, we could have some left in 2018, but we don\u2019t think a lot. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : I\u2019m curious on how you think about the double net leases in your portfolio. Is that something that would perhaps fall under your disposition bucket or something that move away from overtime? I don\u2019t know you would stay in your acquisitions. Glenn Rufrano : It\u2019s always a question of risk reward. When you\u2019re buying asset that\u2019s triple net there\u2019s a risk that\u2019s different from double net. Double net just means in many cases roof [ph] parking lots and so forth. We are fully equipped as a full service real estate operating company to know and understand roofs [ph] and parking lots and so we don\u2019t have a concern relative to having to buy or sell something that\u2019s double net, that is not going to fall in the question because we know how to manage it. We just want to make sure that the risk return relationship makes sense and as you know, it\u2019s far different a double net is far different than running a shopping center or a mall or multi-family property. So we\u2019re very comfortable with double net, we\u2019ll look at both and it\u2019s just a question of the risk return and whether or not we\u2019re being paid for that risk and whether we could manage that risk which we believe, we can do. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay, thanks and then on the fee and leasehold consolidation that you did on three properties in 4Q, are there more of those in the portfolio? And just how the economic for that works? You guys own the land book or then that you own everything or? Glenn Rufrano : Sure just to define, these are three properties. We own the leasehold subject to ground lease payment. The ground lessor came to us and asked that we consider buying the fee and I wish we had a lot of them, we love that. We don\u2019t have many more. What we did here was, we bought the fees on the three properties at a 5.5% cap rate but that allowed us to merge the fee and leasehold interest in our view create value and more importantly two of those three properties were properties in which we renegotiated long-term leases, one of its Del Monte, one of Nesli [ph]. So we were able to buy the fee, negotiate a long-term lease, merge the two estates and create significant value for those properties. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay thanks and then just one question on the same store rent guidance of 0.5%. Does that include the Ovation bankruptcy still or anything kind of holding that back? Glenn Rufrano : No that includes the Ovation bankruptcy. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay, do you know that number without the Ovation bankruptcy? Glenn Rufrano : It would be a bit higher but not dramatically because it will only effect in the first quarter. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Well I guess first on the balance sheet, you guys have done a remarkable job bringing down your debt EBITDA bringing down your leverage, you\u2019re not sitting at 5,7 net debt-to-EBITDA. Just curious on your inclination perhaps to incur a bit more leverage for some acquisitions given the improvement in the balance sheet but also given what the stock price is? Glenn Rufrano : We\u2019ve reflected the target this year of 5, 7 to 6. And where we think we\u2019d like to stay with that ratio. Mike tell us, I think we\u2019re BBB, what do you think? Mike Bartolotta : No I think we\u2019re BBB obviously two out of the three and rated us, basically the equivalent of BBB negative and I think of in lieu of passage of time, hopefully short time we\u2019ll get the BBB. But I think if we\u2019re there where we need to be and so I would not see us taking on significantly more debt, we\u2019ll do things in a leverage neutral basis going forward, but staying at a BBB level. Glenn Rufrano : Okay and then as you can see part an earlier question was the matching of disposition and acquisitions and so we\u2019re creating our own internal capital to match the acquisition program selling assets that will provide us better diversification in buying assets to strengthen portfolio in that process, we do not have to increase it. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate that. So, maybe a bit more discussion around the retail tenant watch list today beyond the more obvious hhgregg and Gander any other kind of incrementally on that list today and then maybe you can share a few names or perhaps sometimes that you\u2019re perhaps concerned about. Glenn Rufrano : We do - I have it in front of me, we do it each quarter. We\u2019re about on probability weighted basis about 1.8% in terms of where we see rent issues, but it\u2019s really scattered the purpose of actually revealing many of our retailers who I think have some of the issues that we\u2019ve all been talking about earlier is that, we don\u2019t have many we mentioned hhgregg we have six stores it\u2019s very small, we have KANs [ph], we have two stores, we have one Gander Mountain, we talked about Logans that we have seven Logans but we renegotiated those deals, so they\u2019re all set. We have six Ruby Tuesday\u2019s. Ruby Tuesday is non-bankruptcy but there are some issues with them, but they\u2019re very small piece of us and so we don\u2019t have a large concentration tier, it\u2019s a bunch of smaller credits which we care a lot about because we want to make sure we get a re-nickel but I can\u2019t tell you, there\u2019s something, there\u2019s so many on our list that is big. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough and then one last one, final I have you. It\u2019s been you\u2019ve accomplished a lot the last couple of years since joining. I\u2019m curious now that you stand here today thinking about where you\u2019re taking the company next you lead out some goals for reduction to certain asset types, tenants, balance sheet but just curious how you see yourself perhaps solving the valuation gap that still exists between you and some of your peers. Beyond obviously the litigation [indiscernible] perhaps you could share some thoughts on strategically the next few milestones that you\u2019re thinking of where you\u2019re taking this company the next couple of years that we should be thinking about. Glenn Rufrano : Well as you can see what we\u2019ve been focusing on portfolio, portfolio and making sure that it\u2019s well diversified portfolio and balance sheet, balance sheet. Well we continue to work on those two, I would expect that given the right portfolio and we\u2019ll be there soon and the balance sheet we have that we should be in a position which is really a key position for us to start growing AFFO. I mean that\u2019s - I think our guidance this year is reasonable at $0.70 and $0.73 it reflects what we had to do in the balance sheet to get to investment grade we\u2019re there. I was hoping to expect that the gap closes and we\u2019ll continue to close as the market sees us in a position to grow AFFO and we believe this is the year, we should stabilize ourselves. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks everybody for joining us today and look forward to your thoughts and comments, talk to you soon. Bye now. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to the VEREIT First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] And please note that the event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Bonni Rosen : Thank you. Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2017 first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 3 :00 PM Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529, with a confirmation code of 10104472. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings and business update call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT\u2019s actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Annual Report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today\u2019s call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly financial results. Glenn will then wrap up with closing remarks. We will conclude today\u2019s call by opening the line for questions. Glenn? Glenn Rufrano : Thanks Bonni, and thanks for all you are joining today. Let me begin with a summary of a few items. For the quarter, AFFO per diluted share was $0.19. Acquisitions to date totaled 116.1 million. We completed approximately 213.9 million of dispositions. Net debt to EBITDA decreased to 5.5 times. Both Moody's and S&P recently upgraded the company to investment grade and we are reaffirming guidance provided in our last call of $0.70 to $0.73 of AFFO.  Starting with operations, occupancy was 98.4%, up slightly from 98.3%. Same store rent was down 0.3% for the quarter excluding the effects of the Ovation bankruptcy in last year's early renewal efforts, same store rents would have increased 0.3%. During the quarter, we entered into 61,000 square feet of new leases and 308,000 square feet of renewals of which 138,000 square feet were executed earlier. Notable lease transactions included 32,000 square foot office to franchise food, six bank locations and 125,000 square feet of restaurants space. Since introducing our business plan portfolio diversification has been enhanced by culling, going forward acquisitions will contribute. Year to date acquisitions are 116.1 million including 14.6 million subsequent to the quarter. The 21 transactions included retail properties in multiple categories; grosser, convenience, automotive service, and fitness; three leased fee interests and the distribution facility.  As mentioned last quarter, the industrial asset is leased to Best Buy, also our retail tenant. We find the cross property relationship for 20 of our tenants representing approximately 20% of our revenue. Year-to-date we have sold 55 assets spread across our strategic categories totaling 213.9 million including 14.7 million subsequent to the quarter. Dispositions included Red Lobster restaurants reducing exposure to the end of Q1 to 7.4% from 8.2% as well as office non-core properties and flat leases. Turning to the balance sheet, net debt to EBITDA was 5.5 times providing ample room for leverage neutral acquisitions. Also 99% of our debt is fixed, less than any near term impact from potential interest rate increases. The progress we've made during the past two years resulted in Moody\u2019s upgrading VEREIT to Baa3, while S&P brought the company to BBB- matching the prior rating in our debt.  The company is now investment grade with all three major agencies including Fitch. During the quarter Cole Capital raised 66.7 million of new equity, an average of 22.2 million a month with a 25% monthly increase in March compared to February. Additionally, 18 new selling agreements were signed in Q1 representing more than 4,500 financial advisors. In April, Advisory Group one of Cole\u2019s historically large broker dealer partners approved CCPT5 and initiated sales efforts. So Tara began INEP earlier this year and launched the CCPT5 last month. New equity for April was 24.7 million. Before Mike reviews our financial results let we provide a brief update on litigation. The plaintiffs in the class action have filed their motion for a class certification and defendants will file their responses by the end of this week. A conference is scheduled with the court on May 16. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-Q filed today. Let me now turn over the call to Mike. Mike Bartolotta : Thanks Glenn and thank you all for joining us today. We had a good quarter achieving AFFO of $0.19 per diluted share, consolidated revenue was 348 million just below last quarter's revenue of 351.9 million, mostly due to our disposition program. Before I discuss the rest of our current Q1 2017 results, let me highlight the effects of certain Q4 activity that otherwise skews our quarterly performance comparisons. These items were all noted in Q4 and included 120.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and 11.1 million program development right off and 5.2 million of compensated related charges, all partially offset by 5.7 million of the applicable tax effect on these items. Now let's review the main comparative operational changes for the quarter. We reported Q1 2017 net income of 14.8 million versus a net loss of 118.2 million for Q4 2016. Without the items noted previously you would have seen a Q1 2017 increase in net income of 1.5 million. The slight increase was mostly the result of lower depreciation and amortization primarily driven by the property dispositions and increase in the net gain on properties sold, all partially offset by slightly lower revenue, higher net litigation costs and tax expenses. FFO per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.17 as compared to $0.05 for the fourth quarter. However, the FFO for Q4 2016 excluding charges noted earlier would have been $0.19 per share or Q1 2017 decrease of $0.02 per share. This was mainly due to the lower revenue previously mentioned along with increased net litigation costs which were really driven by $10 million insurance proceeds received in Q4 and the net negative quarter to quarter tax provision. AFFO was $0.19 per diluted share as compared to $0.17 for the fourth quarter, however again excluding the impact of the Q4 2016 charges, Q4 AFFO would have been $0.19 per share or flat when compared to Q1. G&A for the quarter was 29.1 million versus 44.4 million for the fourth quarter representing a decrease of 15.2 million. However, G&A for Q4 2016 without the items noted would have been 28.1 million or Q1 2017 increase of 1 million.  Real estate G&A was 12.6 million for the quarter, down 0.7 million from 13.3 million in the prior quarter, mostly due to the normal year-end activity in the fourth quarter. Cole Capital G&A was 16.6 million in Q1, up 1.8 million from 14.8 million in Q4 excluding the charges previously noted. This was due primarily to an increase in program development costs which represented resulting from a decrease in the expected future recovery rate effective Q1 2017. Legal costs related to the matters arising from the Audit Committee investigation which are included in litigation and other non-routine costs were approximately 12.7 million for this quarter. Turning to the first quarter real estate activity, the company purchased 16 properties for 81.8 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.1%. In addition, we purchased the fee interest in three properties for 24 million which were already on the lease holds at an average cash cap rate of 5.5%.  We were able to extend the leases on two of these properties and increased NAV. Subsequent to the quarter, the company purchased two properties for 14.6 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.7%. During the quarter we sold 50 properties for 199.2 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.3% and a gain of 12.5 million. Subsequent to the quarter, the company disposed of five properties for an aggregate sales price of 14.7 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.1%. Our balance sheet remains very safe and liquid, we continue to have full capacity under our credit facility of 2.3 billion at 286 million in cash and essentially no floating debt. During the quarter we had net repayments of 81.7 million of secured debt with only 301 million coming due the remainder of the year. And any secured debt coming due is expected to eventually be termed out with unsecured debt.  Cash flow provides ample coverage for our dividends. As Glenn mentioned we have now achieved investment grade on all three - from all three rating agencies, which is a true testament to what the team has accomplished. As of 3/31, our net debt to normalized EBITDA was reduced to 5.5 times from 7.5 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 2.9 times and our net debt to gross asset ratios has been reduced to 39%. Our incumbent asset ratio was 67% and the weighted average duration of our debt stands at 4.2 years. And with that I'll turn the call back to Glenn. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks Mike. In late May, many of us will head to ICSC RECon the largest real estate conference in the world. As an ICSC trustee I have the opportunity to spend time with other retail landlords, developers and advisors as well as executive of many tenants. RECon is an excellent opportunity to meet face to face with our retailers, learn more about their operations and discuss how we can leverage our partnership.  During the two and a half day conference, we\u2019ll host nearly 90 face to face meetings with tenants like Home Depot, TJX, Michaels, PetSmart, LA Fitness, Dick's Sporting Goods and [indiscernible] amongst others and including restaurant. Following RECon our real estate teams will travel to many of our tenants corporate headquarters for strategic alliance reviews to discuss existing lease structures and renewals as well as acquisition opportunities for their long-term housing needs. Although I\u2019m sure our discussions at RECon will revolve around the ever changing retail environment, all industries are prone to cyclical and secular disruptives. Cyclical change can be a product of overbuilding the rise and fall of brands or macroeconomic issues such as consumer confidence or changing interest rates. Secular changes are long lasting and there are a number of these changes taking place as we speak; ecommerce and omni-channel relationships, plus office space per square foot per person, increased industrial ceiling height, just to name a few.  Real estate investors approach these conditions in a number of ways. If you are not in an opportunistic fund, you may attempt to market time and try to arbitrage the profit from the resulting changes. However REITs are long-term vehicles that must adopt the strategy to help minimize the negative impact of such trends. For VEREIT, our long-term strategy of well positioned properties in a diversified portfolio made optimum by our size. Helps protect us from a variety of changes. Key portfolio metrics include 4,100 properties representing 42 industries and 663 tenant concepts. Properties dispersed across 49 states. The top ten tenets comprising only 29.5% of the portfolio and property type diversification with retail, restaurants, office, and industrial helping mitigate risk. Focusing on our retail mix, we're dominated by off price and necessity shopping of which 50% is investment grade.  In many of our core categories we see reasonable expansion plans in 2017 and beyond. In more detailed analysis of our merchandise categories are deals discount comprised of 7.9%, pharmacy 7.2, grocer 5.1, home and garden 4.5 and convenience 2.5%. Approximately 67% of our retail revenue is derived from tenants that are public companies providing increased transparency into their operations and finances. Our single tenant retail tends to have the following advantages. Credit tenants on long term leases with substantial capital investments. Generally no use restrictions or [indiscernible] issues and the ability to target tenants and industries. As we mentioned last quarter, we have virtually no traditional department stores or material exposure to specialty apparel and within sporting goods and electronics are limited tendency is dominated by strong operators. We're comfortable with our size, diversity and our single tenant focus. I\u2019ll now open the lines to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first questioner today is going to Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Knott : Just curious if you're seeing any weakness perhaps in the restaurant trade or just given the weakness that your peer mentioned yesterday when they reported their earnings? Glenn Rufrano : Have not Michael, I think what's important in our restaurants is the take a look at who we have and the diversification. We feel very good about Red Lobster as you know and also happy that they were recapitalized with Thai Union recently. But once you go beyond Red Lobster, if you look at the rest, Applebee's is 1.7, Olive Garden 0.6, 0.5, Cracker Barrel 0.5, [indiscernible] about 0.7. So we have a good stable of restaurants and the diversification, it helps that add a lot, so we're very comfortable. Michael Knott : And then just couple other quick ones for me. Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about Cole Capital today and any decisions that you think you might reach on that business line maybe by the end of the year and just how you see it position today from a broad standpoint? Glenn Rufrano : We were happy to announce that advisory group came on, which was one of our larger broker dealers in the \u201913 to \u201914 era. And we did announce last quarter at the end of the year that Cetera came on. So the progress we've made with the larger advisors, larger broker dealers has been very helpful for us to establish the brand value of Cole. We're getting there that progress means a lot to us. We will make a decision relative to the value of Cole and how the public market sees it. It may be later on this year, it may be the beginning of next year, but what we care about is establishing and maintaining that value. Michael Knott : And then last question from me would just be one of your peers recently had a nice credit upgrade from one of their C store tenants they got acquired by 711 and just curious if the reports are true about BJs wholesale perhaps being up for sale, would you put any stock in getting a credit upgrade there since I think that's a B- credit at present. Glenn Rufrano : BJ is a Northeastern company that has really terrific locations, they're certainly not on par with Costco. If they got upgraded because someone acquired them that would be very nice. We're not going to bet on that. We\u2019re happy with their credit right now and like the position we have there. Operator : And our next questioner today is going to be Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Good afternoon. Glenn, could you give us an insight on your tenant watch list now and how it might compare to year-end? Has there been any meaningful changes to that watchlist? Glenn Rufrano : Sure, Sheila. At year-and, we\u2019ve discussed a watchlist and we have a series of tenants with probability weighting of about 1.8%. We've had a very slight increase in that this quarter. We thought it was prudent to look at every tenant, which we have and we're now at about 2%. So it is a very slight increase, but I will tell you it was a thorough review that we had here to get there. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then on the acquisition side of things, the last two quarters, you have added assets, but you're still selling more than you're acquiring on balance sheet. Just wondering if we look out through the balance of the year, should we assume on the balance sheet that you'll be a net seller of assets? Glenn Rufrano : Our guidance, which we reaffirmed on this call Sheila has us selling about 450 to 600 in assets and buying about 450 to 600 in assets. We believe those bids for now. We also mentioned when we gave guidance that we would have more dispositions in the beginning of the year and acquisitions at the end of the year and we're conforming to it. And I would also mention that as you would expect, we are very cautious on acquiring anything at any point in time in the economy. Frankly, I mentioned on the call last time I never gave acquisition guidance before. But we thought it\u2019s appropriate here. We're going to buy appropriate assets. We are very targeted in what we will buy. We're pleased with what we've bought this quarter and if we can continue to finance it that fit the merchandise categories with the tenants we're looking for in retail and we can find the industrial properties that fit our locational requirements we believe we\u2019ll be able to buy that enough assets for guidance and our disposition program has gone well with 200 million in the fourth quarter, 132 million of which were Red Lobsters, we feel we're well on our way to that $450 million to $600 million number. Operator : And our next questioner today is going to be Mitch Germain with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Mitch Germain : Good afternoon. Just, Glenn, you talked about the secular disruptors I think. And so I'm curious how that's affecting the way that you think about your current portfolio and how you think about your sale and acquisition platform? Glenn Rufrano : Well, of all the disruptors that are on top of mind today Mitch, it\u2019s certainly the disruptors related to retail. So, let me start there. Capitalism is a hard system. Retail has to be one of the most capitalist business there is. You either fail or win and that's been that way for many, many years. Today, if we look at the disruptors, we have to think about omnichannel and the different method of merchandising. We have tenants that don't embrace omnichannel. We have tenants that can\u2019t afford omnichannel and then we have tenants who can embrace and afford it. The first two, we're not interested in.  The third one, we really care about and how that disruptor affects our tenants. But the second very important part in retail and in disruptors is just true retail value. Put omnichannel aside, for a very long time, we've talked about a retailer having to provide value and that's merchandise, price and service. What we care about here is we\u2019ll be looking at categories and tenants that both can service omnichannel distribution, but as important, can provide value to the clientele.  When we look at our merchandise groups, we're comfortable with our merchandise groups that we're focused on and we have dominance in, discount, grocer, pharmacy, Home and Garden, convenience and within each one, we want the tenants that can afford to pay for omnichannel distribution and provide value. So that would be the number one disruptor that we talked about and that concept is extremely important in both dispositions in what we're selling, we want to dispose, the tenants cannot provide the services and we want to acquire the tenants that can provide those services.  In terms of other property types, clearly office and industrial, we will be very careful. We\u2019re not buying office, as you know, but we have been selling office and we want to make sure our office tenants who don't -- our office properties that don't conform to the disruptors not enough parking. Not functional space, we're going to sell those and we're going to be very careful in acquiring any industrial property to make sure it's functional relative to the new age of physical plant. Mitch Germain : Great. That's helpful. The improvement in the Red Lobster brand and sales, does that change your thinking about how you think about capping the revenues from that -- for the rents from that customers? Glenn Rufrano : We like what's going on at Red Lobster in that right now and need to tell you, but we are going to be committed to diversification. We don't really want tenants over 5% and so we will bring it down. We will bring it down, we'd like to get it down to 6% by the end of the year. We sold 132 million. Our goal this year was 200 to 250. So you can see we're well on our way. We've sold $805 million dollars of Red Lobsters of the 1.6 billion. We will have by the end of this year gotten close to $1 billion in sales. Once we get to that 5% plus or minus, then we'll hold Red Lobster and we'll watch it every day, but we'll hold it, but we're not -- we're going to conform to our general concepts of diversification just because we're not smart enough to know who's good and who's bad five years from now. Mitch Germain : Great. Last one from me. Guidance, you started the year at $0.19, just, it seems like if I\u2019m thinking about this the right way, you\u2019re at the higher end, if not even above it, what could go wrong to get you below 73? Mike Bartolotta : Well, let's just, it was a good quarter and we're happy with that. One of the 19, we\u2019d love the 19, but we have projected more dispositions in the beginning of the year and acquisitions tail ended and that will reduce that number. So the capital allocation alone will cause that to drop a bit and then we would hope obviously it picks up again once those acquisitions kick in, assuming we find the properties we want. What could affect it is credit. Do we have some tenants that then go bankrupt other than we have minor issues now as you know one, Gander Mountain [indiscernible], none of which are major components of revenue, all of which we're working on. We don't see other tenants. We don't see other credit issues right now. That would be the cause of it. But we just don't see it right now. Operator : And our next questioner is going to be Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Lucas : Glenn, just kind of following up on a little bit on the last question, but really on your comment about the probability weighted risk going from 180 basis points to 200 basis points. Is that a function of an add to the list of concerns or just an increase in the probability of concerns? Glenn Rufrano : We had two small adds that we're not sure that -- which do not have high probabilities, but we just thought prudent to add. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then as it relates to Cetera, I know they\u2019ve been on since January. I guess I'm curious as to whether or not you're getting any traction at this point with the sales team and whether or not their share of sales has picked up at all since January? Glenn Rufrano : The first product they took Chris was INEP. And they're just starting to pick -- we are just starting to get sales in over the last two months. CCPT5, they have just picked up, have not -- we have not had any sales, but we do expect sales over the second, third and fourth quarter. So it is just beginning for Cetera. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then last question for me is just related to the transactional market, your peer announced that they had walked away from their pipeline recently. Just curious as to whether or not that had any impact on deals you were working on, either on the disposition or acquisition side? Glenn Rufrano : I'm not sure of the exact transactions and I really don't know the answers to that Chris. We're looking at our own pipeline and our own acquisition activity and as you can see, it\u2019s 100 million, a little less than what some of our peers that I've seen have done, but that\u2019s had no concern to me at all. We're only going to buy if we like it. So I don't really have an answer in terms of whether or not someone walking away affected the market. Operator : And our next questioner today is Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your questions. Joshua Dennerlein : Curious to know, so it sounds like at the end of this year, you\u2019re going to just call market and buy -- for the internal value of it. How would you think about the value of the firm and potentially selling that? I mean when I look at it, cost of equity is compared and then on the debt side, you\u2019re going to have to turn out the debt and going to be rolling up on interest rates. So just wondering how you would think about potentially selling the company and walking away? Glenn Rufrano : Selling the company meaning Cole, just -- Joshua Dennerlein : No. Like VEREIT in general. Glenn Rufrano : So no, that\u2019s fine. I mean the first thing I\u2019d say is we will always care about the value of the company and if someone were to come along and want to buy the company at a price that we thought was a very good price, there's no social issues around that and it\u2019s a board decision, it's not my decision, but I'm sure our board would look favorably upon real good value for this company if it could be achieved. In terms of acquiring an enterprise like this relative to the debt, it would be just the normal covenants and restrictions that any company would go through. We wouldn't have anything here that\u2019s any different or special. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. Is there anything you would want to clean up beforehand, so to maximize the value of VEREIT outside of Cole? Glenn Rufrano : Well, anything that we want to clean up, we clean up regardless of buyer. That\u2019s just what we have to do on an everyday basis. So we've given a business plan as you know. We've accomplished a good part of that. We've provided guidance for the year, which we think is very reasonable. We want to make that guidance, we want to do it in the right way. Those are our tours. That's what we'll do. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. And one last question. Would you, I mean -- would you go around shopping yourself or would it have to be someone coming to you? Glenn Rufrano : Let's just say that, I was around when we sold new plants in April of 2007. It\u2019s a $6 billion company. Let's just say I know enough and that we have enough experience people to know if there was something to be done, how to do it. Operator : And the next question today will come from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Anthony Paolone : Thank you. So the stock market is pretty negative on retail related stuff. And I'm wondering as you look in the private markets for small asset, net lease properties, which has historically attracted a lot of individual investors and small groups because of its small ticket price, has any of that narrative seeped into that market, are you seeing anything there that's causing any buyer groups to come step back? Glenn Rufrano : I would tell you, as we look at the acquisitions we\u2019re seeing today, I\u2019ve not seen a lot of pricing differential. Really, so the answer in the private market as of now, it's not reacted anywhere close to what we're seeing the public market doing there as we speak. It's clear larger deals could have a little more discount than smaller deals, but other than that, not on lot.  Now, maybe it will happen, what -- and I'm going to talk about us, what I like about our business as compared to and as we talk about retailers as compared to being in the shopping center of the business, the mall business and those businesses are -- not being negative on those businesses, if you buy a shopping center, you buy a mall, you buy everything in it. What I like about the single tenant market is we buy a single tenant, we buy a single category. We don't have to take what comes along with it. So we can make sure that whatever we're buying and whatever we're paying makes sense relatives to the portfolio. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then you reiterated your plans on the acquisition disposition side for this year. Is there a point at which the stock price affects your thoughts on what you're doing there? Glenn Rufrano : We're still funding this year. We\u2019re at 5.5 as Mike and I indicated on our net debt to EBITDA on target of 5.7 to 6. So we\u2019re a bit below that. So we have plenty of firepower to stay within our leverage neutral concept and internally fund acquisitions. So we're not concerned with that right now. Our job this year is to dispose of assets that will create more diversification for us and buy assets to fortify the portfolio. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then what does it take to get on the watchlist for you all? Glenn Rufrano : I think not a lot. I think we're going to be very cautious these days. We have a function as you would expect, a credit function that\u2019s following all our credit. If it's a public company, as I mentioned, we have a lot of public companies in retail. We're following them every quarter. We're reading anything we can in the newspapers about them. On our private companies, we do get financials. We're reviewing them every quarter or quicker, so that any time that we hear or see of an issue relative to debt covenants, a purchase an M&A transaction, we will look at all those factors and taken them into consideration. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just last question for a non-warrior, what are the potential outcomes of the May 16 conference decided? Glenn Rufrano : Well, the conference on May 16 centers around class certification and the judge can\u2019t rule in the case or not. The judge can ask for more discovery relative to class certification or not. We'll have to wait and see. Anthony Paolone : When you say rule on the case, you mean actually -- Glenn Rufrano : Rule that the class has been accepted or not. Operator : There look to be no further questions. So this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks. Glenn Rufrano : I thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to going ICSC and meeting with people in NAREIT and talking about what we found. Thank you very much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Bonni Rosen : Thank you. Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2017 second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 3 :00 PM Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529 with the confirmation code of 10109813. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT's actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the quarterly report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today's call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly financial results. Glenn will then wrap up with closing remarks. We will conclude today's call by opening the line for questions. Glenn? Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, Bonni, and thanks for joining our call. Results are as expected. For the quarter, AFFO per diluted share is $0.18. To-date, acquisitions totaled $273.3 million and we've completed $433.6 million of dispositions. In line with guidance, disposition is frontend loaded and acquisition is backend. Net debt to EBITDA decreased to 5.4 times, before the guidance range of 5.7 to 6, providing capital flexibility. And we are narrowing our AFFO guidance from $0.70-to-$0.73 to $0.71-to-$0.73 per share. Starting with operations, occupancy was 98.6%, up slightly from 98.4%. Same-store rent was flat for the quarter. Excluding the effects of our early lease renewals efforts, same-store would have increased 0.3%. During the quarter, we had 720,000 square feet of lease renewals, of which 523,000 square feet were executed early. Notable early lease transactions included Wells Fargo and Rockwell Collins office properties, as well as the renewal for an industrial facility to lease to Iron Mountain. For the year, we have renewed 368,000 square feet of leases with a 100% recovery. We've also completed more than 660,000 square feet of early lease renewals with a 91% recovery. These leases have built in increases in an average wealth of 12 years. Turning to capital activity, during the quarter, we completed a restaurant exchange with Golden Gate Capital. In the transaction, VEREIT received 22 Bob Evans Restaurants by that 50 million, in exchange for 15 Red Lobster properties with the same value. This NOI exchange contributed to a reduction in our Red Lobster exposure to 7%, down from 7.4% and further diversified our restaurant portfolio on a non-dilutive basis. Second quarter acquisitions were $101.6 million and $70.2 million subsequent to the quarter. These 41 transactions included retail properties in multiple categories such as fitness, automotive service, hobby, and home and garden, as well two industrial properties representing 35% of the transactions. For the year, acquisitions totaled $273.3 million. Second quarter dispositions were $224.8 million with $9.6 million subsequent to the quarter. These 44 transactions were spread across our strategic categories, and included Red Lobster office, non-core properties, restaurants and flat leases. Of note, we sold a large energy-related office building in Texas for $387 a foot. Dispositions for the year now totaled $433.6 million, near the low end of our $450 million to $600 million guidance range. Capital allocation has strengthened the balance sheet with net debt to EBITDA of 5.4 times, providing ample room for leverage-neutral acquisitions. 99% of our debt is fixed, lessening any near-term impact of potential interest rate increases. During the quarter, Cole Capital raised $78 million of new equity, an average of $26 million a month, and an increase of 17% over the first quarter, while the industry was down 37%. Additionally, 23 new selling agreements were signed in Q2, representing more than 15,000 financial advisors. New equity for July was $22.3 million. Before Mike reviews our financial results, let me provide a brief update on litigation. The Court heard oral argument on the plaintiff's motion for class certification and scheduled a hearing on August 24 for each side's expert to testify regarding the class certification issues. Document discovery has also been substantially completed. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-Q filed today. Let me now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Bartolotta : Thanks, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a good quarter, achieving AFFO of $0.18 per diluted share. Consolidated revenue was $336.9 million, below last quarter's revenue of $348 million, primarily due to net dispositions during the year, along with lower operating expense reimbursements in certain adjustments to CAM. Net income for the second quarter was $34.2 million versus net income of $14.8 million last quarter. The increase was mostly the result of a higher gain on properties sold in this quarter, along with a gain on extinguishment of debt this quarter, partially offset by lower real estate revenue and a higher impairment charge. FFO per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.17, consistent with the first quarter also at $0.17. Q2 had lower real estate revenue, along with higher litigation costs, partially offset by a gain on the extinguishment of debt and a decrease in the income tax provision, resulting in a flat quarter-over-quarter change. AFFO was $0.18 per diluted share versus $0.19 last quarter, mainly due to lower real estate revenue and the increase in current income and franchise taxes, offset by lower property operating, G&A and interest expenses, along with an increase in Cole Capital revenue. G&A for the quarter was $29.4 million versus $29.1 million for the first quarter, representing an increase of $0.3 million. Real estate G&A was $14.3 million for the quarter, up $1.7 million from $12.7 million in the prior quarter. This was mostly due to the equity-based compensations for directors that is granted and vest in Q2, and certain annual filing fees incurred in Q2. Cole Capital G&A was $15.1 million in the second quarter, down $1.5 million from $16.6 million in Q1. This decrease was mainly due to slightly lower compensation and benefits, professional fees and office expenses during the quarter. Legal expenses related to the matters arising from the Audit Committee investigation, which are included in litigation and other non-routine costs were approximately $14.4 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount to $27 million. Turning to our second quarter real estate activity, the company purchased 38 properties for $101.6 million at an average cash cap rate of 7%. Subsequent to the quarter of the company purchased three properties for $70.2 million and an average cash cap rate of 6.5%. During the quarter, we disposed of 37 properties for $224.8 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.9% and a gain of $43.1 million, subsequent to the quarter the company disposed of seven properties for an aggregate sales price of $9.6 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.2%. Our balance sheet remains very safe and liquid, we continue to have full capacity under our credit facility of $2.3 billion. At June 30, we also had $292.5 million in cash and essentially no floating rate debt. During the quarter, we've reduced secured debt by $203.8 million with only $162.5 million coming due during the remainder of the year. Any secured debt coming due is expected to eventually be termed out with unsecured debt. As of June 30, our net debt to normalized EBITDA was reduced to 5.4 times from 5.5 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 3 times, and our net debt to gross real estate investments ratio was 38%. Our unencumbered asset ratio was 70% and the weighted average duration of our debt stands at 4 years. And with that, I'll turn it back to Glenn. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, Mike. REITs business model incorporate the large diversified portfolio providing the ability to whether cyclical and secular change. We maintain a proven infrastructure and the expertise to effectively manage our portfolio. Our focus in on four property types, single-tenant retail, restaurant, office and industrial, which spreads volatility and provide optionality to take advance of market dislocations over time. Presenting the characteristics of our property types, we can illustrate our risk is mitigated. Single-tenant retail is differentiated from other general retail format, we have a large percentage of credit tenants 47% of investment grade and 66% of our tenants are public companies. Generally, we do not have co-tenancy or occupancy requirements. We are able to target individual tenants and merchandise categories, and our portfolio was dominated by off price and necessity shopping with only 0.2% of income from apparel and jewelry, far less than other retail formats. Our diversified restaurant portfolio is primarily comprised a strong national dinning concepts, according to Nation's Restaurant News, which publishes the top industry brand based upon system like sales. 86% of our casual dining tenants and 78% of our cook service restaurants are ranked in the top 25 of their respective category, beyond Red Lobster, we have low concentration by tenant concepts. Combined 92% of our retail tenant based is service, retail merchandise categories with lower online disruption and restaurants. The average size of our office assets are 148,000 square feet with 59% of our tenants investment grade. These properties are strategic to their companies business with 33% corporate headquarters and 67% corporate operations. Facilities are spread across top MSAs such as Chicago, Dallas, Boston and Washington, D.C. Our industrial assets are in close proximity to ports, railways and major freeways with three quarters located in the top 50 markets, as logistics and delivery become increasingly important. Our properties are essential to the tenants operations with 87% dedicated to distribution and warehousing. 57% of our industrial tenants are investment grade. Our ability to implement our plan during the past two years has enabled us to strengthen our business model and reshape the portfolio. We have sold over $3 billion of assets including approximately $890 million of office, $870 million of Red Lobster restaurants, $710 million in flat leases, $360 million of non-core and $125 million of retail joint ventures, in all realizing a gain of $200 million. We've decreased top 10 tenant portfolio concentration from 33.3% to 29.4% and reduced net debt-to-EBITDA from 7.6 times to 5.4 times today. We are now poised to provide capital to corporate clients through a targeted acquisition process. With that, I'll now open the line to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Glenn Rufrano : Yes, good afternoon. Joshua Dennerlein : A question, how should we think about acquisitions and dispositions for the second half of the year? Do you expect to kind of stay near the lower end of your range for dispositions or do you think you'll keep chugging through? And do you expect to be a net acquirer? Glenn Rufrano : Well, we are at $433 million of dispositions. We're pretty close to the low end. I would expect we'll be somewhere between the $450 million and $600 million. And if we find the right pricing on the assets for sale, we could be closer to $600 million. On the acquisitions, as we mentioned in our guidance, it would be tail end loaded. We're $273 million to-date. We do expect to get and we will get into the guidance of $450 million to $600 million. And if we can find the right acquisitions, we would expect to be in the higher end of that range. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. And moving on, have you started your evaluation of whether or not Cole is better inside VEREIT or potentially sold off to a third party? Glenn Rufrano : Well, our goal has continued to be to reestablish and increase the value of Cole. We believe we've done a really good job of that. And we continue to do that. The critical issues this year have been bringing Cetera and Advisor Group on, two very large companies, who are now just beginning to sell. For instance, Cetera has now started marketing INAV, and over the last few months have increased their sales nicely. They are just going to start as we speak V and III. They've been approved. And so, we're hoping to see some benefit of that in the tail end of the year. Advisor Group has approved V and has been increasing sales of V over the last few months. They will now being their due diligence on INAV and then III. So we are expecting to have some real nice push there. As we look at reestablishing net value, we'll then think about what we do about Cole, whether it's internal or external. Our goal is to increase value. We'll then decide whether the market is valuing it properly. Joshua Dennerlein : Got it, and one last one for me, the Red Lobster and Bob Evans exchange, can you discuss how that came about and if there is opportunity to do more? Glenn Rufrano : Well, the Golden Gate Capital as you know owns Red Lobsters, is a terrific partner that's done a great job on Red Lobster. They purchased Bob Evans. And we saw an opportunity for us to sell Red Lobster, which is a goal. Even though the properties are doing well, we just want to take that concentration down. And at the same time, diversify our casual dining portfolio with Bob Evans, which is a brand we like certainly in the hands of Golden Gate. Not only we like them, they are 5,600 square feet. We've got good corners. And so, we thought it would be a good way to have an acquisition and disposition at the same time. It was an NOI exchange. And that allowed us to diversify on a purely non-dilutive basis. The valuation cap rate for Red Lobster, for each of the portfolio was 7.25. And remember, as we sell Red Lobster, as we have been selling Red Lobsters. The net to us is about 7 on an individual property. $50 million, 7.25 seems fair. And we thought it's a very fair price for Bob Evans. As a matter of fact, in terms of comps, we think that was very fair. So Golden Gate helped us. And we'd love to find opportunities like that. They're rare though. Joshua Dennerlein : Got it. Thank you [indiscernible]. Operator : The next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good afternoon. Glenn, I was wondering if you could touch on the tenant watch-list, any notable change from last quarter and your insights just on retail, grocery store and movie theatre exposure. Glenn Rufrano : Sure, I'll start out with the credit watch-list. Last quarter, we were just slightly over 2%. We're the same, Sheila. We really haven't changed very much. If you think about the quarter, there hasn't been as much noise in the second quarter as in the first. There's been some with a few mall tenants like True Religion and Michael Kors. And there's also been some discussion on movie theatres. We have none. So I could answer that right away for you. Sheila McGrath : Thank you. Glenn Rufrano : And so we have found the quarter that didn't change much at all in our credit watch. I think your second part of that was retail and general. Sheila McGrath : Well, retail and also just your thoughts on grocery stores. Glenn Rufrano : Got you. On grocers, our grocers are 4.5% our income right now. Of that, Albertsons is just about 2% - got 2.1% and then the rest are spread out amongst many others. No other grocer more than 0.7%. And so, they're pretty diversified group of grocers. We feel pretty good about it. They're traditional and compete well. The sales are good for the grocers we get sales for. Our total occupancy cost is 2.7%. And so we're well within the range of them being able to pay us. And so we're happy with the grocer concentration we have right now. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And one follow-up, on the legal settlement process, if you can just give us your insight, if the guilty verdict on the prior CFO, does that have any impact on this legal process. And then if you can just give us some insight, I know you can early comment on magnitude and stuff, but just key assign on kind of the steps in terms of timing, you mentioned in August Day, and that was in the Q, so just some clarity that you can frame for us on that? Glenn Rufrano : On the court case, Sheila, what I can say is that the civil lawsuits will continue to proceed on the contract, there are no change in that. In terms of the timing, class certification was the concept that I just talked about in that. What will be reviewed on the August Meeting. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And so will there be news in August that you would - that we would hear or that just like a formality? Glenn Rufrano : There could be news, because the court could rule on the class certification in it, so we would announce whatever that ruling is, it's not just a formality, it's a formal process. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Thank you. Glenn Rufrano : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Michael Knott : Hey, guys. Glenn, just curious how are you thinking about the Red Lobster concentration, if you still expect to get that down to 6% by the end of the year. And then what the timing would be to hit the ultimate goal on that? Glenn Rufrano : Yeah, we're at 7 now which is pretty good. I think, there is a shot to get close to 6%. We clearly, we are marketing them, Michael, we are continuing to do that. But we are making sure, we are marketing them prudently, we have gained continually there, as you can see that's a good part of the $200 million in gains we've had. We bought them at 7.8 and we're selling them at less. And we expect to continue that. So I'd say there is a good chance, we'll get very close to 6%. And then, we will look into next year to move it down to the 5% range. Michael Knott : And then just in general, if it does turnout that you are sort of pivoting in the back half more towards being a net buyer, just curious I think about sort of extrapolating the trend into 2018, if you were in our shoes, how would you think about, how much of pivoting that might be, how are you thinking about your cost of capital today? Glenn Rufrano : I think, part of your question is net buyer. We would expect in 2018 to have less disposition activity, because our portfolio as we've illustrated getting pretty close to where we would like to be from a diversification standpoint. So if we do - we have left disposition next year. If we find acquisition activity that will help us be a net acquirer next year. So that's an expectation. In terms of cost of capital today, everything is self-financed. We talked about our net debt to EBITDA of 5.4 times, well below the target of 5.7 to 6. So we have debt capacity, and we have other disposition activity to finance those certainly to this year. Michael Knott : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Mitchell Germain : Good afternoon. So Glenn, I want to ask Mike's question in a different way. I know you have some contracts or obviously, some agreement in place to sell some Red Lobster next year, I think it's around 250 is all of that still a play here or is it now just really your ability or you guys are wanting to sell Red Lobster at your schedule? Glenn Rufrano : It's really in our schedule. We have pretty good flexibility here. There are no constraints over the next year and all in terms of selling Red Lobster. So it's up to us, we like it, we love the 20 year leases, the exchange we've made of 20 year leases for Red Lobster's, for roughly 20 year leases of Bob Evans, so that's wonderful. But we'll continue to look at selling them at the right price. Mitchell Germain : Got you. And I just - one last question for me in terms of guidance. I think, you obviously narrowed the range, but if we kind of think of the cadence for the next two quarters, if dispositions slow, acquisitions pick up, it seems like, if nothing changes from your current levels, you already at the high end of the range, you have the net acquisition you might actually have some offside to that. So just curious about your thoughts in terms of how the playbook looks rest of the year? Glenn Rufrano : The pickup on the bottom, I'd start there, is a result of being $0.01 over consensus as you can see $0.19 and $0.18, which we believe will stabilize that bottom. In terms of the top end of the range, you point is the exact point. How we have net acquisitions in the last half of the year. We have the capacity, and we certainly have the throughput we have in the first two quarters about $12 billion of deals given to us to take a look at. So the markets there, it's only a question of whether we find the transactions, we like it. We do there is a shot that we can get that at higher end. Mitchell Germain : Many thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead. Christopher Lucas : Good afternoon, everyone. Mike, just the question on the insurance recoveries related to litigation hasn't been any at least that I've seen in - reported in the Qs. What's the expectation in terms of the timing on something like that? Michael Bartolotta : We continue to work with our agents and our lawyers were working on that, but we've never given guidance on that. We collect them - and report them as we collect them. Christopher Lucas : Okay. And then, Glenn, on the office sales that you've mentioned earlier in the call, I think, it was Dallas, was that a - was it vacant but paying tenant in that building? Or what exactly - could you give us a little more color on that? Glenn Rufrano : Sure. That was a building in Plano, Texas. A good location, good building, 100% leased to Encana, the energy firm. Encana never occupied the building, but they sublet the building and actually had that building just beyond 90%. And so it's a good building, a little - the structure and the lease, for us with subtenants wasn't optimum. The buyer was some who had some land around that building, and by joining the land in the building, put together a nice property. And we think, we've got a very fair price. Christopher Lucas : And then, just shifting over to Cole quickly. I guess, I'm just wondering how you think about the pace of both the process for signing up new distribution agreements and then probably more importantly once they're signed, the pace to actually get these different platforms in the position where they have done their diligence and are actually able to sell the product. Is that - has that been occurring at a pace that you were comfortable with? Or it feels slow to me, but I'm just curious at how guys think about it. Glenn Rufrano : Well, it is slower than you or would like, I'd say, Chris, just listening to you. Because if we just take Cetera and Advisor Group, who terrific companies. They have a very diligent due diligence process. I am surprised actually at the extent, but I admire it. They make sure that not only is the advisor acceptable, but each of the products goes through due diligence. And for instance, as I mentioned, Cetera initially not only diligence stuff, but INAV. Then it took a while for them to go through CCPT V and CCIT III. They just got through that. Advisor Group started out with V and now it's moved on to INAV and it will take some time for them to diligence INAV and then diligence III, it's a process. And whether I think gets too long or too short, doesn't matter. It's a reasonable process and we will work with them and we'll get through it. Christopher Lucas : Okay. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Glenn Rufrano : Yeah. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks. Glenn Rufrano : We thank everybody for being with us this summer day and we look forward to speaking with you between now and the third quarter. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Milligan - Baird Michael Bilerman - Citi Collin Mings - Raymond James Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors Joshua Dennerlein - Bank of America Dan Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Nick Yulico - UBS Operator : Good day and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard, Vice President. Please go ahead. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s third quarter 2017 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with AFFO per share growth of approximately 7%. During the quarter, we completed $265 million of high quality acquisitions, while strengthening our balance sheet raising $444 million in common equity. We ended the quarter with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times, which is the highest it\u2019s been in our company\u2019s history. Given our active investment pipeline, we continued to expect to acquire approximately $1.5 billion in acquisitions this year. We are also reiterating our 2017 AFFO per share guidance of $3.03 to $3.07, which represents annual growth of 5.2% to 6.6%. Now, let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul Meurer : Thanks, John. I will provide some highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $10 million to $63 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the third quarter, following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds as well as a smaller gain on our interest rate swaps recognized this quarter as compared to that quarter last year. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 4.7% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, which is in line with our full year projection. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues are 1.8% in the quarter and our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.77 for the quarter versus $0.73 a year ago. Our 2017 FFO guidance remains $2.96 to $3.01 per share. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various non-cash items such as quarterly interest rate swaps, gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge we incurred in connection with the redemption for our Series F preferred stock back in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.77 per share for the quarter, representing a 6.9% increase over the year ago period. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $444 million in equity primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.7 times. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $1.3 million of debt coming due, the remainder of this year and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt to EBITDA ratio standing at 5.2 times. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Now, let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results. John Case : Thanks, Paul. I will begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3% unchanged versus the year ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017. During the quarter, we re-leased 79 properties recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is notably above our long-term average. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Year-to-date, we re-leased 181 properties, recapturing approximately 107% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,500 properties, with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that will re-lease. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents as we seldom incur tenant improvements and leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 1% during the quarter and for the year-to-date period, which is consistent with our projected run-rate for 2017. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 251 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We remain confident in the drugstore industry and speaking in 2010, the number of mail order prescriptions has declined each year and that has coincided with Walgreens positive pharmacy same-store sales growth for 18 consecutive quarters within our retail portfolio over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today\u2019s retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not have these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound, both the median and weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties, 2.7 times on a four-walled basis. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years. Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $265 million of acquisitions during the quarter at near record investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.7 billion in acquisition opportunities bringing us to $24.3 billion sourced year-to-date. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we have sourced. Our low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline, we are reiterating our 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1.5 billion. Now, I will hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions. Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2017, we invested $265 million in 56 properties located in 16 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.2 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 10% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 10 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are theaters, automotive services, and quick-service restaurants. We closed 13 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date 2017, we invested $957 million in 177 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 97% of the revenues are generated from retail and 3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 47 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, theaters and automotive services. Of the 50 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were about $50 million. With regard to transaction flow, it continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 49% of the volume sourced, were portfolios and 51% or approximately $12 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 40% for the third quarter. Of the $265 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 19% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 48-year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy averaging 263 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield that\u2019s our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Regarding dispositions, during the third quarter, we sold 17 properties for net proceeds of $25.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an un-levered IRR of 13.6%. This brings us to 45 properties sold year-to-date to $69 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an un-levered IRR of 10.9%. In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching a 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between $125 million and $175 million. With that, I would like to hand it back to John. John Case : Thanks, Sumit. We were active on the capital markets front in the third quarter issuing approximately $444 million in common equity at an average price to investors of approximately $58 per share. Our equity issuance activity during the quarter came through our ATM program of cost \u2013 this is a cost effective equity issuance allowed us to match fund our acquisitions activity and to prepay $175 million of our bonds that matured in September. We currently have approximately $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with the ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company. Last month, we increased the dividend for the 93rd time in the company\u2019s history. Our dividends year-to-date represent a 6% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We are proud to be one of only 5 REITs, S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company\u2019s financial position and operating performance and remain confident in the outlook for our business. Our real estate portfolio is performing well. Our acquisition pipeline is robust. Our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized. Our cost of capital remains a competitive advantage, we believe allows us to continue generating favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from R.J. Milligan with Baird. R.J. Milligan: Hey, good afternoon guys. Couple of quick questions. John, you mentioned the ATM issuance this quarter, I was just curious if you recall had some comments on sort of the thought process on issuing such a large amount on the ATM and whether or not you have changed the strategy or adjusted the strategy going forward in terms of match funding the acquisitions versus overnight offerings? John Case : RJ, that\u2019s good question. In the third quarter, we had an opportunity under favorable market conditions to match fund acquisitions and debt maturities. We were also able to save the shareholders about $17 million relative to what we would have had to pay in order to do an overnight offering. So, it worked out particularly well. Going forward, we will consider all forms of equity raising, so whether it be a regular way overnight offering, a marketed offering or additional ATM issuance activity. This was a heavy quarter for us on the ATM. We had, I\u2019d say, half of it was raised through regularly trading and about half of it was raised through reverse inquiry from high-quality institutional investors. So, we were pleased with the pricing. For the quarter, it was about $58 on a gross basis and it worked out well for us, but we will continue to look at all equity raising alternatives in the future. R.J. Milligan: Great, thanks. And then it looks like in the quarter on the acquisition side, you guys added to your AMC exposure and given some of the weakness that we have seen in the equity at AMC, just curious how you guys got comfortable with increasing your investment within theaters and within AMC specifically? John Case : Right. So, the equity performance is a bit divorced from the performance of our theaters. So, we are aware that the AMC stock has not traded well recently, but our properties and our theaters are performing quite well. We like the experiential nature of the theater business, and in particular, AMCs. It continues to be a low cost form of entertainment. As you know, the theaters have continued to upgrade their offerings with more comfortable seating and better technology and the full-service, higher quality food and beverage offerings. And as a result, they are seeing a rise in revenue. 2016 was a record year at the box office for the theater industry. So, it\u2019s tough comp year. Year-to-date, we are off about 5% from where we were at this time last year in terms of box office, but most industry experts believe we are going to see a strong fourth quarter as a number of big blockbusters such as Star Wars are released during the holiday. So, they expect the underperformance this year to turn a little bit and become a bit more favorable, but we are very happy with our theaters. The vast majority of our AMCs have been retrofitted with better seating, better technology and again, food and beverage offerings. So, where that\u2019s been done we have seen a 64% increase in revenues versus the pre-reconfiguration revenues for those AMCs. So it really comes down to picking the right properties having strong underwriting structures and we are pleased with that. Operator : We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Maybe sticking with theaters more specifically about underwriting the ones you bought in the quarter. I guess, how did you underwrite those from a rent coverage perspective certainly, where they are today and arguably I would assume rent coverages have declined during the year as box office has declined? And then how did you get comfortable, I know you talked a lot about the positives that a lot of theater operators are doing to their assets, but at some point premium video-on-demand is going to come and it\u2019s hard to imagine how that\u2019s not somewhat impactful to the four-walled profitability in the theater even if the exhibitors get hole. So, how do you get comfortable with the potential rent ultimately on renewal is what the exhibitors generating in those four-walls would be less? John Case : Well, got it. So we have seen on our theaters the rent coverage ratios actually improving and we underwrote these particular theaters that we acquired in the third quarter based on the strong cash flow coverages high-quality of real estate and the fact that they had been renovated. So, they were performing quite well with regard to the premium video-on-demand. There has been discussion in the sector to take it from potentially 90 days which is where it is today down to 45 days for release time. 95% of ticket sales are in the first 40 days after a movies theatrical release. So we don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a major impact on our theater business from the PVOD discussions that are taking place in addition theaters and studios are negotiating a revenue sharing arrangement with regard to that PVOD business. So that theater should be able to generate some incremental cash flow from that standpoint. So the as you know that the theaters typically have given their higher drop to breakeven higher drop in sales to breakeven they have lower coverage ratios. So something in the low 2s verses in our portfolio average or median which is at 2.8x, because they have more ability to control variable cost. So the coverages once again can be a bit lower. Michael Bilerman : Right. But the revenue sure that you talked about is will make the exhibiter whole it doesn\u2019t make the four-walled profitability whole of what they are generating in theaters? John Case : It does contribute to the credit worthiness of the tenant, because it is a source of additional revenues. Michael Bilerman : Right. But ultimately when they go to resign their lease at that location, the revenues that they can generate in the four walls arguably is less, but like if we are arguing that\u2019s about. John Case : Yes, I mean that\u2019s not been our experience in what we have seen. We have seen improving operating metrics on our portfolio theaters and we are comfortable with their performance. So, the fact that 95% of the ticket sales are in the first 45 days after release, we just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a material impact on our portfolio of theaters. Operator : We will take our next question from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Collin Mings : Hi, good afternoon. John Case : Hi, Collin. Collin Mings : First question from me just as far as the disposition guidance here implies a relatively active quarter here in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just discuss what\u2019s driving that any sort of revisions as far as from a guidance standpoint or things in the pipeline on the asset sale front? John Case : Sure. So, we have our dispositions guidance from the $125 million to $175 million for the quarter and that\u2019s notably above where we were earlier in the year and these are assets that we are selling that are non-strategic typically. We are taking the proceeds and redeploying them into investments that better fit our investment parameters. What\u2019s driving the increase this year or a couple of office sales that we expect to occur before year end as you know office is not a core product for us. We have acquired some office over the years in larger portfolio transactions and we look to reduce our office exposure. It is non-strategic and it has come down a bit, but we expect it to come down more with these office sales. So, again primarily a couple of office buildings that we plan to sell by year end are driving the upward adjustment and the disposition guidance. Collin Mings : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe just sticking with that idea of some asset sales just recognizing there is obviously some unique characteristics about your industrial bucket, but can you maybe just update us on the opportunities there may potentially recycle some capital there, particularly just given the current environment and potentially some better yielding opportunities on the retail front? John Case : Yes. We like the industrial business. It\u2019s primarily distribution close to 70% of it is related to e-commerce activities on what\u2019s happened it\u2019s a business we would like to grow. What\u2019s happened is that that it\u2019s become incredibly competitive and pricey. So, we haven\u2019t aggressively grown that business this year given just the lofty pricing. We kind of stepped back from being more aggressive on that front. It\u2019s not a business we want to sell and liquidate long-term. We like the prospects and we like the investments that we are in. So, we will continue to look and review at acquisition opportunities in that sector and we hope to find some where the risk-adjusted reward, risk-adjusted returns are a bit more favorable than what we have seen in this frothy industrial market here over the last 6 to 9 months. Operator : Our next question will go to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks. So, just a couple of quick specific questions, just on Gander Mountain, can you update us how many stores do you have vacant currently and plans to maybe re-lease them or sell them? John Case : Sure. On Gander, first of all, Gander represented less than 0.5% of our overall rents. So, it was not a very material issue for us. That being said, we had 9 locations, of which Camping World was interested in the vast majority of those locations. However, they were seeking rent reductions that didn\u2019t make sense for us given the quality of the real estate. So, 8 of the 9 locations we are marketing to national retailers at what we believe will be more favorable rates from quite strong tenants than what was being offered by Camping World. So, it\u2019s a conscious decision for us to take these assets and go to market with them and we think we will have a better outcome in terms of recovering our pre-bankruptcy rent. Historically, the company has recovered 82% of the pre-bankruptcy rent on the bankruptcies we have been involved in. We think we will do that well or better with regard to the Gander portfolio. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just on the same-store rental revenue growth, you highlighted the industry\u2019s healthcare or health and fitness childcare C-store that drove the majority of the increase, can you maybe talk about sort of at the other end the offsets which sectors did you see maybe weaker growth? John Case : Yes. Well in this quarter in this quarter, we had the shoe industry which we have a very minor position in, but that contributed to put negative pressure on the same-store rent growth. Going forward, I think it will continue to move around a bit, but we do feel good about health and fitness and C-stores continuing to help drive positive same-store rent growth. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott : Hey, guys. Quick question for you, John, on pharmacy, I know you guys have a positive view of the space and the numbers look pretty good. Just a question if Amazon does get into the business in a material way, I think literally while we are on the call, there was an article that came out saying they got licenses approved for 12 states or something like that, so, just curious your long-term thoughts on the states if Amazon does try to crack the code on this particular business? John Case : Yes. Of course it\u2019s something we have been considering and discussing and analyzing for quite sometime now. First of all, we are invested in the three most significant players in the pharmacy market with Walgreens, CVS and then Rite-Aid. We have high quality real estate. We have got companies that are affiliated with pharmacy benefit managers, which drive high market shares. So, there are barriers to entry here. They have well-developed retail and distribution that helps give them a competitive advantage and creates barriers to entry. One thing we have looked at it since 2010 we have looked at how mail order pharmacies have performed relative to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. And since 2010, the prescriptions dispensed through mail order pharmacies have declined by 20% and most of that has been picked up by the Walgreens and CVS\u2019 of the world. In addition, the regulation in the drugstore industry will make it difficult we believe for Amazon to penetrate easily this sector. So, if you look at \u2013 if you look at the customers or pharmacies you will see that many of them are on short-term \u2013 shorter term prescriptions and of the baby boom generation maybe the older generation and they like to have the face-to-face consultation with the pharmacist. So, often, they prefer picking their prescriptions up in person and having a discussion with the expert on side effects or other issues related to their drugs. So, that\u2019s something that I think bodes well for the brick-and-mortar business. And Walgreens as all of this is played out and you are probably aware of this, Walgreens\u2019 U.S. pharmacy same-store sales growth has been positive for the last 18 consecutive quarters. So they are doing quite well. Michael Knott : Right. Thanks for that. And then my other question will just be \u2013 just on the watch list, I know you said it was basically unchanged from where it\u2019s been in the past, but I guess more of a cycle question than a realty income specific portfolio type question, but just curious if you feel the need to position yourself a little bit more defensively to set the margin from a credit standpoint at this point in the cycle or weather sort of seems like continued sunshiny days out there? John Case : Yes. Well, we continue to experience levels on the watch list in the low 1% area. The portfolio is performing well. I think that\u2019s evidenced by re-leasing spreads by our continued high occupancy. Our portfolio has performed well with regard to the impact of e-commerce. Our properties have \u2013 on the retail side over 90% having service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component. Of the 22 retail bankruptcies this year, 19 have not had any of those characteristics. So, our type of real estate so far has proven to be pretty resilient to what is recognized as the most significant potential disruptor and that is e-commerce. So, we do not \u2013 portfolio is performing well and we really don\u2019t need to shift into a more defensive posture right now. Operator : We will go now to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : Hi thank you. I thought Walgreen plans to close about 600 drugstores with the acquisition of 2000 stores from Rite Aid. Do you know if any of those stores are in your portfolio or how we should think about that? John Case : Yes. So, we don\u2019t \u2013 we have been in dialogue with Walgreens, but of the 1900 they will be purchasing 1900 Rite Aids and that should close in the spring of 2018. We have 15 Rite Aid stores within a 2-mile radius of a Walgreen store and what Walgreens has indicated is the majority of their store closings are going to be former Rite Aids. Our Rite Aids that are within that 2-mile radius of Walgreens have an average lease term remaining of 9 years and Walgreens even if they close those stores will be responsible for lease payments for 9 more years on those stores. So, I don\u2019t think it will have a material impact on us and based on our preliminary discussions we are not hearing that it will. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay, thank you. And my other question, the wildfires impact \u2013 the wildfires in California did they impact the treasury line of states liner in your portfolio at all? John Case : They did not. There is no material impact, tragic event. Our hearts go out to the people who were affected out there and we wish them the very best in the recovery efforts. And I would also say that about Irma, Harvey and Maria as well, but on the real estate front, we did not have any material impact to our portfolio from any of those unfortunate events. Operator : Our next question will go to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Dan Donlan : Thank you and good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to Gander and unit your decision to try to release those procedures seldom take in our printer negotiations with Gander I mean it is very high confidence level in this 80% and just kind of curious how you think about CapEx in regard to these boxes timeframe you know your setting for yourselves on that? John Case : Yes we have a high degree of confidence in our asset management team did a thorough analysis of what was being proposed by Gander versus what we were hearing talking to other national leading retail tenants so we think that come out better that\u2019s why we made the decision we think our retention rate in terms of rent is going to be as I said equal or higher than our historical rate of 82% now this will play out over a couple quarters a couple these properties are much closer to being inked up than others but we have five that we think are going to happen pretty quickly and the remainder I will take a little bit more time but even when you factor in the time value aspect of that analysis you were better off you went camping world was proposing so it\u2019s the right economic decision for the company and for the shareholders. Dan Donlan : Okay, understood in an image, keeping with that, I just went back and looked at your vacant asset sales of last 24 months and it seems that you are averaging about 1% of the portfolio in terms of lease on a trailing 12 basis he sold 50 of the last 2012 and then prior 12 months that you sold about 56 so I am just curious how do you see that trending over time is there certain portion of the portfolio that for whatever reason these assets are vacant your deciding to sell is that portion the portfolio would be opposite moving down I am just kind of curious and why the how those things going to trend in the future if there\u2019s something specific to maybe the last two years or for something specific to Mason the legacy assets that you required before 2000 whatever it may have been? John Case : Yes, I mean I think we\u2019ll continue to see this trend 4, 5 years ago we started more actively managing the portfolio to optimize its overall performance. So what we get you don\u2019t want to do is keep on the books nonstrategic assets that are potentially creating a drag for the company are creating a drag when we can take that capital and reinvested into properties that are higher quality and meet our investment parameters that being said on these vacant asset sales we\u2019re generating unlevered IRRs of roughly 10% or so. So these have been profitable investment is just that there they become a bit obsolete in some cases or maybe the real estate markets surrounding these assets have changed maybe that that the most logical uses for the market don\u2019t make sense anymore. So I would expect us to continue to sell that what I would say vacant the other vacant assets that are and no longer strategic to our investment philosophy. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I think, I heard you say this but what would the AMCs that you purchased are they fully amenitize of food and alcohol and then when you compare those to the rest of the existing portfolio and I guess it was the AMC portfolio how to they run some coverages compare and how much of the existing portfolio is fully amenetized? John Case : So the portfolio we purchased yes it was fully amenitize had strong rent coverages. The vast majority of our AMCs had been retrofitted and are there new version and therefore have experience that uptick and overall revenues per theater. So these we believe, we see plenty of theaters and these are of the of the highest quality there in the top quartile of performance for all of AMCs portfolio. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then appreciate some of the color on cap rates you guys have given, but can you just comment on kind of specifically cap rate movement for suburban and rural big-box locations maybe over the past 18 months and investment grade or non-investment grade? John Case : Sumit, you want to take that. Sumit Roy : Sure. So most of our investments with regards to big-box falls into what John described as our retail strategy and a very small few approximately 50 off all of the big boxes that don\u2019t fall into a service low price point nondiscretionary element of retail they are with tenants such as Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s et cetera, tenants that we are very, very comfortable with. And what we found in discussions with our tenants that these are assets that are continue to perform well even post our acquisitions, so we have very comfortable with the portfolio that we currently have with regards to big-box. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Neil Malkin : Hi, guys good afternoon. Sorry if I missed but the spreads or the cap rates acquisitions were a good bit higher than they\u2019ve been the last several quarters the function of mix in the asset you purchased or and what kind of to that phenomenon? John Case : Yes, the spreads were in the third quarter about 260 basis points, which is at the high-end of our range year-to-date we\u2019re running that about 05 to 10, so it was primarily a result of having higher yields. In the third quarter on the acquisitions and we had a favorable [indiscernible] cost of while cost of capital during the quarter as well, so it\u2019s a combination \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of the 2. So the theater transaction, which represented a large component of what we did in the third quarter you had a higher cap rate which help drive the overall higher cap rate for the third quarter. Neil Malkin : Got it. And then this was all the things are kind of going on with drug stores are you seeing or is it too soon seller expectation change or are you may be changing the way you kind of look at risk to you incremental drug store acquisitions just given the sort of the new things that are coming authentic competition e-commerce, or changing demographics what have you? John Case : We are comfortable with our drugstore exposure we are at 10.8% of rental revenues for drug stores so we as we say we don\u2019t want any single industry being much more than the low single double digits in terms of what it represents as a percent of our overall rental revenue and then Walgreens our largest drugstore tenant is 6.6% of rental revenues and we are comfortable with that exposure that being said we are not looking to yet we want to remain diversified that created a lot of stability and cunning de-risk our portfolio for the company so we are not looking to materially add to your overall drugstore exposure nor the Walgreens exposure we are comfortable with where we are. Operator : We take our next question from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi, thanks. Most recent balancing questions. So, I guess for Paul you have got a bond in a term loan maturing in January you have historically issued bonds when the longer-term side but do a whole in your debt maturity schedule in 2020 because the coupons in the debt maturities are fairly low in 2% range would you consider going little shorter term and revise? Paul Meurer : While in general our philosophy remains the same which is generally speaking longer-term unsecured bonds as part of a liability structure but ultimately we look at our debt maturity schedule over time and when there\u2019s holes there we do take advantage of those we think a laddered maturities schedule is prudent relative to how we lay out our maturities and point out there\u2019s a couple gaps out there one of which is obviously 2025 which would speak to the potential for seven-year bonds and then certainly everything is available kind of thereafter overall we look at the maturity schedule and think about what in each of those buckets how much and as such you know you could see us do anything you know from 5 years to 7 years to 10 years to 12 to 20 to 30 were constantly looking at what all the alternatives are and always want to keep our options open as it relates to that you will see us lean towards the unsecured market you know and dealing with institutional bond investors and we got a lot of interest from bond investors at a really all maturities across the curve. Todd Stender : That\u2019s helpful. And then with the equity raise in Q3 to help with your year lobbying for a higher credit rating and they range in one of the rating agencies holding out for at this point? Paul Meurer : Well the rating agencies are conducting their own analysis and they are not previewing any of that with us we think we posted it another strong quarter here operationally is currently the balance sheet is in excellent shape so you will see what they come back with. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Well thanks for the Rite Aid stores that you do own I mean at this point of those 69 properties have any of those are the ones that are being sold to Walgreens? John Case : We don\u2019t know precisely in our preliminary discussions it looks like the range could be anywhere from about 10 to 30 stores but that\u2019s preliminary and that could change one thing we like is that Rite Aid is going to use the proceeds from the sale nearly $5 billion including the termination fee from the original merger to improve its balance sheet Rite Aid is going to take its debt EBITDA from 7.5x down approximately 4.5x and they are also going to have access to Walgreens purchasing network and Rite Aid it will be more focused on the West Coast as they saw more of what they sell to Walgreens that\u2019s going to be along the Eastern Seaboard which will allow Walgreens to fully develop its footprint there. So I think it\u2019s a win-win, Walgreens comes out with significant synergies they\u2019re expecting have maybe up to 400 million in synergies from this transaction in the first 3 to 4 years and they have a bigger footprint and they\u2019re more efficient company and then Rite Aid is still the third largest player more focused out west with a much better balance sheet. So we\u2019re pleased with the outcome of this asset sale even though they couldn\u2019t get the full merger approved by the FTC. Nick Yulico : Okay. And I know it doesn\u2019t show up as a top 10 of yours, but you have exposure to Fred\u2019s? John Case : Yes, we don\u2019t talk about, we don\u2019t talk about tenants outside our top 20 but Fred\u2019s is now, we don\u2019t have\u2026 Nick Yulico : Okay. So you don\u2019t have any exposure to Fred? John Case : No, no. Nick Yulico : Okay. We trying to get a sense for what give your blended coverage on retail, but what is the coverage like for your pharmacy exposure is it meaningfully different is it lower than are you reported here for overall retail? John Case : It\u2019s right at the average or the median. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. John Case : Thanks, Don and we appreciate everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT in a few weeks. Take care. Have a good afternoon. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the VEREIT Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Bonni Rosen : Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2017 fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 2 :00 PM Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529 with the confirmation code of 10116308. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT\u2019s actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the yearly report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today\u2019s call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly and year-end financial results. Glenn will then discuss 2018 guidance and we will conclude today\u2019s call by opening the line for questions. Glenn, let me turn the call over to you. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, Bonni, and thanks for joining our call. For the year, we met or exceeded the core components of our 2017 targets. We hit the high-end of our AFFO guidance range, with the real estate components at $0.70. Acquisitions totaled $746 million and we completed $575 million of dispositions. Our balance sheet is strong. We improved our maturity schedule and our net debt to normalized EBITDA is 5.7 times providing capacity. We received an investment grade rating for the company from S&P and Moody\u2019s and along with Fitch, all three rating agencies have us had investment grade. And after reestablishing the brand of Cole Capital, we announced the sale simplifying our business model. We\u2019re pleased with the operations for the year with occupancy ending at 98.8%. Same-store rent was flat, which includes 0.3% due to the impact of our early lease renewal efforts. In 2017, we had 2.5 million square feet of leasing activity, of which 1.5 million square feet were early renewals. Notable transactions included 1.1 million square feet of office and industrial leases and 92,000 square feet of bank branches. Of the early renewals, we recaptured 91% of the prior rents. These leases have built in increases and we have extended the weighted average lease maturity to 11.6 years. For the 2017 renewals, we recaptured 99% of prior rent, with additional rent increases over the lease term. Our portfolio diversification was further enhanced, as we implemented our calling process. At year-end, property tax diversification was 41% retail, 22% restaurants, 17% industrial, and office just under 20%. As you can see, we are within our target range of 15% to 20% for office, and Red Lobster was reduced to 6.5%, which is down from 12% when we first initiated our business plan. Our top 10 tenants represent 28.3%, which is among the lowest concentration in the industry. We have a number of long-term diversification guidelines, no tenant greater than 5%, no industry or geography greater than 10%, investment grade tenants between 30% and 40%, and weighted average lease terms approximately 10 years. 2017 total commercial real estate transactions in the U.S. were $481 billion, down from $512 billion in 2016. Yet, we found our pipeline of transaction continued on pace with $22 billion of real estate offered to us. With that as a background, we purchased $294 million of assets during the fourth quarter, bringing 2,017 acquisitions to $746 million. Our program focused on retail and industrial credits with long-term business plans to manage through the current secular trends. Our retail focus continues to be off-price in e-commerce resistant sectors represented by tenants such as Hobby Lobby, LAFitness and Tractor Supply. As well as brands, we believe will continue to provide value to customers long-term, such as Bass Pro Cabela\u2019s. Our industrial criteria emphasizes location, functionality and appropriate tenancy as represented by Best Buy and Michaels distribution centers. $86 million of our assets were sold in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for 2017 to $575 million. These continue to be very targeted to our diversifiers, Red Lobster and office in addition to non-core. For the year, our sales provided a gain of $65 million. And since our business plan in 2015, we have sold $3.2 billion of a gain of $206 million. As reported, we completed the sale of Cole on February 1. With the reestablishment of the brand, the sale itself is based on the changing industry and our ability to simplify our business plan, our business model with more straightforward reporting, streamlined operating process, less fiduciary responsibility and a more predictable set of financial expectations. Before Mike reviews our financial results, let me provide a brief update on litigation. The Court held a conference in December to discuss depositions, which started after the 1st of this year and could last through the year. The Court scheduled the next Status Conference for June 11, 2018. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-K filed today. Let me now turn over the call to Mike. Michael Bartolotta : Thanks, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. Now with the sale of Cole has been accomplished, we will have more simplified financial reporting, and you will see our main real estate operations as continuing operations and Cole as discontinued operations. We finished the year on plan achieving AFFO of $0.74 per diluted share with $0.70 coming from continuing operations. As we outlined in our earnings release, we will focus on continuing operations for this call. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased $10.1 million to $316.6 million as we moved to being a net acquirer. The net loss was $2.5 million versus net income of $12.5 million last quarter. The $15 million decrease was mostly the result of higher impairment charges, G&A and appreciation along with our Q4 loss on the extinguishment of debt versus a gain in Q3. These were partially offset by higher revenue and a gain on the disposition of real estate in Q4. FFO and AFFO per diluted share were roughly flat for the quarter at $0.17 and $0.18, respectively, in each period. G&A was up $5.1 million to $18.3 million versus $13.2 million for the third quarter, mostly due to year-end compensation-related items. Full-year G&A was $58.6 million and we expect G&A for 2018 to be between $65 million and $68 million. The increase is predominantly due to cost previously included in the Cole Capital segment of which approximately 50% represents equity compensation. Recurring CapEx was $21.7 million for the year, which was lower than our anticipated range of $30 million to $35 million. Some of the capital spend will spill over into 2018. Given the spillover, our 2018 estimate for recurring CapEx is $30 million to $35 million. The average of the 2016 to 2018 CapEx is about $20 million to $25 million. Legal costs related to the matters arising from the audit committee investigation, which are included in litigation and other non-routine costs were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount of $49.4 million. Our estimate for 2018 gross legal cost is $55 million to $65 million, excluding any insurance proceeds. Turning to our fourth quarter real estate activity, the company purchased 23 properties for $293.5 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.8%. Acquisitions totaled $745.6 million for the year at an average cash cap rate of 6.9%. Subsequent to the quarter, the company purchased six properties for $66.3 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.9%. During the quarter, we disposed of 25 properties and a land parcel owned by an unconsolidated joint venture for $85.6 million, at an average cash cap rate of 7.6%, which included a number of non-core office properties. Dispositions totaled $574.9 million for the year at an average cash cap rate of 7.1%. And subsequent to the quarter, the company disposed the seven properties for an aggregate sales price of $57.4 million, at an average cash cap rate of 7%. In addition, we have $22 million bank portfolio under our contract. We have continued to strengthen the balance sheet and the maturity schedule. In August, we issued $600 million of 3.95% 10-year bonds at an issue price of 99.33% of par value. Proceeds from this offering were used to redeem our $500 million term loan and the remaining proceeds were used to repay secured debt. This further laddered our maturity schedule and extended our duration. As of the end of the year, we had drawn $185 million on our revolving line of credit leaving $2.1 billion of capacity. We will continue to use our line of credit as part of our capital allocation strategy. And during the fourth quarter, we reduced secured debt by $31.6 million. We paid down $579.9 million of secured debt for the year. Any secured debt coming due in 2018 is expected to eventually be termed out with unsecured debt. Our net debt to normalized EBITDA was 5.7 times, up slightly from 5.5 times in Q3. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remained healthy at 3.1 times and our net debt to gross real estate investments ratio was 39%. Our unencumbered asset ratio was 73% and the weighted average duration of our debt was 4.3 years. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Glenn. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll now turn to guidance for 2018. AFFO per share between $0.70 and $0.72; net debt to EBITDA of approximately 6 times; real estate operations with average occupancy about 98%; the same-store rental growth ranging from 0.3% to 1%; dispositions totaling $300 million to $500 million; and cap rate ranging from 6.5 to 7.5, targeting our continued diversification categories, restaurant, office as well as non-core. Acquisition guidance is $200 million to $300 million in excess of dispositions funded through a combination of internal equity, debt capacity and proceeds from the sale of Cole. Properties are expected to be in the cap rate range of 6.5 to 7.5 and will be considered based upon their portfolio enhancing qualities. Our acquisition program within the balance sheet guidelines and the $200 million authorized share repurchase plan could be interchangeable with respect to real estate assets or the company stock. We\u2019re in a period where capital market conditions are causing volatility in REITsharesin the face of generally good economic and market fundamentals. Over the past three years, the market has been more stable and we have taken advantage of that stability to reinforce our portfolio, strengthen and make more liquid our balance sheet and with the sale of Cole simplify the business. Our talented management team has experienced through various market cycles and we\u2019ll continue to focus on our business objectives. I\u2019ve now been here three years, and I\u2019m committed to continue the progress we\u2019ve made and as such, have renewed my contract for an additional three years. With that, we\u2019ll open the phone to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good afternoon. Glenn, your share still traded at meaningful discount to the net lease sector. Cole Capital was a major move to help simplify VEREIT. What is \u2013 what other levers do you think VEREIT has to pull to close the discount? Glenn Rufrano : Well, Sheila, we \u2013 as you certainly understood following us, we had a number of impediments as we started building the company back to where it is today. And we have one left litigation and we understand and know that causes some discount. We\u2019ve operated well in the last three years. As a company, you can only manage litigation and we are managing the litigation. Our goal is to continue to operate well, continue to prove that we have improved the portfolio. We have acquisition capabilities and run the portfolio well. If we do that, we will be rewarded. What we will not do is something stupid that I will guarantee you. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And then I know you\u2019re very limited on what you can say on litigation, but you mentioned the date June 11. I was wondering, if you could tell \u2013 remind us or give us a little more detail what that is? And also how we should think about insurance covering litigation costs in 2018? Glenn Rufrano : The \u2013 it\u2019s just a reference point for the folks to get back together. As we mentioned, we initiated depositions and it would be a Status Conference primarily dedicated to that. That\u2019s what the June date is all about, Sheila. In terms of insurance, we continue to work with insurance. We have \u2013 had a lawsuit, which is preventing insurance to be paid right now. We do expect that to be settled at a reasonable \u2013 in a reasonable timeframe. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. Thank you. Glenn Rufrano : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey, good evening, everyone. Glenn Rufrano : Hi. Joshua Dennerlein : I\u2019m curious about your plans for the 2018 convertible notes and also that notes coming due in 2019 and where you think you could issue 10-year debt today? Michael Bartolotta : Sure, Josh, it\u2019s Mike. I mean, we \u2013 if you take a look at what we have over the next two years, we now have $185 million outside on the line, and that line technically comes due 6/30 of 2018 with a one-year extension capability. We\u2019ve got $597 million of those 3% converts that come due in August 1st of 2018 and then we have the $750 million of the 3% unsecured notes that mature on \u2013 in February of 2019. What we\u2019re currently doing is working with our banking group. And obviously, one of the things we can do is renew our line and have the $2.3 billion revolver there available to help absorb some of this. And obviously, we have no problem going back out to the debt markets to issue notes. I think today if we were to issue notes, we would be somewhere in the neighborhood of roughly 4.6% to 4.7% on the 10-year and something less on the less \u2013 on something less as far as that goes. I think, we will probably be working with our banks potentially to do our recap. And as we were to do a recap, that would allow us in our likelihood to do a deferred draw that would allow us to take care of the first convertible note coming due in 2018. And we would then work with our banks, as well as the market to see what we wanted to do with the February 19 that towards the end of this year. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. Glenn Rufrano : And as you know, you could see in the summer, Mike and his team recapped $600 million. I think piteously, we beat some of this increase to free up this line that makes this next financing much easier. Joshua Dennerlein : Got it. Thanks, guys. That\u2019s it for me. Glenn Rufrano : Thank you. Operator : And next, we have a follow-up question from Sheila McGrath. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Just in terms of stock buyback and capital allocation towards acquisitions, if you could just give us a little bit of insight on how you\u2019re thinking about acquisitions versus buyback? Glenn Rufrano : Sure. First, Sheila, we in May of this year announced $200 million of buyback as you remember, and we watched the markets very closely and we bought about 69,000 shares, not much. I think that was good. As we look at our stock today, we understand the discount. We see the cost of capital in the market versus the cost of capital in buying shares. We\u2019re very analytical in that process. And we will use the appropriate risk return relationship to consider both acquisitions stock or assets. The difference though I would point out is, we are always looking to improve our portfolio. So an asset acquisition has to improve the portfolio, where a stock acquisition may be a better risk, but we are going to be looking towards debt. We are not going to move out of our debt guidance either \u2013 in either buying stock and/or assets. Sheila McGrath : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then most of your acquisitions, I think, recently have been more retail and industrial-oriented. Just your thoughts on the office portfolio longer-term with this, do you think this would ever be considered non-core, and you would divest office, or just your long-term thoughts on office? Glenn Rufrano : Sure. But to your point, you\u2019re right, Sheila, for the year, we bought the $746 million, 57% was retail, 43% was industrial. So those were the two property types that we purchased. We are continuing to take down our office portfolio, we\u2019re about 19.6, and we\u2019ll take it down a bit more, because we want to be within guidelines, which we think makes sense. In terms of the total diversification of the company, we do believe in diversification. We do believe that having different property types can make sense. And it can make sense, because not only are you diversifying risk, you provide the opportunity at the appropriate time to buy the right property type. So as of now, we\u2019re not considering exiting the office market. We\u2019re considering bringing it down somewhat. But at some point, it may provide an opportunity for us. And we\u2019ve continually said, we\u2019re not smart enough to know at any given time, which property type is in or out. And in our business, our business model, which is to provide equity to corporate America, we have the infrastructure to manage and lease all four of these property types that infrastructure value is important to us and we will continue consider diversification. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And one last question. Just on the Cole disposition, I think, it was meaningful in terms of simplifying VEREIT. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us like longer-term after all the moving pieces are gone. Incrementally, will that sale have a positive impact on G&A for VEREIT before and after Cole if we kind of compare? Glenn Rufrano : Sure. I\u2019ll let Mike start that. Michael Bartolotta : Sure. I mean, I think, we\u2019ve indicated just now that our increase in G&A that we mentioned of about $8 million is due to the Cole transaction. We will \u2013 even now with that increase of \u2013 which puts us in a range of $66 million in G&A. We have about 4% of our assets in G&A and about 5.3% of our revenue. And that\u2019s compared to a peer group of about 0.5% and about 6.7%. That being said, we were never going to be comfortable with having the large increase in G&A, and we will always work towards having the most efficient operation. It\u2019s hard to tell today given that we just disclosed the transaction where we come out beyond 2019. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Thank you. Glenn Rufrano : Thank you. Operator : And next, we have a question from Chris Lucas of Capital One. Chris Lucas : Good afternoon, everybody. Hey, Glenn, I think, initially, when you laid out your sort of plan for the company when you joined, one of the items that you were looking at was eliminating flat leases as part of the portfolio, or at least reducing that. You\u2019re still at 21% of ABR and flat leases. what\u2019s the thought on your exposure there? is that \u2013 I know that\u2019s \u2013 a lot of that relates to sort of investment grade-rated tenants? But just curious as to how you think about that pool of assets relative to the overall portfolio? Glenn Rufrano : We have tried hard for it. We were at 25%. We\u2019re now down to 21%. And just to give you a sense, we had sold $715 million of flat leases since we started. But we\u2019re working with denominator effects here. And that\u2019s the reason it hasn\u2019t come down as much as we\u2019d like. We want to be in that range. But your other point is important, because a good question would be, why have any? Frankly, we\u2019d like to have none, but we are always matching investment grade. So we\u2019ll match the two. But for our balance sheet, as we said right in the beginning in our business plan, we\u2019d rather take a flat lease, sell it at good price and put that money back into the balance sheet to work, and that\u2019s still our position and we\u2019re going to bring it down to that 15% to 20% range. Chris Lucas : Okay, thanks. And then going back to the question that Sheila asked, as it relates to sort of the transition with Cole, I guess, the question I have is that, so the sale closes mid-quarter going forward the rest of the year for the quarterly results. Are there transition overhangs as it relates to G&A that we should be thinking about, or other sort of dual efforts that sort of inflate the current expectations for G&A relative to sort of what the clean run rate will look like going forward in 2019 and beyond? Michael Bartolotta : I\u2019ll start that one. Basically, Chris, it\u2019s the $8 million. I think, if you want to think about overhang, it\u2019s roughly that $8 million that I mentioned that is the increase over the existing run rate of G&A for the continuing operations. That that\u2019s the overhang that we have right now that we\u2019ll need to deal with as as we move forward. Glenn Rufrano : And, Chris, the part of the transition agreement allows us as we\u2019re moving to lower people count. It allows us to reduce any other slippage. That number is the primary number that we\u2019ll be working towards to reduce. Chris Lucas : Okay, great. Thank you. Glenn Rufrano : Thank you. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks. Glenn Rufrano : We thank, everybody, for joining us today, and look forward to another good year. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s first quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Forms 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We're pleased to begin the year with another successful quarter. During the first quarter, we invested $510 million in high quality property acquisitions and now over 50% of our rental revenue was generated from investment grade rated tenants. Our focus on quality is also reflected in our portfolio occupancy, which is 98.6%, our highest quarter en occupancy in more than 10 years. We reached this occupancy level, while achieving our seventh consecutive quarter of positive recapture spreads on properties released. We remain confident in the outlook for our business and are reiterating our 2018 AFFO per share guidance of $3.14 to $3.20, which represents annual growth of about 3% to 5%. Let me hand it over to Paul now to provide some additional detail on our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks, John. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Interest expense in the quarter was flat despite a higher outstanding debt balance. This was largely due to the $2.3 million preferred dividend expense we recognized in the comparative quarter a year ago when we announced the redemption of our Series F preferred stock. Additionally, we recognized the larger interest rate swap gain this quarter, which has the effect of decreasing interest expense. Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.1% for the quarter. We continued to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018. Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.7% for the quarter and we expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.79 for the quarter, representing 11.3% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Note that in the first quarter of last year, we recognized a $13.4 million non-cash charge related to the early redemption of our Series F preferred stock. As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the NAREIT redefined FFO definitions. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was also $0.79 per share for the quarter, representing a 3.9% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In early April, we issued $500 million in seven-year fixed rate unsecured bonds at a yield of 3.96%. The offering allowed us to term out our borrowings on our revolving credit facility and they fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we had no other maturities in 2025. Pro forma for the bond offering, the weighted average maturity of our bond is approximately 9.5 years, which is nearly three years longer than it was at the start of 2017. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with less than $80 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $21 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver and our maturity schedule is very well latter thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our first quarter acquisitions, is currently 5.6 times and our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6 times. So, in summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics. Now, let me turn the call back over to John. John Case : Thanks, Paul. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. As I mentioned earlier, occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to be just north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter, we re-leased 55 properties, recapturing just over 100% of the expiring rent, which is consistent with our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2700 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Going to dispositions, we continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. During the quarter, we sold $14 million of non-strategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of 7.3% and a cap rate or leased property sales of 6.6%. We\u2019re increasing in our estimate for dispositions from $75 million to $100 million to approximately $200 million for 2018. Our same store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant and history, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties re-leased to 254 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue and in the first quarter, drugstores was our largest industry at 10.5% of rental revenue. We're pleased with the strength of our portfolio, which continues to perform well, especially relative to other types of retail portfolios, which had faced more significant challenges due to e-commerce pressures. Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate successfully in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent US retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This represents the highest investment grade exposure in our portfolio\u2019s history. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for retail properties is 2.8 times on a four wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years. Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $510 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.2% cap rate. Virtually, all in the QSR and C-store industries. As a reminder, we disclose cash cap rates as opposed to GAAP cap rates. We estimate our GAAP acquisition cap rates would be about 0.5% higher. We were pleased with the quality of our first quarter acquisitions as 85% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade rated tenants. During the quarter, we completed a significant sale leaseback transaction with 7-Eleven who is now our fifth largest tenant, representing approximately 3.5% of rent. 7-Eleven is the top global convenience store operator and provides very strong credit with an S&P rating of AA-. We previously partnered with 7-Eleven for their first sale leaseback transaction in 2016 and are pleased to continue the relationship. This transaction was done on a off-market basis and reflects the benefits afforded to us due to our size, as we are the only net lease REIT able to execute on an investment of this scale without creating tenant and history concentration issues. These properties are newer vintage and located in highly trafficked markets with significant population density. The average size of these properties is in excess of 4000 square feet and about two-thirds of the properties operate a quick service restaurant concept within the convenience store. In addition to the quality of the real estate, we are pleased with the structure of this transaction, which carries an average lease term of 16 years and rent growth well in excess of our portfolio average with rents in lined with market rents. Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced 9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring 5% of the amount sourced. Our investment spreads in the first quarter move closer to our historical average as a result of the high quality of the properties and the strong credit profile of the tenants as well as higher capital costs. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline in the current market environment, we continue to estimate 2018 acquisition volume to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion. I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions in a bit more detail now. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2018, we invested 510 million in 174 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14 years. On revenue basis, approximately 85% of the total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 16 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy of the opportunity source during the first quarter, 54% for portfolios and 46% or approximately 4.4 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 23% for the first quarter. Of the 510 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 5% were one-off transactions. As to pricing cap rates, we\u2019re essentially unchanged in the first quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter, which were just under our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield, less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. As John mentioned, during the quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of 13.8 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.3%. In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and revise disposition volume of approximately 200 million. John? John Case : We continue to monitor the capital markets to fund our business. The pricing of our April bond offering, which Paul referenced reflects the benefits of having the highest credit rating in the net lease sector. We're well positioned to fund our growth for the remainder of the year as a result of our conservative balance sheet management over recent years. We have no bond maturities until 2021 and our senior unsecured notes and bonds have a weighted average remaining term of approximately 9.5 years. We currently have about $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. In March, we increased the dividend for the 96th time in our company\u2019s history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%. We\u2019re proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index.  To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's performance to start the year and remain optimistic for the remainder of 2018. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question now from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : I guess first off, just a question on the disposition guidance going up. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're looking to sell? John Case : Sure. Just like last year, when initially we guided the dispositions for the year, 75 million to 100 million, we did the same thing this year, but as the year goes along, we uncover opportunities to sell non-strategic assets and we've had a couple of conversations that have led us to believe we think we're going to be closer to 200 million in dispositions. The types of assets are non-strategic. There's a casual dining portfolio included in that and some additional Piazzi stores and a few other types, but they're largely non-strategic and they're factored in to our guidance, even though they're a bit dilutive. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then second question is on industrial. You've previously talked about looking to grow that exposure. I'm wondering how much of the pipeline build as you looked at in the first quarter was industrial and with the M&A that's happened in that sector of late, how is the pricing there for us that's been affected, affecting your ability to still be able to buy industrial? Can you make deals work versus where you see your cost of capital? John Case : Yeah. That's a good question, Nick. About 20% of the transactions we sourced in the first quarter were industrial properties and even though the 10-year treasury has risen by 50 basis points this year more or less, we've seen industrial cap rates continue to tick down by roughly 25 basis points. So it's been quite challenging for us to grow that part of the business and that's why none of our acquisitions in the first quarter were industrial properties. That being said, given the activity in that sector, it does reinforce the views we have regarding the strength of that portfolio, just under $3 billion on our balance sheet. So we're pleased to have it, but at these pricing levels, it would be challenging to grow significantly, given our current cost of capital. Operator : We\u2019ll move and take our next question from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : You\u2019ve talked about how you could fund your investment guidance with cash flow, leverage capacity and dispositions. You\u2019re off to a fast start here, it sounds like the pipeline is good. How are you thinking about expanding that guidance and using the ATM and/or equity issuance now you\u2019re once again trading above NAV? John Case : Well, Karin, the acquisitions are lumpy. So that's the word we've used to describe them. We've quarters at 700 to 800 million and quarters at 200 million to 300 million. We can't really extrapolate of one quarter and that's what we did change our guidance for acquisitions. We\u2019re still guiding to 1 billion to 1.5 billion for the year at this point. As far as capital raising, yes, we could fund our growth this year. Our estimated growth without coming to the equity markets through disposition proceeds, routine cash flow and debt, the balance sheet is in great shape right now. However, we will look at all capital opportunities, including equity and when we need to raise capital, we will use the appropriate form in the form that makes the most sense for the company. Karin Ford : My second question is going back to the M&A question earlier. Do you think that the Gramercy deal earlier this week was driven by the unique aspects of GPT\u2019s industrial real estate or do you take anything away with respect to the privatization prospects for triple net real estate generally. John Case : Well, I think industrial was the flavor of the day. We've seen a lot of competition for those types of properties. I think Gramercy did a good job, I know, Gordon, we know Gordon well, solid company. We competed frequently with them, winning our fair share and losing some on property acquisitions. They put together a nice portfolio just as we have. I think that the Blackstone transaction is driven more by the fact that Gramercy is industrial rather than you it's a net least company. I think that addresses your question. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move on to Nick Joseph with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. So just, if I think about G&A load, the last call it four years or so, you\u2019ve consistently run at this sort of 5% of revenue line in terms of G&A relative to revenues and your asset base has grown almost $5 billion over that time. How should investors think about, at what point you may or maybe you won't ever see further G&A leverage within the organization, as you continue to put out capital every year. John Case : Yeah. So, we have held at 5%, which we've been pleased with in terms of G&A as a percent of revenues. I think we'll be able to hold that level for the foreseeable future and perhaps bring it down a bit more. Paul, you want to elaborate on that? Paul Meurer : Yeah. Some of the additions of personnel over the past couple of years as we enter new property types and expanded the portfolio were necessary and we've invested in, I think, personnel and systems, which put us in good position to kind of support continued growth of the company without significant additions on the G&A side. So we're feeling kind of that curve coming, where I think a little bit more leverage will occur and we could see that number ticked down. Yes, for this year though and the near term is still around 5%. Michael Bilerman : How do you think about the right organizational structure for a net lease company? I think with Mark's announcement, have a CEO, President, and COO, CIO, a Chief Strategy Officer, I guess it\u2019s going to be a CSO, CFO, and then a number of Executive Vice Presidents that feed into that. Just from the -- I recognize you\u2019re a big company. It just seems like a lot of heads for a net lease company in their senior suite where you haven't been able to get that G&A leverage as you've grown pretty meaningfully. Paul Meurer : Well, we've got the lowest in the sector and over time, it has come down and we probably hear more comments as to why don't you continue to broaden your skill set and deepen your skillset, given the efficiency of the company. We don't have any positions right now that are not critical positions to the management of the company. So with Mark\u2019s addition, I think we'll be in a place where we've got our full complement of skillsets and it will be, I think, we'll be taking care of at the executive and any level following that. I\u2019d cite that most of our peers I think are closer to 10% in terms of G&A load as a percent of revenues. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll move on to Jason Belcher with Wells Fargo. Jason Belcher : Hi. Just wanted to ask about this headline I saw this morning about Sears partnering with Amazon to sell and install car tires, it\u2019s another retail sector that I think most people yesterday would have felt was fairly well insulated from pressures of online retail. Just wondering is this something that you've heard anything about from your auto parts and service tenants, something they\u2019ve sort of seen coming down the line or would this be more in the unexpected disruption bucket? And then if you could just remind us what your exposure is to the auto parts and service sectors please? John Case : Yeah. So to the tire services sector, 2.4% of our rental revenues are represented by tires, the tire service. And then on top of that, we have about another 4% in automotive parts and automotive service and that's an area we've been fine with. We haven't received any immediate feedback from our clients on the Sears transaction as of yet, but that's a business that we like and that certainly is benefits from the trend of automobile miles driven continuing to increase in this country. So all vehicles will need tires, regardless of whether they're gas or EDV. Sumitomo is the parent of TBC and is a very strong company with an A- rating and stands behind those leases for TBC. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : I just wanted to dig in a bit more on the new position announced in the terms of the Chief Strategy Officer. I believe this is the first time you've sort of created this role. So I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a sense of what his role would be and does this signal perhaps you looking at this sector viewer exposed to maybe in a different matter to changing the strategy say for over the next ten years, does it signal you looking at potentially bigger portfolios or maybe even strategic M&A? John Case : Well, it doesn't change our strategy. We believe that as the company has grown in size to be a $21 billion company with 5300 properties in 47 different industries, 49 states that it made sense to have a -- we've become more complex as well, but it made sense to have a executive level position dedicated to strategy. We'll continue to oversee our research and credit effort and continue to sit on the investment community and Neil\u2019s background is very well suited for this position. He'll work with the rest of the executive team, me and the board in formulating strategy going forward and I think it will be a more efficient process. So we're glad to have Neil in that role and he will do well, given the successes he had in the Chief Investment Officer role, but it does not signal any change in strategy for us. It's just a response to the growth we've had and that increasing diversification of our portfolio that we've had since 2010 when we were just a $4.5 billion company and today, we're $21 billion company. Vikram Malhotra : And just in terms of sort of the portfolio itself, you do have the concentration now in two main sectors, convenience stores and drugstores, maybe just give us some thoughts of where you'd like that to be over the next few years. John Case : Well, we're comfortable having strong sectors such as those be in that low double digit percentage of rent range. So, next quarter, we'll see C-stores, drugstores would be somewhere around 11% of rental revenues. We're comfortable with those levels. That being said, at times, we opportunistically sell some of the tenants within those categories, properties, when we have strong bids and that's a very liquid market for assets in those two industries and we often acquire a large sale leaseback transactions and did a 25 to 75 basis point cap rate, higher than what you see in the one-off market. So it's a good way for us to drive value, raise money and manage exposure, but we're comfortable with those levels, given the strength of those industries. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll move on to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. John Massocca : Given the increase in the disposition guidance and the fact that you expected to be maybe more strategic, generally speaking, what would you expect the mix on dispositions to be this year between vacant and occupied assets? Sumit Roy : In the first quarter, it was \u2013 of the 13 assets, three were occupied, 10 were vacant. I do see a shift in that in order for us to get to the 200 million as John alluded. We are having discussions on the casual dining side and a vast majority of those are going to be occupied assets. John Massocca : And then it\u2019s a little bit of a blast in the past, but can you give us a quick update on the former Gander assets, did you sell any of these properties in 1Q 18 or leasing of them? John Case : Sure. So we owned initially -- I think it was nine Ganders and they represented less than 0.5% of our revenues. So it wasn't a significant tenant for us. At this point, we resolved six of the nine, three were re-leased at recapture rates just under 90%, the expiring rent. So we were pleased with those and then we are selling, have sold and have under contract to sell three more properties and then the remaining three we're in discussions on in terms of leasing with national and regional tenants. So that's where we stand on that and we're pleased with the outcome so far. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference. I will now turn the call back over to John Case for concluding remarks. John Case : Okay. Well, thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you in a few weeks at ICSC and NAREIT. Thanks again for joining the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our conference call for today, everyone. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s second quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case. John Case : Thanks Janeen. Welcome to our call today. We're pleased with our results in the second quarter. During the quarter we invested $347 million in high quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.3%. Given the momentum we see in our business, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion from the prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We\u2019re also raising the range of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance from $3.14 to $3.20 to $3.16 to $3.21.  Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks, John. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue typically consists of easements, take in, interest income and insurance proceeds and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past.  Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with prior year G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year due to the timing of stock vesting and the cost associated with their annual meeting and proxy. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.  Funds from operation or FFO per share was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter we issued $300 million of common stock primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and only $91 million coming due in 2019, outside of our revolver. And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter.  Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6 times. In summary we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.  Now let me turn the call back over to John. John Case : Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to remain north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter we re-leased 47 properties recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent, making this our 8th consecutive quarter of positive recapture rates.  The first half of 2018 we have re-leased 102 properties recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994 we have re-leased or sold 2750 properties with leases expiring. Recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 257 commercial tenants and 48 different industries, located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenience stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high-quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade rated operators. Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists the stores with the larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales and volume, unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options. Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today\u2019s retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.8 times. Both of these store level metrics represent improvements from last quarter as our retail store level performance remains strong. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years. Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million acquisitions during the quarter at 6.5% cap rate at investment spreads consistent with our long-term average. Our investment spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased with the quality of our acquisitions. 52% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade rated tenants. Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that have the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced. Given the continued strength and visibility in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. I\u2019ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in a bit more detail. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2018, we invested $347 million in 190 properties, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years. 85% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants and convenience stores. We closed 15 discrete transactions in the second quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we\u2019ve invested $857 million in 358 properties located in 32 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% under the weighted average lease term of 13.8 years. On a revenue basis, 71% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 17 industries. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, three transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 67% were portfolios. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $17 billion in potential transaction opportunities, and of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 24% for the second quarter. Of the $347 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 25% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield, less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This bring us to 40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8%. In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target of $1.75 billion and disposition volume of approximately $200 million. With that I\u2019d like to hand it back to John? John Case : Thanks Sumit. We continue to have excellent access to the capital markets to fund our business and maintain our conservative balance sheet. We remain well-positioned upon our growth through a variety of avenues for the rest of the year. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion available on our line of credit, excluding our accordion feature. In June, we increased the dividend for the 97th time in our Company\u2019s history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the Company\u2019s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%. And we are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we\u2019re pleased with our Company\u2019s momentum across all areas of the business and remain optimistic about our prospects. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline, and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders. At this time, I like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joshua Dennerlein : Thanks for the question. Maybe you could talk about your views on Amazon\u2019s entry into the pharmacy business and how that impact [ph] CVS, Walgreens, your portfolio? John Case : Sure, Josh. I think that sort of the topic of the day is Amazon\u2019s acquisition of PillPack and what the impact it\u2019s going [technical difficulty] industry. PillPack has about five [technical difficulty] overall market share today, focus on drugs, treating long-term conditions [technical difficulty]about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs and these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So, PillPack is suitable for relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS are top two drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last five years. Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information prefer face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older -- this is the older portion of our population, the baby [technical difficulty] Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing [technical difficulty] integration alliances with PBMs. So, that\u2019s helped them capture more market share [technical difficulty] also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both, Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery [technical difficulty] and or delivery in major markets today and continue to [technical difficulty] FedEx and Walgreens have formed a venture specifically for this purpose. Another statistic that gives us comfort is since 2010, brick and mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. And again, this is due to them becoming more price competitive [technical difficulty]and out of convenience. 80% of the [technical difficulty] lives within a 5 miles of CVS or Walgreens, and the two -- the top two brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So, we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses. The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year, expected to continue to grow at a nice straight around 5%. There were [technical difficulty] not surprising to see new entrants. I\u2019d say, importantly, our pharmacies are in outstanding real estate solutions that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months, based on growth in other areas and selective asset sales, we remain really confident in the [technical difficulty] and specifically [technical difficulty]. So, we\u2019re certainly comfortable with our investments there. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Spenser Allaway : You mentioned in the opening remarks that you\u2019ve seen a good number of portfolio deals in the market. Is the increase in acquisition guidance for the year related to expectation [ph] to close some of these bigger portfolios or is this just a function of more one-off deals? John Case : It\u2019s a combination of portfolios as well as one-off transactions, Spenser. So, year-to-date, more than 80% of our acquisitions have been large -- larger negotiated [ph] sale leaseback transactions where we were the only company [ph] in negotiations with those tenants. And what we found is we\u2019re seeing a market that\u2019s really different than the broader sector. [Technical difficulty] because of our access to capital and cost of capital we\u2019re able to execute very large sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiation basis which allow us -- which enable us really to diversify. So, a lot of companies in the sector can\u2019t [technical difficulty]. So, some of the growth is coming from that activity and some of its continued one-off smaller portfolios, given a [technical difficulty] net lease acquisitions market. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : You mentioned that the cap rates on the blended basis were 6.5 for the quarter, I was wondering if you could break that down between the retail and industrial assets? John Case : The industrial asset, [technical difficulty] really one large asset, a distribution center in Northern California that [technical difficulty]development take out and on development properties we get yields that are anywhere from the 100 to 150 basis points higher than where we get them on a stabilized basis. So, this particular -- on the industrial side our cap rates because it was the development property were actually higher than 6.5%. And then on the retail side, they were just slightly under that, Nick. Nick Joseph : And you mentioned the watch list but [technical difficulty] meaningful changes to rent coverage ratio for any of your larger [technical difficulty]? John Case : The information that\u2019s been coming in, sales from our tenants that report are continuing to improve. And that\u2019s why you saw our coverage levels pick up a little bit from where they were in the previous quarter. So, the news on a tenant level is positive and we feel very good about [technical difficulty] really minimal percentage is outstanding on the watch list. Operator : Our next question will come from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford : With over $500 million out on the line and in active pipeline, should we expect bond issuance in the second half of the year? And then if you over [technical difficulty] the second quarter acquisitions, just if you could give us your current thoughts on leverage in the current environment. John Case : We\u2019re pleased with the strength of the balance sheet today, debt to EBITDA at 5.5x. When we look forward, including the accordion, we have about $2 billion of capacity on the revolver. Our overall floating rate debt exposure [technical difficulty] right now. We also have [technical difficulty] we\u2019re anticipating about $150 million in proceeds, asset sales, and we\u2019re also anticipating probably about $75 million retained equity from our business in our operations to help fund our growth. Both, the bond -- really all the long-term capital markets are open to us right now, 10-year bond [technical difficulty] and right around four, three or so. So, that\u2019s attractive. And as the appropriate [technical difficulty] all of our alternatives Karin with regard to financing the acquisitions. Karin Ford : And my second question is, what are the trends you are seeing on investments [technical difficulty] quarter, so, so far in the third quarter. [technical difficulty] able to maintain them at above average levels for the rest [technical difficulty]? John Case : Well, right now they are coming at attractive levels. So, I think the second quarter levels are pretty indicative of where [technical difficulty] this quarter, and we\u2019re optimistic that spreads will continue to widen out a bit, so our margins will improve. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brian Hawthorne : Hi. On your industrial portfolio, are there any markets that you\u2019re kind of starting to look at or get less interested in? John Case : Well, we\u2019ve on the industrial side had a strategy of being in significant markets where there\u2019s good re-leasing opportunities if needed or in mission-critical locations. The markets that [technical difficulty] in right now, that\u2019s a very attractive sector right now. And the valuations are quite attractive. But, we\u2019re not seeing any huge speculative supply issues in any of those markets. So, what is being built by the developers out there is being leased typically, if it\u2019s not already pre-leased, leased during the construction phase. And by the time it\u2019s completed, it\u2019s leased. So, you we\u2019re not looking to exit any specific markets on the industrial side, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Spenser Allaway : Thanks. Sorry, guys. Just a quick follow-up as it relates to development. [Technical difficulty] development represents a small portion of portfolio and it does look like the pipeline has been winding down. Curious how you view development in the current environment specifically with construction cost summarized? John Case : So, on the development side, it\u2019s always been an attractive way for us to grow. So, we have $25 million under development today. As I said, the yields are more attractive on development than they are on acquisitions. So, we remain bullish on -- we\u2019d like to have more underdevelopment, decent amount of development spend second quarter, but we\u2019re looking to put more development on the books forward. Now to remind everyone, all the development is preleased. We don\u2019t do speculative development and [technical difficulty] existing clients. So, certainly a low-risk form of development. Operator : Our next question will come from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. John Massocca : Quick modeling detail question. What specifically this quarter drove the sizable other income number? I know it\u2019s variable quarter to quarter but I think Q2 2018 was higher than you guys do in most years. John Case : [Technical difficulty] so that $2.6 million payment in insurance proceeds on one asset, an asset that was destroyed by a tornado and that showed up in our other income area. John Massocca : Okay. That makes sense. And then kind of philosophically, I know with [technical difficulty] valuation [technical difficulty] is probably not something that\u2019s top of mind. But how do you look at your industrial assets potentially as a sort of [technical difficulty] if you were to see equity market volatility, given how kind of robust that market has been even at the beginning of this year? John Massocca : We always [technical difficulty] asset sales, irrespective of [technical difficulty] as opportunities for us to [technical difficulty] capital and drive growth. And those asset sales are done on strategic bases, sometimes involving credits we want to limit our exposure to or markets we want to limit our exposure to or just decrease industry exposure. And sometimes those are -- those sales are driven opportunistically because we get really attractive pricing and a pricing which makes us [technical difficulty] conclude that it makes us more valuable company [technical difficulty] shareholders to sell the property and recycle the proceeds than to hold onto those assets. So, that\u2019s how we look at our entire portfolio and there\u2019s no doubt that currently industrial pricing is attractive but a number of our areas have attractive cap rates currently. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this question-and-answer session portion of Realty Income conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. End of Q&A: John Case : All right. Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing you this fall in conferences and marketing meetings. So, I hope everybody has a good summer and thanks again for joining us. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Collin Mings - Raymond James John Massocca - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2018 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead. Janeen Bedard : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Janeen. Welcome to our call today. I am honored to have taken on the role as CEO and I am excited about the future of Realty Income given the strength of our diversified high quality portfolio, strong investment opportunities, and most importantly our talented team. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Board and the team to evolve and execute on our strategic priorities, and I am confident Realty Income can continue to capture opportunities to build and enhance our portfolio and drive value for our stakeholders. I would also like to thank our former CEO, John Case, for his service and guidance over the years. John has played a pivotal role in building the Company into what it is today and we wish him the very best. In my seven years with the Company, I've had the opportunity to meet many of our investors and analysts and I look forward to enhancing this engagement in the future. With that, let\u2019s turn to the business. We continue to see strength in the current market environment as well as our investment pipeline. During the third quarter, we invested $609 million in high quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.2%. S&P raised our credit rating to A- during the quarter, which was largely driven by our consistent track record of performance and the stability of our portfolio. Given the current strength in our business, we are increasing the low-end of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance by $0.02, from $3.16 to $3.21, to a range of $3.18 to $3.21. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 260 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties just over 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.4% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with the service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with ecommerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate with the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.7x. Our watch list at 1.4% of rent remains consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.8%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to remain in the mid-98% for 2018. During the quarter, we released 64 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date, we have released 166 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 2,800 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 87% of the releases have contractual rent increases. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul Meurer : Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, excluding the recent CEO severance payment. We continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in 2018. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. This compares favorably to our 2017 run rate due to lower bad debt expense and the timing of certain expenses. We continue to expect non-reimbursable property expenses to generally be in the 1.5% to 2% range. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.81 for the quarter. As a reminder, a reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.81 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.2% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, which we believe contributed to the SMP upgrade to A- that Sumit mentioned earlier. Combined with our upgrade to A3 by Moody's a year-ago, we are now one of only a few REITs with at least AA ratings. During the third quarter, we issued $293 million of common stock primarily through our ATM program. Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains 5.5 times, and our fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.6 times. The weighted-average maturity of our bonds is approximately nine years, which is over a year longer than it was a year-ago. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $7.3 billion of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $91 million coming into next year and our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity. Last week, we were very pleased to announce the expansion of our $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility. The new facility increases the capacity of our revolver from $2 billion to $3 billion, plus a $1 billion accordion expansion feature. The initial maturity date is March 2023 plus 2 6-month extension options, thereafter. The increased line capacity enhances our liquidity and provide ready access to capital for our property acquisition efforts. Our borrowing spread decreased to 77.5 basis points over LIBOR, which matches the tightest pricing grid in the REIT industry. As part of the recast, we also issued a new $250 million term loan with a tenor of just under 5.5 years. Concurrently, we executed a floating to fixed interest rate swap, which effectively fixed the interest rate on the term loan at 3.89%. 23 lenders participated in the new credit facility, many of whom we have done business with for several years. We very much appreciate the long-term support of our banking partners as we've grown over the years and we welcomed the lenders who are new to the relationship with Realty Income. Now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thanks Paul. I\u2019ll now move to our investment activity. During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with a weighted-average lease term of 15.3 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 62% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 99.4% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 19 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, restaurants, and dollar stores. We closed 14 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $1.465 billion in 591 properties located in 37 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.32%, and with a weighted-average lease term of 14.4 years. On a revenue basis, 67% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 37 different tenants in 20 industries. Of the 39 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 5 transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. During the third quarter, we sourced more than $8.4 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $3.6 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $26 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 39% of the volume sourced for the third quarter. Of the $609 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 7% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the third quarter. Investment-grade properties continue to trade around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trade from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted-average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 154 basis points in the third quarter, which was slightly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted-average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remained one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that has the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Year-to-date, 81% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. We remain confident in achieving our 2018 acquisition guidance of approximately $1.75 billion. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 20 properties for net proceeds of $35.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.8%. This brings us to 60 properties sold year-to-date for $83 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%. Largely due to the timing of dispositions, we are decreasing our disposition guidance for 2018 from approximately $200 million to approximately $150 million. In September, we increased the dividend for the 98 time in our Company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividends every year since the companies listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we are pleased with the current state of the company and remain excited about our prospects moving forward. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Christy McElroy with Citi. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Christy. Wondering if you could provide some color on any additional acquisitions and process that are on contract currently, just to get a better sense for timing at the end of the year. And based on opportunities you're seeing in the market today, would you expect a similar pace of acquisitions in 2019? Sumit Roy : So as we've always indicated acquisitions are very, very difficult to forecast year out. What I can share with you, that in the fourth quarter we have a very healthy pipeline. We feel very confident about meeting our $1.75 billion guidance. We will probably exceed it by a bit. But at this point to talk about what we are planning on doing in 2019 will be premature. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then just one quick follow-up on the dispositions during the quarter. Was there anything in particular that drove the cap rate a bit higher this quarter and what should we expect as far as pricing for remaining asset sales in the balance of the year? Sumit Roy : The cap rates are largely driven by the types of assets that are being sold. We did reduce our guidance from $200 billion to $150 billion and that was largely being driven by timing and some opportunistic sales that we pulled from the market. So we feel like, our IRR should be right around 8%, which we have historically achieved and should be able to get to $150 million in sales by the end of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Hi, good morning out there. Sumit, congratulations on the new role. The Company's last two press releases both mentioned that you'd be working with the Board to evolve the company strategy. Can you elaborate what that evolution might entail? And could we see \u2013 be seeing investments in new asset classes or a change in the way management looks to create value for shareholders? Sumit Roy : Thank you for your question, Karin. What I would want to emphasize is that we will continue to execute on our current strategy as we believe the market remains very strong for the product that we are pursuing. And that was quite evident in the results that we achieved year-to-date as well as in the third quarter. The team that we have in place here has largely been together for the last five years and was the architect and devised the current strategy that we have in place that we've been executing quite successfully. Having said that, we are always looking for new avenues to grow. Four or five years ago, six years ago, we entered into the industrial market. Right along then, we also explored agriculture and ended up making an investment in Napa Valley. So to look at new avenues of growth is something that we are constantly doing and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But having said that, we believe there's enough runway in our current strategy and we feel very confident of meeting growth rates on a risk adjusted basis that will be viewed as appropriate for this company. Karin Ford : Thanks for that. My second question is regarding investments. You've had a lot of successes here with corporate sale leasebacks. Do you think that could continue into next year or do you expect the changing lease accounting rules might reduce demand for those deals? Sumit Roy : The changes in the lease rules have not impacted our discussions with our relationship tenants. In fact, if anything and we've spoken about this in the past, the viable market for sale leaseback continues to grow and continues to grow with tenants that traditionally wouldn't engage in those conversations. So our take on our pipeline for 2019, the current discussions that we're having with our existing relationships and some new relationships lead us to believe that the lease changes will have a very \u2013 will have no impact and the market, the viable market for sale leaseback will continue to grow. Operator : And our next question will come from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Sumit, the last time you had a very attractive cost of capital? Maybe 2 years ago, you chose to buy higher quality to a lot of drug stores, that exposure in certain areas. Just wondering now you\u2019re sitting here relative, you have a very good cost of capital to maybe other REIT asset classes. What do you plan to do with it maybe similar and maybe different? Sumit Roy : Well, what we hope to believe is that the higher cost \u2013 the lower cost of capital that was afforded to us was a function of the strategy that we had implemented and what we had highlighted to the market as the types of retail products and the industrial products that we were most interested in. And the fact that we've continued to be quite successful and once again find ourselves with a very low cost of capital. On a relative basis, we've always had a low cost of capital and if you look at what's happened over the last three to four years, the cost of equity for us has been on a relative basis amongst the lowest. Now with these two upgrades, the cost of debt has become even lower than most of our peers. So on a blended basis, we've always had the advantage of having a very low cost of capital. I don't think that that necessarily comes into the calculus in terms of defining what a strategy needs to be. We want to be very true to anything. We believe we have a strategy in place that allows us to create a balance sheet and a portfolio that can do very well regardless of what the economic conditions are. And we are going to continue to do that. And the fact that we have a very low cost of capital today, I don't think necessarily is going to change the strategy that we have in place and some of the other avenues that we are continuing to explore, given what we find in the cost of capital. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just \u2013 second question I know we've talked over the last couple of weeks on this and I think everyone's just trying to get a better sense of how this change occurred? How it was taught about it seemed a bit sudden in terms of John's departure. So I'm just wondering if you can give us some sense of how this was being contemplated anymore \u2013 more thoughts on just the discussions and maybe just to build off of one of the earlier questions on. I know you'd said nothing too different, but maybe what would you be doing incremental from here? Sumit Roy : So to answer the question around the suddenness, I mean this was a decision that the Board and John mutually agreed upon. These are discussions that oftentimes happens. When you think about is there a good time for a change and see that never it really is. And \u2013 but the Board and John mutually agreed to part ways, the Board believe that making the transition now is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders and given the depth and strength of our management team and it was believe that doing it now versus down the road was the right decision. The speed question that you raised Vikram, I've said there are two schools of thought on that one, which is the more traditional route where you typically have a three to six month transition period. And that works in a situation where the incoming CEO may not be immediately ready to take on the reins. But in this case, both the Board and John concurred that I was ready to take on the reins and incorporating a transition period would have just delayed the inevitable. So from what's transpired, I think that should pretty much address how things have come about. In terms of what I'm going to do differently, the advantage that I've had is, I've worked with this team and have been part of this team for the last seven years and this team by and large has been intact for all of that time. I've been along with the team very much part and parcel of defining the strategy and then executing on the strategy. So there's a sense of continuity that we continue to have and that is going to bode well. So if you're looking to see for any dramatic changes in terms of how we\u2019re going to conduct business, et cetera. I don't believe, you're going to see that. So its business as usual and what I might do slightly differently is be on the road a little bit more, be a bit more visible in terms of meeting shareholders, et cetera. And in terms of internally, and I think I've mentioned this in some individual conversations is have a flatter organizational structure where my connectivity with my direct reports i.e., all of the EPVs in the company, is going to be, just have one degree of separation. So those are very minor changes. But that's more in line with how I would like to run the Company, but in terms of strategy, et cetera. It's business as usual. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi Sumit, congratulations on the promotion. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Todd. Todd Stender : When you look at the 7-Eleven acquired in the quarter were these sale leasebacks and can you describe the lease terms, these are rent escalator, rent coverage, just some of the specifics? Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Yes. These are all sale leasebacks. I sort of alluded to the fact that we get very good pricing. I would go so far as to say that the pricing that we get on sale leasebacks that we are doing directly with 7-Eleven is in the tune of around 75 to 50 basis points higher than what you would get in the one-off market. They are 16-year average lease terms and they have a 7.5% growth every five. Todd Stender : Okay. Thank you. And then Paul just looking at the balance sheet, your line balance was getting up close to $800 million just at the end of Q2, but that was on the $2 billion line and that used to be a big number, but relative to the size of the company, maybe not so. But on a $3 billion line, could we see that balance grow even higher? It may look on an absolute basis large, but maybe on a comparable basis, not so much. But how big that the line balance for you guys get? Paul Meurer : So I think that's fair to consider from an overall risk management standpoint and variable rate debt exposure. These are relative to our peers and/or how we view the balance sheet. Keep in mind that the larger line was more a function of giving us the liquidity and flexibility on the acquisition front that we thought was appropriate as opposed to trying to foreshadow any change in balance sheet philosophy. Relative to the current balance on the line, I'll remind everyone that we closed on a $250 million term loan just a week or week or so ago, which then immediately was applied to that line. That was a funded term loan. And in addition, we have some property sales activity in the fourth quarter. So from a funding standpoint, the line balance will not be a very large. It's currently, as of a week ago was under $600 million after that term loan repayment. And we're not in a position where we need to access capital for any particular reason because our leverage metrics are very good as well. But all forms of it are available to us and we'll be taking a look at all forms of it on a go forward basis, but we're not in a position right now where we have any immediate funding needs. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James. Collin Mings : Thanks and congratulations Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thanks Collin. Collin Mings : Just first question for me, just going back to Karin's question actually. As your platform continues to grow, just maybe how are you currently thinking about international opportunities specifically? Sumit Roy : We don't have immediate plans to go international. But like I've said, all avenues are on the table and we continued to look at avenues of growth of which to ignore international would be, wouldn't be correct. But we don't have any immediate plans to go international. And like I've said, Collin, we believe we have enough runway in executing our current strategy that gives us comfort that any one of these new avenues that we come up with, we will have time to test it, make sure that this is something that fits our overall strategy of conservatism and risk adjusted growth rates, and at the appropriate time we'll be ready to speak with the market about it, but no immediate plans. Collin Mings : Okay. And then on \u2013 as far as the 7-Eleven, you touched on the cap rate differential between what you think the pricing would be on the one-off market versus, again being a portfolio. Like you suggested, maybe 75, 50 basis points. Just maybe making a little bit broader picture here, how are you thinking about the portfolio premium or discount in the marketplace right now and at maybe what threshold of \u2013 in terms of deal size do you start to see that really take effect? Paul Meurer : Look over 80% of what we did was sale leasebacks this particular quarter. And what we're finding is with these large institutional tenants that we have very deep relationships with. They are very open to having discussions around adjusting cap rates to accommodate the changing cap rate environment and that accrues to our favor. The fact that we've been able to do north of $1 billion of 7-Eleven in the last two years and get cap rates that are off of the one-off market to the tune of 75 basis points speaks to that point. So we feel like that there are discounts that we get by entering into these portfolio transactions, especially with sophisticated institutional tenants. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. John Massocca : Good afternoon. And first off, congratulation Sumit on the new role. Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. John Massocca : So were there any other tenant industries that particularly dominated this quarter's acquisition activity? I know with the 7-Eleven, obviously, C-stores would be one of them, but anything outside of that? Sumit Roy : There were C-stores and restaurants. Those were the two dominant areas of industries. John Massocca : And my second question here, were those casual dining or QSR? Sumit Roy : Casual dining. John Massocca : Okay. And then does the current strategy leave open the potential for M&A activity, especially given the strong cost of capital? Or are you really still primarily focused on what you've done in the last couple of quarters in terms of larger sale leaseback transactions and given how strong that market has been for you guys? Sumit Roy : Yes. Look we control the discussion around the sale leaseback market. These are organic acquisitions that have served us very well over the last few years. M&A is something that we don't count on and that's not to say that we are averse of doing M&A transactions. This Company has had a history of having done some of those, but that is not something that we control and we don't count on that. We are very happy with the runway that we have executing our current strategy and the numbers speak for themselves. So John, if you're asking this is something that we are aggressively going to start pursuing, then the answer is no, but we're not averse to M&A either. John Massocca : Color is very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : And next we'll go to Christy McElroy with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy. So the question is just regarding the CEO transition. So did john get a bonus for 2018 or an accrued bonus relative to his comp level? Sumit Roy : The severance was largely negotiated Michael and it was in line with his \u2013 the agreements that were in place as well as his employment agreement. So the 28 \u2013 approximately $28 million that we have listed was pretty much in line with his employment agreement and the agreement around his stock awards. Michael Bilerman : I mean, if you read the proxy, it was generally in line with that, but we're sitting here in November effectively not \u2013 from a timing perspective, why would he agree to forego $10 million of a bonus if he worked basically until January 1 of next year. And I don't know many people that would give up $10 million, whether he could have rolled into next year and then decided to do it? Sumit Roy : No, the fact that we \u2013 I think we\u2019ve also just highlighted the fact that $9 million of it had already been accrued. So you can pretty much assume that what had been accrued for this year was part of the $28 million that was paid out. So I don't believe it's accurate for you to assume that his pro rata share, he had to forego that. End of Q& A Operator : And this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Caroline, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you all at NAREIT conference next week. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's conference. Thank you, everyone. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the VEREIT Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Bonni Rosen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Bonni Rosen : Thank you, Andrew. Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2018 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 11 :30 a.m. Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529 with the confirmation code of 10127690.  Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT's actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the annual report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law.  Let me quickly review the format of today's call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly and year-end financial results. Glenn will then discuss 2019 guidance, and we will conclude today's call by opening the line for questions. Glenn, let me turn the call over to you. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, Bonni, and thank you all for joining our call today. We are pleased with the results for the year as we met or exceeded the core components of our business plan and guidance. AFFO per diluted share was $0.72. We had another very active year of capital allocation with over $4.6 billion transacted. Acquisitions totaled $500 million, and we repurchased $50 million of stock at an average price of $6.94. Dispositions totaled $567 million. We entered into a new credit facility with a $2 billion revolver and $900 million 5-year loan at more favorable terms than our previous one and refinanced $598 million convertible debt with a $550 million 7-year unsecured bond issuance. Net debt to normalized EBITDA ended the year at 5.9x, which includes the effect of $217.5 million in settlement payments. We remain very liquid and have no unsecured maturities until December 2020. We also had a very active year of leasing with 6.6 million square feet of activity and occupancy ending at a healthy 98.8%. Same-store rent was up 1% for the quarter and 0.5% for the year. Excluding the effect of an early lease renewal, same-store rents would have been 1.3% for the quarter and 1% for the year. We had approximately 2 million square feet expiring in 2018. However, as I just mentioned, we leased 6.6 million square feet, of which 4.6 million square feet were early renewals. This year's leasing performance is a good illustration of our leasing team's focus on our forward expiration schedule. For example, over the last 2 years, we have reduced this year, 2019, expirations by 1.6% from 4.7% to 3.1%.  Notable renewal transactions included 3.8 million square feet of industrial, 1.3 million square feet of retail, 628,000 square feet of office and 381,000 square feet of restaurants. For new leases, we recaptured 104% of prior rents, renewals 95% and early renewals 98%. We continue to see a robust commercial real estate market with $562 billion transacted during 2018, an increase of roughly 15% from last year. Liquid debt market supported real estate activity. We participated in this activity with $22 billion of single-tenant properties offered to us and were able to spread invest with acquisition cap rates of 7.1 and disposition cap rates of 6.9. With that as a backdrop, fourth quarter acquisitions totaled $221 million, bringing 2018 acquisitions to $500 million. Dispositions in the fourth quarter totaled $184 million with $567 million for the year. Acquisitions have been targeted to discount retail, and functional well-located industrial properties. 68% of our acquisitions were retail properties and are preferred merchandise categories, such as home furnishings, hobby, discount, fitness and convenience, with 32% industrial, primarily in distribution facilities. Sourcing of this product resulted in 42% sale leasebacks and 22% built-to-suit properties. Our acquisitions benefit portfolio health and allow us to remain within our disciplined guidelines. Along with acquisitions, dispositions continue to be directed towards improving the portfolio. Our strategy has focused on reducing restaurants, office, flat leases, JVs and noncore.  From the start of our business plan, we've improved portfolio metrics. Our top 10 tenants represented 27.2%, down from 33.3% in 2015. Red Lobster is now 5.5%, down from 11.8%. Office is 19.3%, down from 22%. Flat leases are now under 20%. Investment grade tenants remain healthy at 42%. As important, we're focused on our debt balances. We've reduced net debt to normalized EBITDA from 7.5 to 5.9. We also took a very important step in simplifying our business model with the sale of Cole Capital completed in February of last year. As part of that sale, our transition services agreement will end in March. Mike will cover this as part of his G&A discussion. Before Mike reviews our financial results, let me provide a brief update on litigation. During 2018, all fact depositions were completed, and we settled claims brought by opt out shareholders representing 31% of VEREIT's outstanding shares of common stock for a total of $217.5 million. Subsequent to the year, we settled with additional shareholders for approximately $15.7 million, which brings the total to $233.2 million representing 33.5%. The judge has set a trial date for September 9 of this year and the next status conference with the court is scheduled for April 17. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-K filed today. Let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael Bartolotta : Thanks, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. We finished the year on plan achieving AFFO per share of $0.72. As usual, we will focus on earnings from continuing operations for this call. In the fourth quarter, rental revenue was flat compared to last quarter. In our 10-K, you will note that the operating expense reimbursement line has been combined in rental revenue for all periods presented in order to streamline our statement of operations. However, this detail can still be found in the definition section of the supplement. Net income increased $101.8 million to $27.9 million from a net loss of $73.9 million, primarily due to lower net litigation and settlement costs of $115.1 million, along with higher other income of $8.1 million from the gain on the sale of certain mortgage-related securities and an unexpected receipt from a fully reserved receivable, partially offset by a lower gain on the disposition of real estate of $19.4 million. FFO per diluted share increased $0.12 from $0.04 to $0.16, mostly due to lower net litigation and settlement costs to $115.1 million, along with higher other income of $8.1 million, partially offset by higher G&A of $2 million and interest expense of $2 million in the fourth quarter.  AFFO per share decreased approximately $0.005 to $0.17 per share, mostly due to higher G&A and interest expense. The G&A increase was primarily due to normal Q4 year-end compensation and other accrual adjustments. Full year G&A was $63.9 million, slightly under our guidance range of $65 million to $68 million. As part of the Cole Capital transition services ending, we indicated there would be an increase in G&A. There has been a lag in the recognition of that increase into this year, and our guidance for 2019 is a similar range of $66 million to $69 million. Our guidance for 2019 G&A assumes that we will take a restructuring charge in 2019 of approximately $11 million to rightsize our operations once the Cole transition agreement ends on March 31, 2019. This charge will include the onetime cost of reducing space in our Phoenix and New York offices, which represents about 80% of the estimated restructuring costs. CapEx for the year was $22.2 million, and over the last three years, we have averaged just over $20 million. For 2019, we expect CapEx cost will be closer to $30 million.  During the quarter, there were $7.8 million of litigation expenses. We previously indicated that we expected to be at the higher end of our guidance range of $55 million to $65 million, and we ended with a net amount of $59.8 million. However, included in this amount is a fourth quarter reduction of $10.9 million, due to a direct reimbursement from our insurer to a third party. Expenses would have been $70.7 million for the year had this not been the case. Also, as part of the insurance litigation settlement, the company received $48 million in insurance proceeds in the first quarter of 2019. We expect gross litigation expenses in 2019 will not be less than 2018.  As Glenn discussed, subsequent to year-end, we settled with additional shareholders for approximately $15.7 million, which was accrued in the fourth quarter litigation-related expenses, bringing this item in the financial to $23.5 million in Q4. Turning to our fourth quarter real estate activity. The company purchased 10 properties for $221 million at a weighted average cash cap rate of 7.1%. Acquisitions totaled $500 million for the year at an average cash cap rate of 7.1%. Subsequent to the quarter, the company purchased 3 properties for $37 million.  During the quarter, we disposed of 37 properties for $148 million. Of this amount, $141 million was used in the total weighted average cash cap rate calculation of 7.1%, including $49 million in net sales of Red Lobster. The gain on the fourth quarter sales was approximately $26 million. In addition, the company sold certain legacy mortgage-related investments during the quarter for an aggregate sales price of $36 million.  Dispositions for 2018 totaled $521 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.9% and a capital gain of $97 million. In addition, the company sold certain legacy mortgage-related investments in 2018 totaling $46 million. Subsequent to the quarter, the company disposed of 8 properties for an aggregate sales price of $9 million and $8 million of certain legacy mortgage-related investments as well. In 2018, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and remain very liquid. In May, we entered into a new $2.9 billion credit facility replacing our $2.3 billion facility. The new facility was comprised of a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit and a $900 million related to our unsecured term loan. In August, the company repaid $598 million of principal outstanding related to the 2018 convertible notes. In October, we completed a 4.625% $550 million bond issuance. This 7-year bonds fit nicely into our maturity schedule as we had no debt coming due in 2025.  As of year-end, we had drawn $253 million on our revolving line of credit and $150 million on our term loan. Subsequent to year-end, we utilized the remainder of the delayed-draw term loan to pay the $750 million bond, which just matured in the beginning of February. We now have no unsecured maturities until the end of 2020. Additionally, we reduced our secured debt by $12.5 million in the fourth quarter and a total of $154 million for the year. We will continue to have any secured debt that is maturing be termed out as unsecured debt. Our net debt to normalized EBITDA ended at 5.9x. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio remained healthy at 2.9x, and our net debt to gross real estate investments ratio was 40%. Our unencumbered asset ratio was 75%. The weighted average duration of our debt was 4.2 years and is 92% fixed. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into a interest rate swap, fixing the interest on the $900 million term loan, which will bring our floating rate debt to approximately 4.4% and locks in an effective rate of 3.84%. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Glenn. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, Mike. I'll now turn to guidance for 2019. AFFO per share between $0.68 and $0.70. Normalized debt -- net debt to normalized EBITDA of approximately 6x. Real estate operations with average occupancy above 98% and same-store rental growth ranging from 0.3% to 1%. Dispositions totaling $350 million to $500 million at an average cap rate of 6.5% to 7.5%, targeting our continued diversification categories, restaurants, office, flat lease and noncore. Acquisition guidance of $250 million to $500 million at an average cap rate of 6.5% to 7.5%, primarily in discount retail and industrial distribution. Acquisitions and dispositions have been generally matched as we remain conscious of our debt levels. Our guidance does not assume resolution of any pending litigation. We are very pleased with capital market funding. Since we've initiated our business plan back in 2015, we've had a total capital activity of $11 billion; $1.4 billion in acquisitions, $3.7 billion in dispositions and $5.8 billion of debt and equity. This has allowed us to strengthen and diversify our portfolio, reduce debt and obtain investment-grade ratings, better allowed our maturity schedule and provided ample liquidity in the form of unencumbered assets and availability on our line of credit. We have navigated in an evolving market with our experienced management team and are well positioned for 2019. Looking beyond 2019, we will have a healthy portfolio, well-organized operating platform and a solid balance sheet. I'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Glenn, your same-store rents were up 1%, much better than historical. Can you give us a little bit more detail what was driving that outperformance in the quarter? Glenn Rufrano : Sure, Sheila. As we've discussed in the past, our leasing teams have been working on early renewals, and you can see this year, we had actually 2 million square feet that came due but we leased 6.6 million. That's really good in terms of our expirations and increasing NAV, but on a short-term basis, it has depressed some of our same store. What we found in the fourth quarter, some of that depression giving people some early rents when we have lower same-store came back to us. So we recognized some increases in that temporary amount of same store due to early renewals. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And then can you help us understand how many more opt-out opportunities there might be for VEREIT to settle prior to the September trial? And also if you could give us any insights if these settlements have prompted any additional discussions with the class ahead of the September trial? Glenn Rufrano : Well, let me go back and go through some of the history, Sheila. I understand your question, and let's see if I can straighten some of that out, some concepts of opt out versus the last settlement that we just announced for $15.7 million. If we go back to last year, we had 14 opt outs and opt out, I'll define here, is a shareholder, who filed a lawsuit separate from the class. So we had 14 filed separately. We settled with 13 of those 14 last year and that total number was $217.5 million for 31%. That leaves 1 opt out left. Substantially, the rest of the litigation is the class, including that opt out. So that sets the stage for what an opt out is and the definition. We announced this year that we had a settlement with a group of shareholders, who decided not to participate as class members, they're in the class, they decided not to participate as class members. That group had their own outside counsel representing those shareholders, and they approached the company. We did have a settlement with them, they represented approximately 2.5% for $15.7 million. That's the total of $233.2 million for the 33.5%. Those are the facts of what have occurred. So there is 1 opt out left as defined as a shareholder, who filed a suit, the rest of the shareholders are in the class. Sheila McGrath : So there is no reason to believe that anybody else would leave the class to settle early, is that accurate? Glenn Rufrano : I think the best way I can answer to that is that a group of shareholders in the class decided to bring outside counsel into the situation, representing them and approached us. That's the best way I can answer that. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And one last question. Can you explain in a little bit more detail that $48.4 million insurance settlement, what that was related to? And if you will be able to collect on any additional legal expenses from the insurance? Michael Bartolotta : This is Mike, Sheila. That primarily were bills in the past that we had paid and had made claims for and it was simply in the process of being worked through and then with the settlement of the insurance litigation at the end of the year, that's when those amounts were eventually able to be paid in the first quarter. And that represents -- those payments that we talked about, the $10.9 million that went to the third party and the $48 million that went to us, that represents substantially all of the coverage. Glenn Rufrano : And just, Sheila, to go back, we had received $20 million before that. So if you add all that up, it's about $80 million. And the reason, the last pieces were stuck, is that there was litigation with the insurer, which we settled up, and we're able to free up the remaining funds. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : I'll start with the litigation since we're on that. One is, when would you start any process to go after proceeds from codefendants on stuff that's been settled already? Glenn Rufrano : There is no decision made on that, Anthony, at this time. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then, if we get through 2019 and suppose that the class and/or opt outs get settled along the same lines that what's been settled thus far, has been done at, how would you change the way you're running the business or what you're doing, if at all, at this point? Glenn Rufrano : The first thing I\u2019d say is that in terms of your question, I just want to make clear that we have no accrual in our balance sheet for any remaining pending litigation and Mike, why don't you explain why? Michael Bartolotta : And we don't believe that any accrual at this point can be made under GAAP, because we don't believe it could be reasonably estimated. Glenn Rufrano : I just want to make that clear. Then to answer the heart of your question, Tony, what do we look like when we grow up? We have worked really hard in the last 3.5 years to make sure that this company has the best portfolio, the best management team and a best and liquid balance sheet. As I said on -- in my statement, we look forward to beyond 2019 with those 3 elements, and with those 3 elements, we can compete with anybody in the business. We have to prove ourselves, we have to grow AFFO, but we have the tools to do it, and we'll continue to have the tools to do it, so that we can compete with and what we think is a very good business, a business that provides equity to corporate America, in return getting back their housing long-term and providing a long and stable balance sheet with the ability to grow it with accretive acquisitions. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then, if I look at the portfolio today, I think the weighted average remaining lease term is 8.9 years. And if we look at your 2019 guidance, not a huge amount of net activity. So you kind of move along another year, if you will. How do you think about that number over time? And any concern over it getting shorter in terms of the remaining duration before you can kind of return to growth and kind of add longer-duration assets to it? Like, how do you think about that? Glenn Rufrano : Well, we were at 9.5 years about three years ago. And we're now at 8.9. That's pretty good for a company that has been mainly selling and not buying. We've been able to maintain that differential in three ways. We have been selling some shorter-term assets, and if we think it's right and then primarily noncore, we'll sell them, which could help that. What we have bought has generally been well over 15 years. And the third element I point to is what I talked about early on. Our leasing team is doing an awful lot of early renewals. And as we're doing early renewals, we're extending leases. So the combination of portfolio management in those three areas, acquisition, disposition and expansions, has allowed us to minimize the dilution involved over the last three years. We will continue to do that. We're conscious of it, we like to keep it as high as -- as reasonably high as possible and maintain a quality portfolio. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just last question. I think, Mike, you mentioned $11 million of restructuring charges. Is that in the AFFO number? Or is that an add back? Michael Bartolotta : No, it's not included in AFFO. The restructuring is outside of it. Glenn Rufrano : And Tony, as we mentioned, a large part of that is on space in Phoenix and here. Just to be clear, Phoenix is our headquarters, and it will remain our headquarters, but we're going to be reducing space as Cole moves out, and we'll stay in that same building, but we'll be going from basically 4 floors to 1.5. And in New York, we're actually going to move out of the building we're sitting in right now and reduce our space in half and move a couple of blocks away. Operator : The next question comes from Spenser Allaway of Green Street Advisors. Spenser Allaway : Looking at your external growth guidance for '19, how much of the $375 million in acquisitions do you expect to come from deals with existing tenants versus those that would be new to your portfolio? Glenn Rufrano : Well, it's -- the way I think about that, Spenser, is where on the transaction it's coming from. As you noticed, we have 42% of our transactions in sale leasebacks this year and about 20% in build to suits. Many of those are clients of ours coming back to us. Sometimes they will come through a broker, but they're primarily people we've done business with in sale leasebacks and build to suits. If we can maintain that form of ratio, I would hope that -- I expect at least 50% of what we do will come through brokers. And maybe we can do another 50% direct, if we can maintain those relationships. Spenser Allaway : Okay. And then on the disposition front, you guys noted you're going to continue to reduce your exposure to restaurants, noncore, et cetera. But could you maybe comment on your exposure to double-net leases. I believe it's about 35% of your annualized rental income. Is there any intention to reduce this exposure? Glenn Rufrano : We have no direct relationship between sales and double net. We feel fully qualified to manage these properties. We have a full team that does that. And if there is a little more risk there, we have the infrastructure to take that risk. So there is no -- any reason at all for us to discount or sell because they're double net or triple net. We look at them, price the risk and feel very comfortable with it. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks, everybody, for joining us. We feel very good about our year and very good about what's to come. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2019 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Crum, Senior Associate, Realty Income. Please go ahead sir. Andrew Crum : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Andrew. Welcome to our call today. We are pleased to begin 2019 with another successful quarter. During the quarter we invested approximately $520 million in high-quality real estate and investment spread, well above our historical average and we continue to see ample transaction flow that meets our investment parameters. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced our international expansion through a GBP429 million sale leaseback transaction in the UK with Sainsbury's under long-term triple-net leases. This represents a natural evolution of our Company's strategy and we will continue to grow our international platform as we are well-positioned to capitalize on a significant addressable market in the UK and mainland Europe. From a strategic standpoint, we believe there is a dearth of large institutional buyers pursuing the quality of single tenant net leased assets in Europe that we intend to invest in. Given our portable size, scale and cost of capital advantages, we believe we have a unique ability to execute sizable portfolio transactions with best-in-class operators. This transaction was relationship-driven and was completed on an off-market negotiated basis. We look forward to further developing relationships with other industry leaders like Sainsbury's as we expand our international platform. Concurrent with the announcement of our sale leaseback transaction with Sainsbury's, we increased our 2019 AFFO per share guidance to a range of $3.28 to $3.33 from a prior range of $3.25 to $3.31 and we increased our 2019 acquisition guidance to a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to 261 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 82% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.1% of rental revenue. Convenience store remains our largest industry at 12.2% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.6% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels over the first few years. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a decrease of 30 basis points versus a year ago period. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019. During the quarter we released 71 properties, recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 2,900 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.5% during the quarter. Our projected run rate for 2019 continues to be circa 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul? Paul Meurer : Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Effective in the first quarter we adopted the new lease accounting guidance. And as a result we are now consolidating tenant reimbursement revenue within rental revenue in our income statement. To aid financial statement users we will continue to separately disclose the component of revenue attributable to reimbursable tenant expenses in both our 10-Q and in our financial supplement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursement, was 4.5% for the quarter, below our G&A expenses in the year-ago quarter from both a margin basis and a dollar basis. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 1.3% for the quarter which also remains ahead of our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.82 per share for the quarter, which represents a 3.8% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and of course we remain one of only a few REITs with at least AA rating. During the first quarter we issued $2.2 million of common equity through our dividend reinvestment stock purchase plan. Note that we entered 2019 with a very low leverage after issuing almost $540 million of common equity in the fourth quarter of 2018. We finished this quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.2 billion available on our credit line. Our fixed charge coverage ratio increased from 4.4 times to 4.5 times. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 8.5 years which closely tracks our weighted average remaining lease term. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, selling $19 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2019 and our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt maturing in both 2020 and 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage ratios and excellent liquidity. Now let me turn the call back over to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Paul. I'll now move to our investment activity during the quarter. During the first quarter of 2019 we invested approximately $520 million in 105 properties located in 25 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 17 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 31% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 98.7% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 25 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, automotive services and grocery stores. We closed 25 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy as we sourced approximately $11.7 billion in the first quarter. Investment-grade opportunities represented 31% of the volume sourced for the first quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during first quarter, 53% were portfolios and 47% or approximately $5.0 billion were one-off assets. Of the $519 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 42% of the volume were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the first quarter. Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 261 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our domestic investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. During the first quarter approximately 50% of our acquisitions were sale leaseback transactions and we continue to identify strong corporate partners for future sale-leaseback transactions. As previously mentioned, due to the strength in our current domestic investment pipeline as well as our international expansion, we have raised 2019 acquisition guidance to a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 18 properties for net proceeds of $21.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 5.4%. The low IRR on our disposition activity during the quarter was primarily driven by one sale of vacant property previously leased to a sporting-goods retailer. Absent this disposition, our IRR on dispositions during the quarter was 7.2%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that better fit our investment parameters. We continue to anticipate between $75 million and $100 million dispositions in 2019. In March, we increased the dividend for the 101st time in our Company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 3% increase over the year-ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.1% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Our investment pipeline remains robust and we are excited about the Company's next chapter as we continue to pursue new opportunities for growth, both domestically and internationally. At this time I would like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead. Christy McElroy : Hi, good morning guys. So given that ATM issuance is pretty wide in Q1 relative to your normal pace, wondering if you were in a quiet period given the timing of the Sainsbury deal and would you expect it to pick up again now that the deal has been announced? And maybe have you issued any equity post the announcement? Sumit Roy : Good question, Christy, and you're spot on. Because of the nature of the transaction with regards to Sainsbury's, we were in a blackout period. And so that was the primary reason. The second and equally important reason was in the fourth quarter we had overequitized our balance sheet in anticipation of this particular transaction. So even at the end of the quarter if you look at where the balance sheet is, it's 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA, north of 4.6 times coverage on a fixed charge basis. It leaves the balance sheet in a very good stand. So with regards to capital raising, all avenues are open to us and we will perpetually choose the best available avenue going forward. But those were the primary reasons. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just looking at the occupancy rate ticked down a bit, any main drivers of that that we should be thinking about and maybe comment on sort of what the outlook looks like for the rest of the year? I think you said 80 -- I'm sorry, 98%. But I wasn't sure if that was sort of a year-end number or an average number. Sumit Roy : Yes. Again, good question. These two was anticipated which is why if you look at what we guided The Street and which is what's reflected in our earnings guidance, we had guided The Street to a 98% occupancy number. We had 101 leases expiring in the first quarter which was disproportionately high. And for the remaining three quarters we've got 158 leases expiring. So we anticipated that the 98% was going to come down. As we've always shared with the market that we believe our operational occupancy is right around that 2% ZIP Code. And so having an occupancy number at 98% is what we forecast and is what we believe we're going to be running our business at. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then if I could, just one last quick one. Paul, I thought I heard you mention that you'll continue to disclose the revenue component breakout in the Q also. I'm just curious, will that be in the footnotes or the MD&A? Paul Meurer : So you can see it right now by the way in the supplement so that you have it immediately. Christy McElroy : Right. We have it in the supplement, yes. I'm just curious about what the -- in terms of the Q what the SEC and FASB guided to you in terms of allowing that in the Q? Paul Meurer : It will be in our MD&A. Christy McElroy : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I guess I was just wondering in terms of, you know, when you look at the retail industry in the US, is your thinking evolved on drugstore exposure given what seems like a little tougher operating environment more -- are there any other industries where you might be making more or less of a capital investment based on some changes in the retail environment? Sumit Roy : Good question, Nick. This is a question that we often get asked based on our exposure to the drugstore industry. It continues to be our second largest industry exposure. And it's primarily driven by two operators, Walgreens and CVS. And if you look at Walgreens, for instance, they're generating north of $5 billion in free cash flow. If you look at CVS, it's one of the best operators out there in the drugstore industry. We are very positive of the drugstore business. Is it going through some changes? Absolutely. But we feel, we believe that by and large these two operators are very well-positioned to take advantage of these changes that we see unfolding before our eyes. Some of which, the answers are not very clear, what does the drugstore layout of the future look like today? It's not very clear. But what it is clear is that both CVS as well as Walgreens have made it part of their strategy to figure out how to optimize their stores. If you look at the pharmacy same-store sales growth, they continue to comp positively, both for CVS as well as for Walgreens. And what they're trying to figure out is what to do with the remaining two-thirds of the footprint. And there are experiments under way as to how to optimize that. On the retail side on the front end, is it, should they be focusing more on beauty products? And that has much higher margin and that continues to be a sub segment that continues to do well. And the rest of the footprint, they are trying to figure out how to provide services. That was one of the genesis stated reasons as to why CVS and Aetna merged, is to how to we provide healthcare services, both for acute as well as chronic illnesses, using the footprint that is already available? Another piece that we had is being closer to the consumer, they believe, will be the best way to lower the cost of delivering healthcare. And not all of that has played out, but they're certainly experimenting with different formats et cetera. And we believe these are the two operators that will continue to do well and will figure it out eventually. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just in terms of any sub-sectors within retail where you would like to have less exposure? Sumit Roy : Yes. Look, casual dining continues to be an area that we focus on. It used to represent a very large portion of our portfolio 10 years ago. And today, it's right around 4%, sub-4%. And the ones that we are exposed to, by and large we're very happy with. But that's an area that we continue to be very cautious and an area that we continue to focus on very closely. Anything that falls in the discretionary bucket of retail from furniture stores to other types of discretionary product like sporting goods et cetera, those are again industries that we are very, very cautious in looking at and certainly trying to invest in. And then there are certain other asset types that are much more either demographically driven such as child care centers. We like the child care business, but the format of the 1980s which worked and have been cash flow positive for us and we've gone full cycle, but demographics have shifted in the neighborhoods where some of these concepts seem to have worked 20 years ago but don't seem to work today. Those are assets that we have on our watch list and are looking to dispose off, and at very good total return profiles. A similar story with regards to the format are the kiosk C-stores. We love the C-store business, but we like the 3000-plus square foot convenience store business. And the ones that have these kiosks that essentially sell lottery tickets and tobacco products are ones that we are actively trying to dispose off. So that's the area that I would say that we are either trying to minimize our exposure to or not invest in at all. Nick Yulico : Thank you. Just one last question if I may. On the leasing activity page in the supplement you have where you give the recapture rate, could you give a little bit more detail on the four leases where you had essentially about a 30% markdown in rents? And it says it's without vacancies. So I guess I'm just wondering why if you had a tenant, why you released it at a lower rent? Sumit Roy : Well, those are the ones where the tenant decided not to stay. And for us you're always looking at those assets and trying to come up with the economic scenario of selling those assets vacant or releasing it. And it is not atypical. If you go back and look at our supplemental, to have assets that have even with zero vacancy lease rates that are sub-100%, so the fact that this was right around 70% doesn't really drive the overall profile. We still came out at 105% recapture rate. And as you can see, it's largely driven by leases with tenants that choose to exercise the existing options. And for us that's really the crux of what we are trying to underwrite, it is to make sure that the retail product continues to be of relevance to the existing tenant because they exercise those options, those options tend to have growth in them and that is the best way for us to recapture a positive spread with almost always zero dollars of additional investment. But in situations when we have had vacancy or even with no vacancy, when you're trying to attract new tenants, sometimes taking a 30% drop in a recapture rate proves out or at least to our analysis proves it to be a much better economic outcome than trying to sell those assets vacant. And that's the story behind that. Nick Yulico : Okay, appreciate it, thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Our next question will come from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead. Rob Stevenson : Good afternoon guys. Just follow-up on Nick's question. So there's roughly 100 vacant assets in the portfolio. I mean what's the sort of mix between what you guys expect the retenant versus market for sale? Sumit Roy : It's been roughly, if you look at it historically speaking, 80% of every lease that comes up for renewal gets exercised by the existing tenant. I would say 10% to 15% of the remaining leases we end up leasing to new tenants and 5% to 10% we end up selling. More recently that mix have shifted. We are tending to dispose off assets, vacant assets because we feel like the economic recapture rate is superior to going down the path of releasing it, and for Nick's question, releasing it at levels that don't make a lot of sense. And in some cases we are holding on to vacant assets and this is where some of our active asset management comes into play because we believe we can reposition those assets and actually recapture well north of the expiring rents. But that does take time and which is why we have said that our frictional vacancy rate is right around that 2% because we are more than happy holding on to these assets and repositioning them and potentially holding them for 18 months to two years because we believe that the economic outcome in those areas is superior to either retenanting it as it is or selling it vacant. Rob Stevenson : Okay. What's your thoughts on adding casinos or hotel assets in the portfolio? Sumit Roy : Good question. There are players in our space that are dedicated to pursuing casinos. We feel like they're very well suited to pursue that strategy. We obviously monitor the asset type, but we really don't have a thesis at this point as to whether we will do anything about entering into that front. Rob Stevenson : And hotels as well? Sumit Roy : Yes, I would put both of them in the same bucket. Rob Stevenson : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Collin Mings of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Great, thank you. Last week you provide a lot of detail an the opportunity to grow in Europe, I guess, where you want to take your international platform. Where could Canada fit in? Are you evaluating any opportunities there as well? Sumit Roy : We've always looked at Canada. We've looked at countries south of the border as well and we've not been able to pencil the economics. And then the product that is available in these alternative geographies haven't been the ones that we have wanted to pursue based on the economic profile. But look, I mean one of the main reasons why we wanted to provide all that detail, Collin, was to make sure that you understood the thesis behind why we chose to go into the UK and potentially into mainland Europe. And it's because the economics do pencil and in fact they pencil very well especially given the current environment and the product lends itself to what it is that we've been pursuing here in the US. And so this is truly the way we think about, you know, if you're going to change anything or if you're going to introduce any level of new paths for us to pursue, it needs to sort of be along the lines of what we have presented as to why we chose the same space of portfolio. And so this was a long and drawn out way of answering that, yes, Canada certainly is one of the countries that we have looked at in the past and if the right product with the right economic profile comes along, we will absolutely pursue it, but we haven't been able to find one yet. Collin Mings : Okay. It doesn't sound like there's any bigger push now that you've established an international platform necessarily to go in that direction, is that fair? Sumit Roy : It's now that we've done, more people are aware of the fact that we're open to doing it. So I would say that that's not entirely fair, Collin. We are certainly getting a lot more inbound calls as was expected and so transactions perhaps that we may not have seen because people weren't aware that we were a potential player in the past. That dynamic has changed. And, which was completely expected and the team here is ready to respond to those calls. So, time will tell. Collin Mings : Great. That's actually very helpful clarification there. Just switching to investment activity during the quarter, there really weren't huge moves in your top tenant roster just on as far as the Dollar General property, obviously that was up somewhat notably. Maybe just take a second and kind of, if there's any additional color you can provide there and then talk about just Dollar Stores exposure overall at this point? Sumit Roy : Yes. A lot of it was parts of small portfolios that we acquired. We continue to like Dollar Tree and Dollar General. Both of those are operators that's filling a very specific mission to market and they are both outstanding operators in our mind. Dollar Tree has taken a bit longer than any of us had expected to sort of unfold Family Dollar, but that is now well on its way and all signs are that those are the two operators that we want to continue to partner with. Having said that, I think our exposure to that business is right around 5.2%. And will we propitiously grow that piece? Absolutely, with the right trends, with the right growth profile. We will absolutely continue to look to grow that. But we are not going to actively pursue these development-driven Family Dollar, Dollar General, Dollar Tree assets because those tend to not to be the type of assets with the right type of leases in terms of the triple-net nature that we like to pursue. Collin Mings : Okay. Thank you very much for the color. Operator : Our next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford : Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering, Sumit, should we still expect to see broaden your verticals out in the US this year or do you feel like you have enough on your plate with the international initiative that you announced? Sumit Roy : I'm smiling, Karin. Last week we came out with something huge and our hope is that we will continue to explore. And the timing is what remains uncertain as to whether it's going to be next quarter or next month or maybe even a year from now that we can come up with something different. This international foray is a big step for us. It does increase the potential market from $4 trillion to potentially $12 trillion now and we want to make sure that we do this it right on the international front. But that certainly does not preclude us from continuing to explore some of other paths that we have been exploring over the last three months. And if something does take shape and becomes actionable and we decide to pursue it, we will again do something similar to what we did last week and come and share that with you. But I can't really tell you what the timing on some of those other avenues are going to be and I think I had been asked this question before as to why not, and the answer is pretty obvious because some of these avenues that we are pursuing today we may choose not to after we've done our diligence and, or all the product doesn't lend itself to those avenues even if the avenue seems to theoretically makes a lot of sense. So that's tied down to that question, Karin. Karin Ford : Understood. Appreciate that. My second question is along the same line. You've generated very consistent FFO and dividend growth over the years with below average volatility. Is one of the goals of the new strategic initiatives to push earnings growth higher than it has been historically? Sumit Roy : No. Look, I think our only goal was to continue to look at expanding the potential viable investment set. The idea here is to not compromise on either our balance sheet strategy or the types of businesses that we are pursuing with the profile of the businesses that we are pursuing. I mean, those remain intact, Karin. I think most people who invest in us, they invest in us because of the fact that we have this low-vol, dependable growth business. And I don't think we're going to compromise on that particular front. But that does not preclude us from looking at new avenues of growth. That sort of lend itself to this profile that we've designed for ourselves. And there is in certain products we believe a mismatch where the perception may be that it tends to be higher risk or higher volatility and it's for us to then -- if we decide to pursue that to-- if we decide to pursue that, it is on us to then show to you why we believe that it's sort of falls in line with the profile that we've designed for ourselves. So for us growth is really an output of this exercise rather than the driver of this exercise, and that is nuanced but something very, very important to us. Karin Ford : Thanks for taking my questions. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from John Massocca of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. John Massocca : Good afternoon. Sumit Roy : Hi, John. John Massocca : So, as you stated investment-grade rated assets as a percentage of acquisitions came down or a little bit low this quarter maybe versus kind of what you've done in the first nine months of 2018. Was this a similar situation to 4Q 2018 where it was just the mix and there's a lot of assets in there that simply aren't rated? Or was there maybe a better risk-adjusted return you felt you were getting by going after sub-investment grade-rated companies? Sumit Roy : Yes. I would say that a lot of them fell into this non-rated bucket. And given our conservative nature, we obviously do our own underwriting to figure out what the implied rating would be if there were to be rated. But we categorized them as sub-investment grade for your purposes. And so, look, again, people have often said we only pursue investment grade-rated tenants that is and we compromise on growth and on initial yield but that has never been what we've done. Again, this is an output of the strategy that we have put in place and it just happens to be that a lot of the assets that we closed on in the first quarter have a profile that again low-vol, predictable business models that have high drop to breakeven in sales if it's a variable cost business or -- sorry, I said it the opposite way. And that is very important to us. But just because we had a 30% investment grade-rated tenants in the first quarter, that really was the output of the types of products that we ended up closing on. But the industry and we've shared that with you, the industries that they belong to, the tenants that they happen to be, these are tenants that are very high quality and somebody mentioned LifeTime Fitness, that\u2019s a business that we really like and they are well north of the coverage ratio -- rent coverage ratios that our overall portfolio has and their breakeven in drop to sales is over 40%, but yet that's going to fall in the non-investment grade-rated bucket because it's a private company that doesn't have a rating. So I wouldn't look anything into that particular number. It is going to continue to move around and a perfect example would be Sainsbury's next quarter. It's a non-rated company but if you run the metrics through the S&P credit model which is what we did, it would be rated investment-grade. But there again, that's a very large transaction that is going to not have the investment grade, it won't be part of that investment-grade profile. Hopefully that helps. John Massocca : No, that makes complete sense. And then, can you maybe provide a little color on any tenant credit-driven vacancy in the quarter? If I heard you right, you had 101 leases expire. If I kind of look on page 21 of the sup, that would imply there were around 10 or so assets that were vacant because of -- not because of the expiring leases but because of tenant credit. What drove that? I know it's not a huge number, but just any color there would be helpful. Sumit Roy : Sure. Happy to address that. We have eight Shopco assets and these were largely second-generation assets for us. And few of those 10-odd came from the Shopco assets. And we expect most of them to come back to us. But it is -- I want to say 17 basis points of rent. So completely immaterial, but those definitely drove some of that 101 vacancies. John Massocca : I appreciate the color. That's it from me. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford : Hi, just one quick one for Paul. Any plans to refinance the line balance later on this year with the bond deal? And are you considering a commercial paper program or forward equity? Paul Meurer : Yes. Well, as Sumit commented earlier, we obviously given the new Sainsbury's we felt compelled to not issue new capital in Q1, thinking that that was material information for a potential equity investor, for example. In addition, we had raised a fair amount of capital end of last year. So we sit here today with that $800 million plus balance, but it is a $3 billion line, so we have plenty of liquidity. We don't feel compelled per se relative to a need for capital relative to our acquisition pipeline in the near term or anything of that sort. And all forms of capital are available to us. So, equity, bonds, each are really well priced right now. Bonds are something, let's say, by year-end we would certainly be considering as part of the mix. Typically our mix is going to be two-thirds plus of equity and the remainder thinking about unsecured bonds. So we could definitely see that as a part of it in. And the relative to commercial paper, it's kind of on that list of new ideas that we are looking into and considering. And it's something I think is very possibly part of our future, but you won't see it in the immediate near term. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I'll now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone in a few weeks at ICSC and in the summer at NAREIT. Thank you everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Andrew Crum : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's second quarter 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference, we will make statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. We are pleased to complete another solid quarter on a very solid first half of 2019. During the quarter, we invested approximately 1.1 billion in high quality real estate at investment spreads well above our historical average. Which brings us to $1.6 billion invested during the first half of the year. Of the 1.1 billion invested during the quarter, $549 million or approximately 434 million British pounds was invested in the United Kingdom through a sale leaseback transaction with Sainsbury's. We plan to continue to grow our international platform as we are well positioned to capitalize on a significant addressable market in the UK, and mainland Europe. Given our portable size, scale, and cost of capital advantages, we believe we have a unique ability to execute sizable portfolio transactions with best in class operators. We look forward to further developing relationships with other industry leaders like Sainsbury's, as we expand our international platform. To finance our robust investment activity. We raised $1.9 billion of attractively priced capital during the quarter, including $1 billion of equity. We entered the second half of 2019 very well positioned with virtually full availability on our $3 billion line and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.4 times. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property ties, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased 265 commercial tenants in 49 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico, and the UK. 82.5% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial property at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.8% of rental revenue. Convenience Store remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and our low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent US retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio or our retail properties is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.65% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, flat versus the prior quarter. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019. During the quarter, we re-leased 86 properties recapturing 100.4% of the expiring rent. During the first half of 2019, we re-leased 157 properties, recapturing 102.2% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,000 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.5% for the first half of the year. Our projected runway for 2019 continues to be approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul Meurer : Thanks Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 5.3% for the quarter and 4.9% year to date, both of which were below comparable year-ago periods. Consistent with prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year due to the timing of stock vesting and costs associated with our annual meeting and proxy. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 1.4% for the quarter and 1.3% year to date, which is better than our full-year expectation in a 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was 82 cents per share for the quarter, which represents a 2.5% increase Briefly turning to the balance sheet and we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, and we remain one of only a few REITs with at least AA ratings. As Sumit mentioned during the second quarter, we raised approximately $1.9 billion of favorable price long-term capital to fund our acquisition activity. In May, we issued 315 million of sterling denominated 15-year senior unsecured notes via private placement at a yield of 2.73%. Proceeds from the offering allowed us to partially finance the acquisition of the Sainsbury's portfolio in the UK. We were pleased with the pricing and high quality order book for our first ever private offering. And we very much appreciate the support of the investors who participated. The sterling denominated offering allowed us to finance the Sainsbury's transaction with a natural currency hedge, while taking advantage of low interest rates abroad. In June, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a yield of 3.33%. The offering allowed us to term out borrowing on our revolving credit facility and the bonds fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we have no other maturities in 2029. During the second quarter, we issued approximately $1 billion of common equity through a combination of overnight and ATM offerings. And thus we finished the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.4 times and virtually full availability of our $3 billion revolver. Our fixed-charge coverage remains healthy at 4.4 times, and the weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 8.8 years, which closely tracks our weighted average remaining lease term. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $18 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt, maturing in both 2020 and 2021. So, in summary, our balance sheets in great shape, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics, and excellent liquidity. And now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Paul. During the second quarter of 2019, we invested approximately 1.1 billion in 102 properties located in 28 states and the United Kingdom at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 12% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 99% of their revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented our UK grocery stores, theaters, and automotive services. We closed 20 discrete transactions in the second quarter, and approximately 86% of second quarter investment volume was sale leaseback transactions. Of the 1.1 billion invested during the quarter, $546 million was invested domestically in 90 properties at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. International investments during the quarter were $549 million or approximately 434 million pounds in 12 properties as at average initial cash cap rate of 5.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. All 12 International properties are leased to Sainsbury's, a top grocer in the UK. Year-to-date 2019, we invested 1.6 billion US dollars in 199 properties located in 34 states and the United Kingdom at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.6 years. On a revenue basis, 80% [ph] of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 99% of the revenues are generated from retail and 1% are from industrial. Of the 45 independent transactions closed year-to-date, four transactions were above 50 million US. Approximately 74% of our year-to-date investment volume was sale leaseback transactions. Of the $1.6 billion invested year-to-date, nearly $1.1 billion was invested domestically in 187 properties at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term 15.9 years. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, as we sourced approximately $19.1 billion in the second quarter. Investment-grade opportunities represented 29% of the volume sourced for the second quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 34% were portfolios and 66% or approximately 12.6 billion were one-off assets. Of the $19.1 billion sourced during the quarter, $15.9 billion were domestic opportunities and $3.2 billion were international opportunities. Year-to-date 2019, we have sourced approximately $30.8 billion in potential transactions. Of these opportunities, 41% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 59% or approximately $18 billion were one-off assets. Of the $1.1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 13% of the volume was one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates in the US were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the types of assets we are targeting, investment-grade or implied investment-grade properties are trading from the low 4% to mid 5% cap rate range. Non-investment-grade properties are trading from 5% to low 7% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 290 basis points for domestic investments and 209 basis points for international investments, both of which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less a nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our invested pipeline remains robust. And we remain the only publicly-traded net lease company that has the size, scale, and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Based on our robust investment pipeline, we continue to expect 2019 acquisition guidance at $2 billion to $2.5 billion Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter, we sold 18 properties for net proceeds of $28.6 million at net cash cap rate of 7.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%. This brings us to 36 properties sold year-to-date for $50 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.8%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that benefit our investment parameters. We anticipate between 75 million and 100 million of dispositions in 2019. In June, we increased the dividend for the 102nd time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year-ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.2% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994. growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in S&P high-yield dividend aristocrats index. To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Our investment pipeline remains strong, and we are well positioned to pursue new opportunities for growth both domestically and internationally. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Looks like our first question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. Sumit, based on some prior commentary, it seemed like acquisition -- an acquisition guidance range was possibly on the table for this year. How are you thinking about acquisition range today? Has the environment -- investment environment become more competitive with lower interest rates? And any color would be appreciated there. Sumit Roy : Sure. As of today, we have obviously reaffirmed our acquisition guidance. If you look at the sourcing we've done year-to-date, it is at historic levels, especially if you just focus on the domestic side. We've done 27 billion US dollars of domestic sourcing, and it's through the end of June, which on a run rate basis is going to be far beyond the high 30 million that we have sourced historically. Yes, the market is competitive, but the cost of capital allows us to continue to win our share of deals, and we feel very comfortable about the pipeline that we have today and about the guidance range that we have shared with you. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And just following up on some other guidance items. Paul, as you noted with your opening comments, property expenses have been lower than the full year range. On the opposite side, same-store rent growth have been higher. Should we take that to mean that there's going to be some slowdown in the back half of the year? Or how should we interpret first half results versus full year guidance? Paul Meurer : No, I think both of those are running favorably. And we would probably lean towards both of those doing -- doing well the remainder of the year but not such that we thought it was prudent to make a specific change in that guidance at this time. But I certainly wouldn't -- wouldn't think of a downturn in either of those areas to normalize back at where our guidance is. We've been pleased with the same-store rent growth this year, partly related to just the timing of contractual rent bumps this year. But in addition, with property expenses running lower, we suspect both of those trends will continue through the remainder of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Katy McConnell : Good morning, this is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Can you provide some color on the types of international deals that you're looking at or underwriting today? And how are you thinking about the rest of the year, as far as the mix between deals that you could potentially do in the US versus abroad? Sumit Roy : The vast majority of the deals that we're going to be doing will be US focused, you know, and I touched -- to the previous person, I'd answer the question with regards to why we feel so optimistic about you know, the -- the deal flow here in the US, it's -- it's -- it has been at historical levels. With respect to the UK, we continue to see transactions and the volume that we have seen has exceeded our original underwriting. I'm not in a position today to tell you precisely the transactions we're going to be, you know, getting over the finish line. But suffice it to say that it wouldn't be, you know, out of the realm of possibility to do a few more transactions in the UK.  You know, our goal when we first did the Sainsbury sale leaseback was to establish our footprint in the UK, to make sure that we had our processes in place. And having closed this transaction, closed the books in the second quarter with the financials, we feel very good about where we stand today. [Technical Difficulty] resourced in the UK, like I said was above [indiscernible] range is right around $2.5 billion, that's $900 million delta from where we are today. I would say the vast majority will still be US focused, but some of it will certainly be from the UK. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Kevin Egan : Hi, this is Kevin on for Vikram. Just a quick question for me. I know that the original underwriting of the Sainsbury transaction, I believe it was $1.30 what was going to be represented to be a British pound. I know now it's about $1.22, I know the vast majority of the 85% is hedged, but in terms of the remaining 15%, is there anything there that we should be thinking about? Sumit Roy : No, because if you recall, the way we structured the transaction, the entire principal balance was 100% hedged and 85% of the cash flows that we are generating on an annual basis is also hedged. And keep in mind that, you know, off the financing, only 30% of the financing was equity based. We finance 70% of the transaction using domestic GDP denominated debt. So we feel very comfortable that, you know, the volatility that you see in the currency market has next to not zero but very, very limited impact on our cash flow statement. And the 15% that remains on hedge we are going to continue to keep it in the UK. And you know, you heard my previous answer. We have seen plenty of deals flow to be able to invest, reinvest those proceeds. So, you know, the volatility is going to have very little impact and zero cash flow impact. Kevin Egan : Okay, so is it safe to assume then that the remaining 15% it's not hedged? Basically, just it is not repatriated [indiscernible] [00:21:49] going forward, you think? Sumit Roy : Absolutely. That is absolutely going to be our strategy going forward. Kevin Egan : Okay, and then just one last for me, I noticed there was a slight uptick in impairment, I think it was impairment charge of about 13 million. Can you give us any color on what that was about? Paul Meurer : You'll see a few more impairments when you think about how much larger our company has gotten size of company, size of the asset, base, etc. So you'll -- you'll -- you'll have a little bit larger number there. But it's also related to what I would describe as more aggressive asset management approach on our part, to work through assets much more quickly, to the extent that we don't see a releasable opportunity or a -- an opportunity for redevelopment that we will, you know, sell something a little quicker, maybe then we wouldn't have passed and redeploy that capital. So kind of along those lines. Obviously, it's a non-cash impact to the company. And just one statistic to kind of give it some materiality context. And since 2012, it's only represented about 0.1% of our gross book value. So it's really not a significant issue for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Rob Stevenson with Janney Capital. Rob Stevenson : Good afternoon, guys. Given the robust pricing on several industrial deals over the last few months and the amount of capital chasing those deals, have you guys thought about selling either part or all the industrial portfolio and redeploying that capital into higher yielding retail assets, given where your yields are on domestic retail? Sumit Roy : We decided to go down this path of diversifying across asset types in 2010. It has held us in very good stead. Despite some of the, you know, higher cap rates you have on the retail side, I can tell you that some of the opportunities that we've been able to uncover on the industrial side has created tremendous value for the company. And, in fact, you know, a lot of which you see coming through what our asset management team is currently being doing. So, you know, our long term, you know, and we believe that the long-term value creation is -- is not necessarily going to be driven by trying to time markets and maximize IRRs. We believe we can maximize IRRs playing the long game. And as long as we hold the right industrial assets with the right tenants in the right markets, we will create similar if not superior value for the company. So, yes, we could -- we could sell a -- you know, our -- our entire industrial portfolio at incredibly aggressive cap rates, but that is not really our business strategy. Rob Stevenson : Okay, and then looking to Europe, main, how much of what you're looking at today and tomorrow are going to wind up being office industrial versus traditional retail. And are you guys going to need this to take up headcount over there and pick up G&A to accomplish what you want to get to? Sumit Roy : I\u2019ll answer the last bit first. My focus has been to bring down our G&A from the run rate that you have seen in the company over the last couple of years, which has been right around 5%. And our goal for 2019 is to make sure that it is below 5%. So regardless of what we do, in terms of, you know, being able to right size the -- the team in the UK, to help manage UK and the rest of Europe, that is not going to change that objective for the company will not change. You are absolutely right that we are in the process of building out the team in the UK, I think I've already spoken about having one of our acquisition team members, a senior acquisition team member move to the UK to basically see the office there. And we are in the process of supplementing that team with one additional person, that's going to be the scope initially. And the rest of the servicing, such as on the accounting side, etc. We felt like an outsourced model, at least today, is far better and more cost effective strategy than to sort of bring that in house. But the goal is there is going to be an inflection point, and that is going to be dictated by the assets that we continue to buy and the portfolio that we build. And where it makes sense, we will bring those functions in house. But the goal is not to do that day -- day one. It's to do it over time and let the portfolio dictate when that's going to occur. Rob Stevenson : And then the -- the question about the mix in terms of Europe, in terms of retail versus office industrial? Are you targeting office industrial over there now? Sumit Roy : Yeah, sorry, it's old age, forgetting parts of questions. Look, we've always said that we are predominantly a retail oriented company and we love the industrial product. Lon-term leases with tenants that we want to do business with. Those are primarily going to be the two asset types that we're going to continue to pursue. I'm not going to say no office. But office we have stated very clearly and unequivocally that here in the US, investing in office has not been a core strategy of ours. And, in fact, over time, our portfolio for office assets has dwindled. And so, I don't believe that that will change just because the geography has changed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Hawthorne : Hi, how does the volatile currency fluctuations impact your ability to make acquisitions? Is there a certain level that -- that starts to either slow or help you guys out? Sumit Roy : Well, the trend that it's going certainly helps us. You know, the pound continues to depreciate vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar. And, you know, the value creation opportunities just continues to accrue to us. The question is, you know, what's the long game, but today, as long as your view on the tail risk of Brexit is not draconian and some of that gets mitigated by where you invest, i.e. non-discretionary operators, then I think, you know, and this is our -- our house view that it is a very propitious environment for us to continue to invest and create tremendous value for our shareholders. So, the current environment actually is, unfortunately, it's tough to say that, but from an economic perspective, it's the right environment for us to be investing in because we do have unprecedented spreads that we can sort of realize for our investments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. John Massocca : Good afternoon, and good morning still in San Diego. Sumit Roy : Good afternoon. John Massocca : Just about. Yeah. Were all of the $3.2 billion of international transactions sourced in the quarter in the UK or any of the transactions in Western Europe? Sumit Roy : Yeah, predominantly the UK, there was one transaction we saw in Spain, but the vast majority of that $3.2 billion was UK. John Massocca : Okay and then could you maybe provide some color on the increase exposure to the theater industry and Regal in particular and if it was one individual transaction, what was the rough size of the transaction and what kind of maybe was the impact that had on your reported domestic acquisition cap rate? Sumit Roy : I'll answer that last piece first. By and large theater transactions occur in the low to mid 7% cap rate range. So you can assume comfortably that this particular sale leaseback that we did was in that range. So, this was a sale leaseback that's Sinovel ran, and we were very comfortable with the 17 assets that we looked at. We looked at their profitability per screen, their sales per screen. We looked at the demos and this was right down the fairway for us in terms of what are the qualities that we look for in theater assets, and so the size of this was roughly $280 million, $290 million and like I said, these are precisely the type of assets that that we would have gone out and picked off on a one-off basis. But having it delivered to us as a portfolio by Cinema World. It was something that we really liked and we felt like it was priced appropriately and we were very happy with the transaction. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Thanks. And just to stay on the Regal, any specifics on the lease, maybe the term? And then any annual escalators tucked in there? Sumit Roy : Yeah. I believe these were 15-year leases. We had annual escalators. We don't want to make it a precedent talk to talk about specific transactions, but you can assume that the cash flow coverages were not of where we typically see these assets. These were 15-year leases with annual growth and on pretty much all of the metrics that you would want to measure theaters, this was either at or superseding our hurdle rate and so right down the fairway really. Todd Stender : Okay Pretty clean. Thanks, Sumit. And then Paul you did the debut offering. I guess the private placement on the UK at 15 years, but you've got the A-rating here. Is it-- to do the private placement, is that would you do first? Is there an order of operations and then the next offering is the public bond, you just have to grease the wheels, so to speak with investors over there? What would be teed up next? Paul Meurer : Yeah, I mean, not necessarily. So what we did was we wanted to create a natural currency hedge. So we wanted to do predominantly debt financing for that purpose. And we looked at all the alternatives, whether that be a public bond offering, a private placement offering, mortgage debt and the private placement offering was the one that was most favorable in terms of the depth of that market, the size of what we could do, the flexibility with the maturity and then of course the pricing was excellent. And what was fascinating was, it was really the same investors that we know real, real well. US life insurance companies that we have a terrific relationship with on the unsecured public bond side here in the US and essentially we were talking to those same shops. So we were kind of an improved credit with them. They were again quite amenable to a maturity length that we wanted, which was the 15 year. We wanted to do that to match more so the lease length of course. And the depth of that market we uncovered is quite significant. Longer term, could we consider public bond offering there entering that market in that fashion. That certainly feels like something we'd want to explore. I think we'd want to probably build up a little bit more of a local brand and commitment to the market before making that decision. But in the meantime, there is plenty of depth in the private placement side, the pricing is excellent and we\u2019re real pleased with how that went. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Chris Lucas : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a quick one. Paul, you had noted that the same growth profile was impacted by, I guess, some timing on rent bumps. I guess just thinking about this over the longer haul, is the 1.5% rate that you guys are -- seem to be running at this year, is this something that we can expect going forward? Or is this more of an anomaly within the sort of more traditional 1% bump rate that you guys have generated historically? Sumit Roy : Yeah, Paul's been kind in letting me answer that question, Chris. So forgive me. You know what happened in the second quarter and this is very straightforward. Quite a few of our leases don't have annual growth built into them. They have step growth, which could be every three years, every five years and that's typically how some of the leases are structured. And what we noticed in the second quarter was that of all -- if you were to compare it to second quarter of 2018, there were 15% more leases that had this step growth that just coincidentally happened to fall in the second quarter, which is what resulted in that 1.5%. And so now that they've had that growth in the second quarter of 2019, you're not going to see that the following year. And that's the reason why we continue to believe that, this year, yes, is it possible that it is slightly not at 1%? Yes, but our run rate within our portfolio, we have always said is right around 1%. And that's -- that continues to be the case. Chris Lucas : Okay, great. Thank you, Sumit. And then I guess while I have you, on the portfolio pricing of the theaters, I guess, just more generally, your cap rates first quarter were sort of better than last year\u2019s. Certainly, the domestic cap rates this quarter were better than sort of last year's average, rates are down relative to last year. I guess, I'm just wondering, sort of, is it just purely just sort of the mix issue that you're dealing with this year versus last year? Or is there some value to portfolio pricing that you're seeing that maybe is being more predominant this year versus last year? I'm just trying to kind of get a understanding between last year\u2019s results and this year\u2019s? Sumit Roy : Sure. Very good question, Chris. We don't see too much of a movement in the portfolio discount that we saw last year versus this year. The reason why you see higher cap rates, it's predominantly a question around the mix of assets, the type of tenants, the type of properties that we've been buying. As we've talked about the theater assets, they tend to be higher cap rate assets, some of the other assets that we've closed on, they just tend to have higher yields on the high-6s, low-7s, mid-7s in some cases. I think that has predominantly driven our overall cap rate than seeing shifts in cap rate. Having said that, we're certainly seeing intra property like within certain sub sectors in retail, cap rates have moved, and in some cases, they've gotten more aggressive, as you would expect, given the current environment. And in some cases, they've remained flat. But by and large, the opening remarks that I've made around cap rates remaining somewhat steady is true for us, despite the fact that you're seeing us amplify cap rates that are higher on what we have closed. But that's predominantly driven by the mix. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe just following up on that last question. You're talking about how the certain mix of assets has impacted your cap rates so far this year on acquisitions. I guess going forward, do you expect to continue that potentially Numix called it or do you think you could go back to what you've done more historically? Sumit Roy : Caitlin, we always like higher cap rates, but it needs to fit our investment thesis. And like I answered Chris's question, it just so happened that everything aligned and the mix that we're looking for, the opportunities that we saw that fit our transaction -- our acquisition criteria, it just happened to trade at higher cap rates. I'd love to be able to tell you that we\u2019ve continued to see that same mix and we'll be able to continue to post high 6% cap rates and therefore create more value, but some of it is driven by the opportunities available in the market. And so I wouldn't necessarily count on that. But we are not averse to continuing to do transactions, just because it has a higher yield, as long as it fits our investment philosophy. Caitlin Burrows : And then maybe just on the volume or deal flow side. I know, you mentioned earlier that you were seeing historical, very high levels of domestic deal flow. So just wondering, is there anything you can think of that's driving that, in particular, and do you expect that activity levels to continue? Sumit Roy : I do think, even if we were to sort of normalize over the next six months, this year could turn out to be one of the highest year that, not the highest year in terms of sourcing, some of our sourcing is of course, going to get supplemented by what we are seeing in the UK as well, which we haven't had in years past. But, do I see a particular trend in the market? No, that I can point to that sort of answers as to why we're seeing this unprecedented volume of sourcing. It just happens to be the case. We know that there are larger portfolios that have come to market, there are a lot of opco, propco situations that we find ourselves discussing with potential operators on. So it's, for whatever reason we find ourselves at a point with the cost of capital and the scale to be able to act on it, so we are very excited about it. But I can't really point to any one variable that is causing this phenomena, it's just, it is what we see and we're very excited about it. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of the Realty Income conference call. I would now like to turn the call back to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Carry. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope everyone continues to enjoy the rest of the summer. And we look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming conferences. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After speaker's presentation, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Crum, Senior Associate Realty Income. You may begin. Andrew Crum : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from any of the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Andrew. Welcome everyone. We are pleased to complete another solid quarter. We remain on track for a very strong 2019 and are well positioned as we look towards 2020 with a robust investment pipeline and strong liquidity. During the quarter, we invested approximately $412 million in high-quality real estate at investment spreads well above our historical average which brings us to approximately $2 billion invested as we enter the fourth quarter. Our investment activity during the quarter included our second international acquisition in the U.K. Additionally, our investments during the quarter were 51% industrial by rent with approximately $234 million invested through three separate transactions with three new investment grade-rated tenants including our first-ever distribution facility leased to a large e-commerce retailer. Including the previously announced portfolio acquisition from CIM Real Estate Finance Trust we have announced over $3 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. As a reminder, the CIM transaction is expected to close in various tranches with the acquisition of most of the properties in the portfolio expected to close in 2019. To fund our activity we raised $572 million in equity capital during the quarter ending the quarter with $236 million of cash on hand and positioning our balance sheet favorably for the remainder of the year and as we look towards 2020. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end our properties were leased to 274 commercial tenants in 49 different industries located in 49 states Puerto Rico and the U.K. 82.7% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience store remains our largest industry at 11.6% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail portfolio is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.7% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3% flat versus the prior quarter. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019. During the quarter, we re-leased 29 properties recapturing 101.5% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date we have re-leased 186 properties recapturing 102.1% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,100 properties with leases expiring recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.2% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. Our projected run rate for 2019 continues to be approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul Meurer : Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue excluding reimbursements was 4.6% for the quarter and 4.8% year-to-date both of which were below the comparable year ago periods. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements was 1.3% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, which is better than our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.83 per share for the quarter, which represents a 2.5% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and we remain one of only a few REITs with at least two A ratings. As Sumit mentioned, during the third quarter, we raised approximately $572 million of common equity almost entirely through our ATM program. Use of proceeds were repaid borrowings on our line of credit and to pre-fund an active acquisition pipeline, including of course the large CIM portfolio acquisition. We finished the quarter with nothing outstanding on our $3 billion line of credit and approximately $236 million of cash on hand. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.0 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, as the weighted average maturity of our bonds is 8.5 years and we have only $1.2 million of debt coming due in the remainder of 2019. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt maturing in both 2020 and 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity. Now let me turn the call back over to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Paul. During the third quarter of 2019, we invested approximately $412 million in 51 properties located in 23 states in the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. On a total revenue basis approximately 56% of total acquisitions are from investment grade-rated tenants. 49% of the revenues are generated from retail and 51% are generated from industrial. The weighted average initial cash cap rate on industrial acquisitions during the quarter was in the low 5% range, while the weighted average cap rate on retail acquisitions was in the mid 6% range. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are general merchandise, food processing and childcare. We closed 15 discrete transactions in the third quarter and approximately 23% of the third quarter investment volume were sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $412 million invested during the quarter, $384 million was invested domestically in 50 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years. During the quarter, $27.6 million was invested internationally in one property located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 4.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 20.6 years. Year-to-date 2019, we invested $2 billion in 241 properties, located in 38 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. On a revenue basis, 25% of total acquisitions are from investment grade-rated tenants. 90% of the revenues are generated from retail and 10% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 19 industries. Of the 60 independent transactions closed year-to-date, six transactions were above $50 million. Approximately 65% of our year-to-date investment for volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $2 billion invested year-to-date, nearly $1.5 billion was invested domestically in 228 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.7 years. Year-to-date approximately $577 million has been invested internationally in 13 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $15 billion in the third quarter. Of the $15 billion sourced during the quarter, $9 billion were domestic opportunities and $6 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 33% of the volume sourced for the third quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 31% were portfolios and 69% or approximately $10.4 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date 2019, we have sourced $45.4 billion in potential transaction opportunities, which marks the highest annual volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, $35.6 billion were domestic opportunities and $9.9 billion were international opportunities. This continues to confirm our belief that our investment -- international investment pipeline is truly incremental to our domestic business. Of the $45.4 billion sourced year-to-date, 38% were portfolios and 62% or approximately $28.2 billion were one-off assets. Of the $412 million in total acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 84% were one-off transactions. As to pricing cap rates in the U.S. were essentially unchanged in the third quarter. Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the types of assets we are targeting, investment-grade or implied investment-grade properties are trading from the low 4% to high 5% cap rate range. Non-investment-grade properties are trading from mid-4% to low 7% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter averaging approximately 198 basis points for domestic investments and 188 basis points for international investments both of which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline remains robust and we believe we are the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. We were pleased to announce a diversified portfolio acquisition from CIM Real Estate Finance Trust for approximately $1.25 billion during the quarter, which further demonstrates the advantages of size and scale in the net lease industry. We continue to expect 2019 acquisition guideline -- guidance of $3.25 billion to $3.5 billion. Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 27 properties for net proceeds of $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.4% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.6%. This brings us to 63 properties sold year-to-date for $71.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.1%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of nonstrategic assets recycling the sales proceeds into properties that better fit our investment parameters. We continue to expect between $75 million and $100 million of dispositions in 2019. In September, we increased the dividend for the 103rd time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.2% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.5%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter and are very well-positioned as we look towards 2020. Our portfolio continues to perform well, our investment pipeline remains healthy and we are conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to pursue additional growth initiatives. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy : Hi. Thanks, guys. Just following up on your comments on the industrial acquisitions in Q3. How much of the volume of the industrial deals was the large e-commerce retailer that you referred to? And what was the difference in cap rate on that deal versus the other industrial deals? Sumit Roy : That's represented approximately 40% of the overall investments in industrial. And the cap rates in all three assets were fairly close to each other. They were right around slightly north of 5%. Christy McElroy : Is there more to do with this or other large e-commerce retailers? And how do you think about that, sort of, investment relative to your -- historically what you've done in industrial and kind of relative to what you do in retail? Sumit Roy : Look, we've always said that there are two asset types that we are very focused on retail obviously being the bread and butter and the preponderance of what we do and that will always be the case. But industrial continues to be an asset type that we are very attracted to. There are points in time where we can make investments in very high-quality tenants with growth rates embedded in these leases that are well above what we have in our overall portfolio with very long-term leases. And that is a very attractive proposition for us, especially, when we can finance it and capture spreads right around our long-term averages, which is precisely what we were able to accomplish this particular quarter. So we were very happy with the ability to transact, especially on these three assets and -- with some of the provisions that I've shared with you it made it that much more attractive. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just lastly on the funding for the CIM acquisition and other, sort of, incremental deal volume in Q4. We could see where you're at Q3. And from a funding perspective you closed on an additional billion or you closed on that first billion tranche from CIM after Q3. And where are you, sort of, in your funding you've got a cash balance and then you've got your line of credit. Is your intention to do another bond deal near term? And any, sort of, incremental ATM issuance that you plan for Q4? Sumit Roy : The beauty of our balance sheet today Christy is that we can pretty much access a variety of capital some of which we obviously pre-funded through the ATM in the third quarter. But having a leverage debt-to-EBITDA of 5.0 at the end of the third quarter gives us the ability to certainly access the unsecured market or the equity market given where we trade. So I don't want to share with you precisely what our financing plans are, but -- because we are analyzing it, looking at it on a day-in day-out basis, but it will be a combination of that along with some of the dispositions and the free cash flow from operations that we are going to be generating. Christy McElroy : Okay. Thanks so much for the time. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Shivani Sood : Hey, good afternoon. Just on the disposition side, it looks like you guys have cycled the fair amounts of vacant boxes. So just curious if that was driven by something specific or just trying to take advantage of the very competitive private markets right now. Sumit Roy : Thanks for the question, Shivani. I'm glad you've brought up this thing about vacant assets and why we -- why there was such a preponderance of vacant asset sales. It is not by design that we decided on this particular quarter to have more vacant asset sales. The advantage of being a net lease company is that we are able to look at every asset, freestanding asset and make a determination as to what is the best economic outcome. Holding on to a vacant asset and incurring some of the carrying costs is justifiable, if our belief is that we can get a tenant that is willing to pay rents that justify the carrying costs and the overall return profile is superior to what we are able to get when we sell a vacant asset in the open market. And if that equation sort of does not yield that holding on to an asset is warranted, we go to the market and we sell it at a price and that's precisely what we did this particular quarter. But I wouldn't read one way or the other in terms of whether we are going to do more vacant asset sales going forward versus not. This is a decision that our asset management team is involved in on a day-in day-out basis, where they are constantly determining what is the right strategy for a given asset. And it just so happens that in this particular quarter we had quite a few vacant asset sales. Shivani Sood : Thanks for the color. It's really helpful. And then just wondering, if you can give us an update on your thoughts on just development as a component of the overall investment pipeline just given the higher relative yields, excuse me. Should we expect that -- to see that continue to increase if we stay in a lower for longer interest rate environment? Sumit Roy : Shivani, that's a very good question. Once again, our development program has been anywhere between call it $35 million $36 million, which it is today, to as high as $150 million. And that continues to be an area that we are focused on. To the point that you've made regarding higher yield that is part of what the asset management team does. When we get an asset back, we are constantly thinking about -- one of the options that we explore is to see whether we can reposition those particular assets. And in some cases the answer is yes and that is the vast majority of the developments that we are currently involved in. And yes, it does give us a much higher yield and allows us to continue to expand our tenant relationships. And in fact, that's how we were able to get Starbucks as one of our tenants. So that is a program that we like. It's a small program today but it's one that we will continue to build on going forward. Shivani Sood : Thanks for the time. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open. Rob Stevenson : Good afternoon, guys. So are you guys looking at any non-U.K., European acquisitions these days? And how is your staffing over there going? And sort of what your sort of funnel look like outside of the U.S. these days? Sumit Roy : So thanks for the question, Rob. Most of what we are looking at currently is all in the U.K. Yes we have sourced in the -- sourcing number that we shared with you the $6 billion. Some of it was in mainland Europe, but it was primarily driven by sourcing in the U.K. We are continuing to focus on stabilizing and creating a flow business that we can lean on in the U.K. That is our priority one. But that's not to say that for the right opportunity, we wouldn't consider moving to Western Europe. But that is not the focus currently. With regards to the team and setting up an office et cetera, we are very close to making that happen. I think I've mentioned this in one of my previous calls we have one of our veteran acquisition officers moving to the U.K. potentially later this month but certainly by December. And we are also in the midst of supplementing that team with somebody from the local markets that we are very excited about. And that will be the seeding of that particular office going forward. And I think I've mentioned this as well that some of the support functions have been outsourced. And over time when we have built a portfolio that can justify bringing in some of these outsourced support functions we will then grow the team to accommodate that as well. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then Paul what's keeping you from an A rating at Fitch? I mean, you've been A at Moody's for a while and even S&P upgraded you more than a year ago now. What are they telling you the sort of reason why you're still sort of -- if the word can be termed languishing BBB+? Paul Meurer : I'm smiling a bit Rob. We agree with your analysis. We think we're well deserving of an upgrade there and certainly have shared with them significant data to show that on a comparable basis versus other A-rated REITs out there, et cetera that our metrics not only support that, but also demonstrates stability through different economic cycles, et cetera. So we also are a bit perplexed as to where we stand. They do their homework and give a review, but just haven't been ready to kind of move it up to the next level. And we think that it would be appropriate for them to continue that review and hopefully reach that more positive conclusion soon. Rob Stevenson : Would the upgrade there have any practical impact on you guys? Or is it more of at this point just a marketing positive? Paul Meurer : Our understanding is at this moment in the market, no. It really doesn't inhibit us in any way at this point nor would it make a market difference to have that additional rating with them. Rob Stevenson : Okay. Thanks guys. Paul Meurer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is open. Linda Tsai : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. When you look at the investment spreads for domestic and international transactions would you expect these ranges to largely hold in the upcoming quarters? I mean, I realize it has likely to do with the mix of what you're buying, but what are some inputs to consider in terms of potential movements? Sumit Roy : Well, there are two things that you obviously need to focus on in order to determine what the spread is. One is the cap rates. And as you've pointed out and I think I've said in my prepared remarks that the cap rates for the assets that we are interested in the U.K. tend to be in the high 4s to the mid 5% range. And then the question becomes, okay, how do we go about financing that particular acquisition. And that's where our cost of capital advantages really come to the 4%. Our weighted average nominal cost of capital in the U.K. today is right around the 2.8%. And so even a 4.7% is a very healthy 190 basis points of spread. And clearly on the U.S. side, our cost of capital is higher. It's closer to 3.7% today 3.8%. And -- but we are able to then buy assets at a higher blended cap rate. And so the spreads are being quite advantageous there as well. So once you sort of take into account where the cap rates are in the cost of capital, I think the spreads will -- it just so happens that this particular quarter, it's being essentially the same. I think it was 10% less spread in the U.K. or -- versus what we had in the U.S. But that I wouldn't say is the norm going forward. There are quarters -- it's quite possible that in the U.K. we may be able to do even better. But if you have to think about a trend line, I wouldn't forecast one geography necessarily having a superior spread to the other. Linda Tsai : Thanks for that. And then given you've deleveraged to about five times in 3Q, would this be a reasonable expectation to maintain going forward? Sumit Roy : I think what we have publicly said and what we have shared with the rating agencies is that we want the flexibility to run our business at a 5.5 times plus minus. And that's the right ZIP Code for us. The fact that it is five today is largely being driven by the over funding that we spoke about given the pipeline that we have visibility into. So I wouldn't necessarily say that five is the new norm. I would just say that it will fluctuate, but 5.5 is where you should expect us to operate in the balance sheet. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi thanks. Just looking at Walgreens the stock is reacting well today just on speculation that it's in talks to go private. And not that I'm asking you to comment on this but maybe just a couple questions around your Walgreens exposure just as a reminder these individual leases any master leases. That's part one. And then part two when you look at a public tenant maybe in your past going private, how do you kind of look at that risk and maybe just some context around that? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Sure Todd. It's a very good question. Yes, we have seen the rumors as well real-time or breaking news if that is truly accurate. And look in the past when we have seen smaller operators go private, cash flowing businesses that go private, and especially, if it's going private using the private equity route, that has tended to change the leverage profile of the business. The good news here is you're talking about a company that is approximately $70 billion in enterprise value with an equity market cap of about $55 billion, $60 billion if I remember correctly. So, the reasons for it to go private if that is true would need to be a lot more strategic. And -- so we feel pretty good. Look we've said that the entire delivery of healthcare is an area that is going through massive changes. But what we are very excited about is the fact that we own the brick-and-mortar. And any solution -- and that's our thesis and our belief is that any solution which is going to lead to more efficiency in the delivery of health care is going to require a brick-and-mortar network. And so -- and I don't want to start speculating as to who the potential buyers if there's any truth to that, but I think whatever happens, there's going to be some story around that as -- like why is it that as a private company or as a combined company with somebody else, et cetera the value proposition is even better? If that's not the case, I don't think that there would be rumors about it going private. So, we would still be very comfortable. With regards to whether we have master leases, we don't. But I just want to remind you that most of the Walgreens that we have in our portfolio came through sale-leaseback directly with Walgreens. And so these are institutional quality leases with growth et cetera and I think our weighted average lease term on the Walgreens is right around 10 years. So, we are very comfortable regardless of which direction this news ends up going. Todd Stender : Okay. Thanks for that. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open. John Massocca : Good afternoon. Sumit Roy : Hi John. Sumit Roy : So, with regards to the CMFT transaction, is any portion of that portfolio potentially not a good long-term fit within your portfolio? And if so, how might that impact 2020 disposition activity? Understanding you're probably not going to give 2020 guidance, but just any commentary there would be helpful. Sumit Roy : Sure. And so I think when we first announced this particular transaction, we spoke about -- this is a $1.25 billion transaction. We expect the vast majority of it to close later this year. And we also said that about $200 million of this particular portfolio are assets that we wouldn't have pursued in the one-off market. And so -- but that does not necessarily mean that all of the $200 million that we have acquired are going to be disposed of day one. In some cases, the economic argument would be that we hold on to the assets, collect the rents for the duration of the remaining lease term, and then given the location, given the below-market rents, whatever the dynamics are that it might actually be better for us to hold on to it and try to re-tenant it. Or it could also imply holding on to the assets until the end of their initial lease term and then selling it. So, -- and then there's a small bucket of that $200 million that we are absolutely going to come out with in 2020. And when we come out with our guidance in February, we will share that information with you. John Massocca : Okay. That makes sense. And then, looking kind of at the existing debt stack, you've seen some of your peers kind of prepay some higher coupon debt. I mean does that make sense potentially for you guys going forward? Paul Meurer : It very well could. We did a fair amount of that refinancing activity over the past 24 months, if you will. And some of that we already kind of took care of. But it is fair to say that they're still a little bit there that we're taking a look at. And as we get closer, obviously, it becomes cheaper to do so. And it is something that we're taking a look at. John Massocca : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Your line is open. Collin Mings : Hey, good afternoon. Paul Meurer : Hi. Collin. How are you? Collin Mings : Doing well, doing well. I just want to pick up a bit on John's question, just as it relates to the CIM deal and maybe more broadly your ability to execute on larger portfolio deals. Can you maybe just update us on if you believe there's a portfolio discount available in the market right now, and just maybe talk a little bit more about that opportunity? Sumit Roy : Yeah. Look, I think variants of this question have been asked in previous calls. And at least over the last couple of years, I would say, that we believe that there has been a decided discount when we pursue portfolio transactions. And we've seen this in the sale leaseback market. We've seen this even in the U.K. When we are able to come in and write big checks $0.5 billion, $1 billion, et cetera, we do get some form of discounts. And so, I don't want to speak specifically to the CIM portfolio. But largely speaking, we have seen portfolio discounts. And those portfolio discounts could range anywhere between 25 to 75 to even 100 basis points, if you compare it to the one-off 1,031 market. And that is one of the advantages of having size and scale. Collin Mings : And I guess to that point to your comments that you've highlighted and talked about this dynamic before, do you feel like that gap is widening or narrowing? Or can you speak to that at all? Or does it just really vary deal to deal as you look across the marketplace? Sumit Roy : I think it's the latter, Collin. I can't tell you that on every portfolio you have x basis points of discounts, and that remains constant regardless of the tenant regardless of the market environment. What I can tell you is we do see a discount, but the amount of the discount will certainly vary. And we've seen that on multiple sale leasebacks that we've done with the same tenant, in fact, where given market conditions, they're willing to accommodate us given our movements and cost of capital. And then, when things improve we accommodate them. So, it's not one fixed number, but it is a discount. Collin Mings : Okay. And then, just one last one for me. Just more directly, can you maybe touch on the drop quarter-over-quarter in the Circle K exposure? Sumit Roy : That probably has to do with rollovers. I think we've had a couple of Circle K rollovers, one of which we got back. And there was another one where we actually entered into a very long-term lease, and we invested the capital to expand the space, because they want to expand their convenience store. So, it really is a function of just what is precisely happening. I don't really know what the movement was, but I do remember seeing a couple of these and the investment committee. And so, in certain cases we've invested more and in others we've got back vacant assets. Collin Mings : Got it. Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Sure, Collin. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for closing remarks. Sumit Roy : So thank you all for joining us today, and we're looking forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Crum, Associate Director, Realty Income. Please go ahead. Andrew Crum : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter and year end 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer. During this conference, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Andrew. Welcome everyone. We completed another year of strong operating performance delivering favorable risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. We are pleased to have provided our shareholders with more than 21.2% total shareholder return in 2019. During the year, we invested over $3.7 billion in real estate properties, an increase to AFFO per share by 4.1% to $3.32 per share. 2019 was a record year for property level acquisitions, and included approximately $798 million in international investments, including our first ever international sale leaseback of 12 properties located in the United Kingdom leased to Sainsbury's, a leading grocer. In 2019, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our Company's founding and the 25th year since our public listing, and we were proud to be added to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index earlier this month. But being an S&P 500 constituent that has raised its dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We entered 2020 very well positioned across all areas of the business and are introducing 2020 AFFO per share guidance of $3.50 to $3.56, which represents annual growth rate of approximately 5.4% to 7.2%. Earlier this month, we announced that Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer is leaving the company. To ensure a smooth transition, Paul will serve as a Senior Advisor to the company through the end of the first quarter and the company has begun a search for a new Chief Financial Officer. I want to thank Paul for his valued partnership and tremendous contributions to the company over the many years. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to 301 commercial tenants in 50 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. 83% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.1% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.6% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 96% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of the recent US retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio, with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties, it's 2.8 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.9% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior quarter. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2020. During the quarter we released 28 properties recapturing 106% of the expiring rent. During 2019 we released 214 properties recapturing 103% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 3,100 properties with leases expiring recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 1.6% during 2019, which is above our full year projection of approximately 1%, primarily due to the recognition of percentage rent. We expect same-store rent growth to normalize in 2020 and our projected run rate for 2020 is approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases. Moving on, I will provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 4.3% for the quarter and 4.7% for the year, which was consistent with our full year projection of below 5%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to be approximately 5% in 2020. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue was 1.4% for both the quarter and for the year, which was lower than our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range. Briefly, turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least AA ratings. During the fourth quarter, we raised $582 million of common equity primarily through our ATM program at approximately $75.52 per share. For the full year, we raised $2.2 billion of equity at approximately $72.40 per share, finishing the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 5 times, which is the highest coverage ratio we have reported for any quarter in our company's history. In January, we completed the early repayment of our $250 million 5.75%, 2021 bond through a full par call. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape as the weighted average maturity of our bonds is 8.3 years, and we have only $334 million of debt coming due in 2020, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics, ample liquidity and excellent access to well priced capital. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we invested approximately $1.7 billion in 556 properties located in 42 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.2 years. Approximately $1.2 billion of this quarters acquisitions were related to the CIM portfolio acquisition we announced in September. On a total revenue basis approximately 47% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment grade rated tenants. 100% of the revenues were generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 78 different tenants in 26 industries last year. Some of the more significant industries represented are convenience stores, dollar stores and drug stores. We closed 12 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and approximately 10% of fourth quarter investment volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Off the $1.7 billion invested during the quarter, $1.5 billion was invested domestically in 551 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.6 years. During the quarter, $221 million was invested internationally in five properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.1 years. During 2019, we invested over $3.7 billion in 789 properties located in 45 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years. On a revenue basis, 36% of total acquisitions are from investment grade rated tenants, 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 112 different tenants in 31 industries. Of the 72 independent transactions closed in 2019, 11 transactions were above $50 million. Approximately 38% of 2019 investment volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $3.7 billion invested in 2019, nearly $2.9 billion was invested domestically in 771 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 13 years. During 2019, approximately $798 million were invested internationally in 18 properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.6 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $11.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Of the $11.7 billion sourced during the quarter, $9.8 billion were domestic opportunities and $1.9 billion were international opportunities. Investment grade opportunities represented 17% of the volume sourced for the fourth quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the fourth quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $5 billion were one-off assets. In 2019 we sourced approximately $57 billion in potential transaction opportunities which marks the highest annual volume sourced in our company's history. Of this $57 billion sourced in 2019, 42% were portfolios and 58% or approximately $33 billion were one-off assets. Of these opportunities, $45 billion were domestic opportunities and $12 billion were international opportunities. Of the $1.7 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter 15% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, US investment grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the type of assets we are targeting, investment grade or implied investment grade properties are trading from the low 4% to high 5% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from the 5% to the low 7% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 325 basis points for domestic investments and 228 basis points for international investments, both of which were well above our historical average spreads. Our investment spreads for 2019 averaged 271 basis points for all of our investment activity, representing the widest annual spreads in our company's history. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less a nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline, both domestic and international remains robust, and we believe we are the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale, and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Based on the continued strength in our investment pipeline, as well as our excellent access to well priced capital, we are introducing 2020 acquisition guidance of $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion. Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 29 properties for net proceeds of $36.3 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.8% and we realized an unlevered IRR of 10.4%. This brings us to 92 properties sold in 2019 for $108 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that benefit our investment parameters. We are expecting between $200 million and $225 million of dispositions in 2020, a large portion of which already closed earlier this month. In January, we increased the dividend for the 105th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 79% based on the midpoint of 2020 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.6%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, it was a successful and active year for us in 2019, and we look to continue the momentum in 2020. Our portfolio is performing well. Our global investment pipeline is robust and our cost of capital and ample liquidity positions us to capitalize on our growth initiatives. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Greg McGinniss : Hey, this is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Digging into the acquisition guidance a bit. We're curious if you could give us estimated split between the US and UK, whether the EU's an option for 2020 and what cap rate are investment spread is assumed in the underwriting? Thanks. Sumit Roy : The make up is going to be approximately 20% international, 80% domestic. And the spreads are going to be -- our hope is well north of our average spreads of 150 basis points, 160 basis points. Greg McGinniss : Okay. So coming in a bit from what you guys accomplished and I'm assuming that's just more conservatism than anything else? Sumit Roy : That's what we feel very comfortable sharing with the market. Obviously what happened last year is something that we expect to continue, but we feel very confident in being able to say that our range in the acquisition is going to be in the $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion. And we hope to do far better than our average spreads, which as I said was right around 150 basis points to 160 basis points. So yes, a certain level of conservatism. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And then, so we know the acquisition guidance does not include potential portfolio acquisitions, but could you give us maybe some sense for what you're seeing out in the market today on that front. Are there portfolios currently being marketed to you, when you looking at any right now one that size. I'm just trying to get a sense what are reasonable upside as to acquisition guidance? Sumit Roy : Yes. So let's be a little bit clear on what we are defining as portfolios. The large portfolio transaction that we did last year was at $1.1 billion CIM transaction, $1.2 billion CIM transaction. That's the kind of transaction that hasn't been sort of built into our $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion number. Clearly we are in the market and are constantly doing portfolio sizes in the range of $100 million to $200 million, and those are very much part and parcel of what's included in our guidance. Look, we've shared with you what the sourcing numbers were for 2019. We haven't seen any let up in terms of what we are seeing. So far and so early in the year, we are very optimistic about the pipeline and we are very optimistic of meeting the guidelines that we have shared with the market. And at this point, there is nothing that we are seeing in the horizon that would lead us to believe that this is going to be a much slower year than what we saw last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy : Hey, good morning Sumit. Thank you. Just with a pickup in some of the open-air retailers filing for bankruptcy and announcing closures in recent months, and also reports of others hiring restructuring advisors. Can you talk about any specific tenants that you have exposure to that fall into this category or any pocket of your exposure where you're concerned about fallout, if you look into the next year. Sumit Roy : There are some tenants that we are obviously looking at very closely. The good news here is we are so well diversified Christy that these are tenants that have very minimal, well below 1% exposure to. For instance, PO1 is one of our tenants that we are looking at, it's been on our credit watch list for a while. We have 12 assets with them, it's right around 10 basis points of rent. We did a sale leaseback with them in 1998 and it's actually been a great transaction for us. So we are almost indifferent as to what happens with them on 9 of the 12 properties we already getting inbound calls from large national tenants, that gives us very high level of confidence that we would be able to reposition this asset. A couple of other names that we are keeping a close eye on Crystal's is another one that we acquired through a large portfolio again basis points of rent and based on the four-wall coverage we feel our portfolio is very well positioned. And once again, but that's a corporate level credit that is in the news and one that we are looking at very closely. But in aggregate, we have obviously taken all of this into account in forecasting out our AFFO per share guidance. And so you can tell from the guidance that we have laid out Christy that fingers crossed this year will again be a very, very good year for us. Christy McElroy : And you talked about in your opening remarks, the spreads in market cap rates between investment grade and non-investment grade. Do you think those spreads are wide enough just given sort of that tenant followed environment where you're seeing, and I think I heard you say that about -- said that about 70% of the deals that you're sourcing are investment grade versus, I think it's 50% in place. So will there be a continued effort to sort of raise investment grade exposure? Sumit Roy : Actually what we are seeing is something very interesting Christy. I would argue that some of the higher yielding assets have compressed with regards to cap rates, and are moving closer to investment grade cap rates are in the market. So it hasn't been a movement in the investment grade market that is as pronounced as it is in the higher yielding markets. So, one must take into consideration, on a risk adjusted basis, where are you better off investing. And I think we've shared this with you in the past, Christy, credit is very much part of the analysis that we undertake. But we are not pursuing a particular credit profile. We are looking at it in totality and trying to come up with for the risk that one is assuming are the returns appropriate. That's how we look at all of our investments. And -- but the point I want to make is high yielding assets that used to have a high 7%, even an 8% cap rate now trading at a 6% cap rate and investment grade assets that were potentially in the high 5s are in the low 5s. So it's a far more pronounced compression that we are seeing in the higher yielding side of the equation, and it does give us pause, when we look at it from a risk adjusted basis as to whether we should continue to pursue all of those transactions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Shivani Sood : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. As following up on these earlier question about portfolios, curious if you're seeing increased competition for larger portfolio acquisitions or sale leasebacks from private players in recent months. And how has that changed, how you're sourcing and approaching the process to remain ahead of that? Sumit Roy : Shivani for us it's business as usual. We are not changing any of our methods of sourcing or pursuing potential transactions that have a risk profile that is not justified by the cap rates, that's being ascribed or that's being asked. I mean, we have, we did 89% of our transactions in 2019 were relationship driven transactions. We are continuing to pursue those. We continue to reach out to clients of ours that have credit that we feel very comfortable with. These are assets that don't even get marketed, and we continue to build on the sale leaseback side of the equation. And absent CIM, 61% of what we did last year was sale leaseback. So I wouldn't say that in any way we have altered the way that we are pursuing acquisitions. What we have done on the international side of the equation is, obviously, we have continued to establish new relationships with again having done the homework around clients that we would like to pursue over the long-term. And that has to been a major push for Neil and for myself to continue to grow our international platform. And thankfully, we've made a fair amount of progress on that front. Shivani Sood : Thanks for that color. Just switching topics, the recap rate for occupied boxes is really good in the quarter. Can you share some more color on what drove that? Sumit Roy : Yes, sure. So there were basically two things that drove that. And then as you can see our 2020 guidance is right around 1% which is traditionally being what we have said. Not every lease that we have has an annual rent growth. Some have rent growth every three years, some have rent growth every five years, and it just so happened that a disproportionate number of leases had growth coming in 2019. For instance, if you look at the Dollar stores, 46% of all the assets that we own within that bucket had an increase in 2019, and most of those were either a three or a five year rental increase, and that accounted for about 34% of the disproportionate increase in the rent, the 1.6% that we were able to achieve. On the second note a smaller contribution to the increase was the timing of the percentage rent accruals and that too helped. But if you were to take those two out of the equation, we would be right around what we have guided the market to for 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open. Rob Stevenson : Good afternoon. How are you feeling these days about the office segment. I mean you've added one asset in the last year. Is that a source of dispositions going forward? Is that a source of acquisitions going forward? I mean what's the -- how do you think about that over the next three years? Sumit Roy : Rob, so as far as I know, our exposure to office has continued to dwindle over the last few years. It used to be north of 6% at one stage, today it's in the 3% zip code. And it's a product type that we have accumulated largely through large portfolio transactions. We haven't proactively gone out and bought some single-tenant net leased office asset. Having said that, the commentary I'm sharing with you is very much a US based commentary, but I suspect that it is going to be very similar even in the international market. So our view regarding office has not changed. It's asset type that we are very cautious about and we tend to be very, very selective when we even take a particular opportunity and do a deep dive into underwriting the opportunities. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then I guess the other question for me winds up being when you take a look at the balance sheet over the next couple of years, a lot of sort of heavy lifting has been done. I mean, where -- is there any sort of opportunities out there for you guys to pick up anything over the next couple of years with rates bottoming yet again? Sumit Roy : To me that is such a tertiary mechanism or tool to utilize to help grow our earnings. And I'm glad that you observe that by and large, our efficiency around our balance sheet financing has largely been realized. There is another unsecured that has a high 4% coupon, I believe in 2023, but that's one that we -- depending on where the interest rate environment is, we might take a look at taking out, but that is such a tertiary consideration when I think about what are the drivers of AFFO per share growth. But yes, I'm very happy. Jonathan, are there any other points you would like to make? Jonathan Pong : Yes, Rob, I think when you look out over the next few years through 2023, we obviously ticked down the 2021 in January, but in '23 and '24, we do have $1.7 million of debt that's maturing, but 2022 early in the quarter, but 2023 our [indiscernible] and so knock on wood rates stay low. It's interesting that a 3.25% coupon today is fairly high. So what we are looking at liability management ideas we're always thinking about how the make whole math kind of translates into a breakeven rate, if we were to refinance certain piece of the capital stack and you can expect us to continue doing that on a go-forward basis. Rob Stevenson : And just preferred have any place in the capital stack going forward? Sumit Roy : We could issue in the mid to high 4s today on the preferred side. It's always something that we'll look at. But when you look at the indicative cost for us of 30-year unsecured paper, that's in the low 3% range today. That gap doesn't make a lot of sense for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open. Brian Hawthorne : Hi. How comfortable are you with your C-store exposure and how high would you be OK with it going? Sumit Roy : We are very comfortable with the kind of tenants that we have exposure to that largely constitute our industry exposure. 7-Eleven, Couche-Tard, under the Circle K banner, those are names that we are very comfortable with. They are the best-in-class convenience store operators and we monitor their business. We have a very close relationship with them. And we are very comfortable there. What we are not comfortable with are, the smaller format kiosk type C-stores that heavily rely on fuel sale to drive profitability. And thankfully those are largely out of our portfolio. We do have some, but by and large, most of that 11% exposure is being driven by 7-Eleven and Circle K. Brian Hawthorne : Okay. And then have your tenants talked about rising wages impacting their coverages at all? The coverage ratios? Sumit Roy : We went through how many, it was like north of 200 leases, and the fact that I'm sure those conversations in every -- not there in every tenant conversations, but I'm sure in some cases, those conversations had to have alluded to higher labor costs. But by and large, we are happy to report that our tenants are doing fairly well, and the fact that we were able to recapture 103% net of expiring rents leads one to believe that at least the kinds of tenants that we have exposure to are not insulated but are able to absorb the higher labor costs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisor. Please go ahead, your line is open. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. In terms of the $12 billion of deals you guys sourced international this year, can you provide a little color on what particular property types or industries you are seeing most heavily marketed abroad? Sumit Roy : It's largely grocers, it's C-stores, it's movie theaters, it's discount retail, those are the buckets that they would fall in, as well as some industrial. Spenser Allaway : Okay and then just going back to the previous question on the recent wave of bankruptcies and ongoing headwinds in the retail segment. Do you suspect that we could see capex eventually creep higher in the net lease segment just in terms of TIs or potential deferred caped on any vacant assets? Sumit Roy : We saw the exact opposite. Our capex has largely been consistent over the last three years. And what has actually reduced was our property expenses. If you notice, we were forecasting to the market that it would be anywhere between 1.5% to 1.75%, and we ended up being at 1.4%. And the reason -- there were two reasons for that. One was that the property taxes that we were forecasting on our vacant assets was far more than what we actually realized, given that we were able to sell our vacant assets at very attractive or total returns. And obviously the top line grew well in advance of what we had forecasted. So those two factors resulted in the property expense margins coming in below 1.5%. We are not seeing our capex numbers changing based on the current climate. And I think it's largely due to the type of retail that we invest in. Its net lease, if it's working for the tenant, they are happy to invest the capex themselves, reposition the assets to continue to remain relevant and drive profitability out of the store. And that's why the net lease industry tends to be a very, very efficient industry. But again, it is absolutely a function of the clients that one chooses to create an exposure to. And if it's the wrong set of clients, I'd say Spencer that that could have a different effect, but on our portfolio we are not seeing it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Todd Stender : Thanks. Looking at the average lease term, it's now just over nine years. It's been hedging lower and you guys have certainly acknowledged that. Can you talk about the recent releasing activity. Maybe in the term that they're renewed for. Your acquisitions have on average been higher than that average, but the portfolio average keeps drifting lower. Maybe just talk about releasing if you don't mind? Sumit Roy : Yes, sure. And this is something we've talked about in the past as well Todd. If you think about it, at least -- lease the original lease tends to have a 15 year, 20 year or even 25 year sale leaseback. And then you have options built into these leases and those options tend to be five-year options. And this is all disclosed in our supplemental. If you look at our history of releasing and we've done north of 3,000 leases. 88% and it's been higher more recently. 80% to 90% of the existing tenants exercise these options. And so when you reset the lease term, it's right around the five year timeframe. It's only when we are going out and retenanting it with a new tenant or finding a new tenant even with zero vacancies that we have the opportunity to go beyond the five to something like a 10, and those have average in the six to seven years zip code. And so if we were to do no acquisitions, I think the normalized run rate for a net lease company, a very, very mature net lease company which is doing zero acquisitions or very little as a percentage of their overall portfolio. The normalized weighted average lease term is going to be right around six to seven years. And that's where the asset management and real estate operations team comes into play. And we have anticipated this and set the team up accordingly. And I think the results speak for themselves. On a quarterly basis, we share with you what the releasing spread is, and we share with you what's the capital invested was -- with regards to tenant incentives etc, and more often than not they tend to be zero. And we've been capturing north of 100% of the expiring rents. 103% this year. It was similar number last year and in this last quarter was 106%. So I believe that we have a team that in fact could be viewed as somebody that could create value, when these leases start to roll and we are able to maintain the kind of releasing activity that we have, being able to achieve over the last three to four years, that could become a growth driver for us. But clearly, new acquisitions, one should expect if it's a sale leaseback, it should be in that 15 to 20 years zip code and if it's acquired lease, it's going to have double-digit numbers. But as we become a bigger company and unless our acquisition numbers don't keep up on a pro rata basis, the weighted average lease term is going to continue to sort of get lower and should normalize right around seven years. Todd Stender : To that extension option number. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you, Sumit. Sumit Roy : Sure. Of course. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open. John Massocca : Good afternoon. So you mentioned -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks there was significant -- if I heard you correctly, that significant portion of expected 2020 disposition activity closed earlier this month. Can you provide some color on what drove that? Sumit Roy : Sure. We are under an NDA, so I have to be very careful. But it was one of our clients who did a strategic review of their real estate operations and approached us to buy back some of the assets that they had leased to us or vice versa that we had leased to them. And it was a very attractive return. We had five years left on the portfolio. And we were able to transact with them and that closed, I believe, early part of last week, and it was to the tune of about $116 million. So if you subtract out the $116 million in dispositions, you're back up to a right around $108 million and that's around the levels of what we achieved in 2019. John Massocca : Okay that makes sense. Then as we kind of think about dispositions outside of that transaction. How much I guess is potentially being driven by the CIM portfolio and maybe kind of fine-tuning that portfolio more to kind of what you guys want to hold long-term? Sumit Roy : Yes. This is the question that we've answered before, when we had announced the CIM transaction. This was a $1.2 billion transaction. We had said that $1 billion worth of the assets that we purchased were ones that we would buy in the open market, if they were available one-off. There's about $200 million worth of assets that we are going to asset manage more aggressively, and by that we had also bucketed that $200 million into some of them are going to be made available for immediate marketing and that's about 25% call it plus, minus. And the rest we would collect the rent for as long as the tenants continues to pay rent. And because of the location, because of the rent per square feet, we feel very good about being able to reposition those assets with potentially new tenants. And so that was the way that we underwrote the $200 million worth that would require more attention, if you will. And that hasn't changed. That's precisely the way we are thinking about the CIM portfolio. John Massocca : Okay. But then when you think about dispositions on kind of a net basis with that, let's say $50 million that maybe a little more immediately ready for repositioning within the CIM portfolio. It would seem to imply then I guess maybe less disposition activity versus what you guys accomplished this year or is that the wrong way of thinking about it and all this will be kind of blended together? Sumit Roy : Yes. Because, are you guaranteeing me that you are going to be able to -- we'll be able to sell those $50 million this year in 2020? We don't -- we didn't underwrite, thinking that we were going to be able to sell 25% of that portfolio that $200 million portfolio in 2020. So it is certainly a blend John. We would love to be able to achieve that. And if we are, we might come back and say to you later on in the year that our disposition numbers may be north of what we have gone out with. But there is certainly a level of flexibility that we've built into those disposition numbers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Just on, going back to sort of the tenant health issues referenced being really small, several on the restaurant side. There were several names that have cropped up. NBC, Crystal etc. I'm just wondering maybe taking a step back restaurants remain kind of part and parcel of the net lease business. But are you thinking about restaurant slightly differently going forward, maybe on a three, five year basis between public, private, franchisee, direct, corporate-owned, any specific segments. I think any color there would be useful. Just because we've seen a couple of tenant crop up. Sumit Roy : Sure, Vikram. Thanks for your question. We have -- and I am not sharing anything new here. We have been very cautious about the casual dining concept. And more importantly, even if the concept is a good one, we have been very careful about exposing ourselves to small scale franchisees. And so, those factors continue to remain front and center any time we are looking at transactions. And largely what you see playing out in the restaurant space today is not unexpected, and so we are very well -- thankfully, we are very well positioned for the worst outcome in some of what you have just shared in terms of the names and others that we are monitoring. And in fact, our expected outcome on this very small exposure that we have is still going to be north of what we have underwritten in terms of our guidance is my belief. But our thinking has always been very cautious on the casual dining side. It has been more positive on the quick service restaurant side and even within the quick service restaurants there are other drivers such as [indiscernible] need to have a certain number of units, they need to have a certain number of scale that would give us comfort, even if the corporate concept is one that that we find very interesting. So those hurdles have not changed. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. And sorry if I missed this. I dialed in late. But on the international side, I heard you reference a couple of categories you were exploring, but just curious kind of how the pipeline looks between the UK and then broadly Continental Europe? Sumit Roy : Look, our focus is still very much the UK, that's the geography that we decided to go into first for obvious reasons. We feel very comfortable with that. But we are starting to see some very interesting concepts coming out of Western Europe as well. And we are doing our diligence. Niel's making several trips across the pond to explore those opportunities. So I'm not going to keep those off the table, but in terms of the make up, I think you should expect 20% of the volume plus, minus to come from the international market. And I'd love to be surprised and that's a challenge for Neil. But the vast bulk of our acquisitions will still be US domiciled. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Collin Mings from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : First one for me, again this is something that's been discussed on a few prior calls. Obviously a lot of competition out there for industrial assets. Nothing closed during the quarter. Can you maybe just update us on what you're seeing on that front and maybe just talk a little bit about the pipeline on that front going forward? Sumit Roy : Yes. Collin, the way you started asking the question is precise. There is a lot of competition. There are many people chasing single-tenant industrial assets. And yes, we haven't been able to get any over the finish line in the last quarter. We've been close on a few occasions, but did not -- chose not to continue to pursue the aggressiveness on the cap rate side, but it is something, it's a product that we like. It is an exposure to a certain certain types of tenants that we would find as being very complementary to what we already have. It's just that we haven't been able to actively get a lot of transactions over the finish line yet. Collin Mings : Okay. And then, I did want to follow-up, actually now in a couple of questions on the deal flow on the international front. You've referenced a couple of times again targeting plus or minus 20% of your activity in 2020 will fall to your international bucket. So as you think about targeting call it rough numbers $500 million or so of opportunities. Just curious if you can maybe drill down a little bit more. You mentioned a few things in response to Spenser's question in terms of the different sectors or property types you're seeing a lot of the deal flow. Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on where you think you are going to be able to reach the closing table this year on some of those opportunities. And then just, again, as you think about the relationships you've built in the regions to elaborate a little bit more on that as well. Sumit Roy : Yes. It's very difficult to tell precisely where within those different buckets are we going to end up. Let's just look at historically what we have been able to achieve. The large part of the 18 transactions that we -- 18 properties that we acquired, 17 were in the grocer -- were grocery stores and they were the big four grocers in the UK and one happen to be a theater. And so the bulk of the transactions that we are seeing is with the big four. But there are some other transactions that we are starting to see that are very interesting. And I'm not in a position to share with you names of tenants, etc with whom we've -- we are making a lot of progress. That is something, as you can understand for competitive reasons. We'd like to get it over the finish line and then be in a position to talk about it more freely. But our conversations is broader than the grocery industry is what I can share with you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good afternoon. I don't know if I missed it, I don't think I did, but did you mention any update on the search for a new CFO. And if you haven't, could you comment on where that search stand. And what's embedded in the 2020 guidance from both the separation cost and a potential hiring of a new CFO? Sumit Roy : Yes. So look, we have hired a search firm. We have created a profile and we are out in the market looking for the right individual to join the team, that's where we are with regards to the CFO search. The good news is Paul is very much here with us, acting as a Senior Advisor, and will continue to be with us through the end of March. The fact that we have a very strong team with Jonathan Pong and Sean driving our Capital Markets and Finance Departments and Sean driving our Accounting, we feel very comfortable that we don't have to be in a hurry to replace that particular role. We have a very strong team. Our focus is going to be in terms of finding the right person with the right cultural fit and can help be a partner to us in helping drive the next evolution of this company. And we are not going to take an expeditious route to get there. I mean we want to get this right. With regards to your second question or part of your question is around severance, it's just south of $2 million that is going to impact both the G&A as well as our FFO numbers. And yes, I think those were your questions. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you for that. And as a follow-up of sorts, what level of international build-out cost is reflected in the current G&A guide? Remind us again how many people you've committed currently already to your international platform and where you envision that by year-end? Sumit Roy : Yes. So look, we already have a small office in London. We have one person who is driving the business there. We have outsourced a fair amount of the administrative work that is required, i.e., accounting, tax as well as legal, it is quite possible based on the analysis that we have done that in-sourcing some of these functions may make sense. If the growth in our portfolio continues or accelerates the in-sourcing is going to accelerate. So we are very comfortable with the controls that we have in place and the process that we have implemented and it's a structure that allows us to be incredibly flexible. What we have committed to is to higher one other person in the UK, but the number of people who eventually become part of Realty Income Limited will remain to be seen. And it's going to be partially driven by the size of the portfolio that we are able to create. And so having that flexibility, allows us to be much more nimble when it comes to the G&A load that is associated with the platform. Haendel St. Juste: Got it, got it. Thank you for that. And then maybe one more if you entertain me for a second. Curious on -- I guess what your view is on if you feel credit, tenant credits being fairly valued in today's market and whether size is an advantage or maybe a disadvantage for maybe some of your smaller peers have been able to grow faster in an environment where growth seems to have been prioritized over the past year or so. Does that make you any more or less inclined to perhaps consider splitting the company may be into a higher credit and maybe lower credit bucket or perhaps some transaction to in effect make the company a bit smaller or any other strategic change on that front. Sumit Roy : Look that's a whole lot of questions that you have sort of built into this one question. What I can tell you Haendel is, we went through a very deep dive, I'd say now about 16 months ago, 15 months ago, and we feel very comfortable that our size, scale, and cost of capital, first and foremost is very portable and is a massive advantage to us as we have started to show. We can do, very large scale sale leaseback and it does not create immediate tenant concentration issues for us. We can be the one-stop shop for existing tenants and have transactions come to us without it -- without then feeling the need to have to go and test the markets, and that's value to them, it's value to us. It allows us to pursue proprietary software that we are developing in-house, that is going to help us drive the lifecycle of Real Estate within our business. Those are things that comes because we have size and scale. And we believe that we have created enough adjacent verticals and/or are exploring enough verticals, where we will be able to provide a growth rate that is very comparable to all of our net lease peers. And the fact that we have the lower cost of capital, and the fact that we have scale, and the fact that we have size, those are all benefits that should ultimately accrue to us. So until that equation changes, I don't see us having to explore. You know what was it that you said spin-offs or high yielding or lower yielding asset base. I mean this is part of our underwriting and it's in fact, a strength of our underwriting, that allows us to pursue the full spectrum of credit tenants and opportunities and it's what helps us drive growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Sumit forget about a spin, but just thinking about disposition volumes, right, because on one hand, it would be highly dilutive relative to buying something with your cost of capital, being able to sell obviously on asset at much higher cap rate than where you're effectively funding your costs. So recognizing that there is some dilutive aspect to selling assets. I would have thought just given your comments about how the markets pricing non-investment grade, given your size and scale of your portfolio that you would be able to look for either industry tenant or geographical potential concerns where you may want to take a more aggressive approach at shrinking the base, so that the ad of things that you're doing all these verticals that you're in, and having international and having your cost of capital from the debt and equity perspective, provides that much more bottom line growth over time and so that you're not going to be faced with something that comes down the road 12 to 24 months. I would just imagine out of your portfolio there has got to be more than $50 million or $75 million of dispositions, I think you'd want to do, if you really took a hard look at the portfolio? Sumit Roy : And we are constantly doing that, Michael. We are constantly looking at the portfolio. We are trying to figure out what is the best economic outcome. Despite the fact that the cap rates seem very aggressive, what do we feel we can sell a given asset at versus holding on to that asset, collecting the lease and selling it vacant at the end. That's an analysis that we are constantly doing. The advantage that we have is so many of our assets and I talked about the PO1 example, we did a sale leaseback on those 12 assets that we own in 1998. We can sell those assets for ground and come out with higher single digit unlevered IRRs. But the fact is their rent is current. We are going to collect the rent and when they -- if they decide that they want to hand over some of the assets back to us at that point, we could do the exact same thing that we can do it today, but we have a few more months of rent collected. So it really comes down to an economic argument. And I think what differentiates us is we are constantly doing that on the assets that we have identified as not long-term holds. And in some situations, we have decided the selling it today is absolutely the right economic outcome because the rent we're collecting perhaps is not enough to justify holding it till the rent starts coming in. And that's where that $100 million and in this year $200 million of disposition number comes in. I think if you add up everything we've done over the last six years, it's north of a $1 billion of assets that we have sold. And it's not to avoid the dilution. You're absolutely right. That is a third level, fourth level consideration, but it's not the driver of the decision making process. It is really the economic analysis that we undertake Michael. Michael Bilerman : Your company is two times just over the last five years and you go last 10 years it's 4 times, right. Just in terms of size of the asset base. I guess, and I know the benefits of size and scale in terms of your cost of capital helping driving additional growth and allows you to do things as you said without getting a tenant concentration issue. For others, they may not want to take off as much of a portfolio been certain vertical because of that. I just, I guess I'm surprised that there isn't -- and look maybe all the investments you've made have been great, and you don't have a lot of issues, I guess I'm just surprised that there isn't that more aggressiveness of recycling of portfolio, especially in this environment where credit is being I think mispriced? Sumit Roy : Yes. Look, we continue to keep looking at it Michael. And who knows, maybe in a few years we'll come out and or not even a few years, maybe in 12 months will come out and say we may need to do more. But right now we feel fairly comfortable that I think we've -- based on the analysis that we've done. We are comfortable with the $200 million of dispositions. Michael Bilerman : Have your views changed on public to public M&A within the net lease space, and sort of where is your mindset today, especially given your comments about size and scale and being bigger and being able to inherit other problems and dispose or they're not as big of a problem for you as they are of the target? Sumit Roy : We've always been open to M&A, Michael. It's -- the question that we have wrestled with and the reason why we haven't been able to move forward has always been, do we have a seller out there that's willing to essentially sell their -- sell themselves. And if that situation were to occur, we would absolutely engage in a conversation. The question is, you look around the net lease space today and you see all of the net lease companies are trading at very high multiples. All of them seem to have a process identified to continue to grow their business. Within that environment, do you see someone raising their hand and saying, look, we would like to engage. If that happens, we are not going to shy away from engaging in that conversation and pursuing M&A. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming conference. Thank you, Kenzie. Operator : Thank you, this concludes today's conference call, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Glenn will then wrap up with closing remarks. We will conclude today's call by opening the line for questions, where we will be joined by our Chief Investment Officer, Tom Roberts. Glenn, let me turn the call over to you. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks Bonni. And thanks for joining us today. The world has changed and while we know that normal first quarter results will not be at the forefront of this call, there are a few quick highlights. AFFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.17. Year-to-date acquisitions totaled $146 million. In addition, the office partnership acquired a $33 million property of which the company cash contribution was $2.7 million. Dispositions totaled $188 million including the Company\u2019s share of dispositions contributed to the office partnership of $70.2 million. As the impact of Covid-19 grew in March, we paused balance sheet acquisitions to better understand the current environment. Net debt to normalize EBITDA was unchanged from last quarter at 5.7x. What have we been thinking about since the quarter end? We are certainly happy that our team together since 2015 executed a number of strategies and transactions as a prerequisite to begin growth in 2020. We believed it was prudent to sell the nontraded REIT business, Cole Capital, greatly reduced the concentration in our largest tenant and generally diversify the portfolio. Settle all outstanding litigation and obtain an investment grade rating balance sheet. Our business model diversifies our capital sources to include institutional partnerships, picking assets which pose no conflict. However, here we are in a disrupted economy. And we now have four overriding goals. Keep our employees safe and provide a work environment and tools to be productive. Recognize the extent of challenges and interact in a collaborative fashion. Maintain the progress we work so hard for especially the resulting investment grade balance sheets and use the business model we built to grow AFFO when the market stabilizes. We understand there are a number of portfolio factors you are interested in and I will let our Chief Operating Officer, Paul McDowell, who has been working closely with our tenants, bring you up to date. Paul? Paul McDowell : Thanks Glenn. As already mentioned, we know the focal point for this call is how the portfolio is performing during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our teams are still very focused on normal asset management which is also very important. Leasing for the quarter was very strong with over 2 million square feet leased of which 1.4 million square feet were early renewals. Total activity included 1.3 million square feet of industrial, 498,000 square feet of office; a 190,000 square feet of retail and 73,000 square feet of restaurants. For renewal leases, we recaptured approximately 94% of prior rents on an initial cash basis. And many of these newly extended leases have additional built in rent increases. Importantly, we were able to finalize leases we had in process prior to the pandemic disruption along with some dispositions and some of that activity has carried further into Q2. Occupancy ended the quarter at a healthy 99.1%. Now let's talk more specifically about our portfolio performance and where we are today. Our April rent receipt came in at 81% and so far rent for May is at 78% which includes 2% to be paid from a government agency tenant that pays in arrears. The underpinnings of these relatively strong collection results were driven by our property type diversification, industry breakdown, investment grade tenancy; public versus private ownership and geographic diversity. Our allocation to office, industrial and necessity based retail including our top industry exposures such as discount, pharmacy, grocery warehouse clubs and convenience has helped in our rental collection. Overall, 17 of our Top 20 tenants effectively paid full rent in April. In May so far 16 of our Top 20 tenants have paid rent.  Or approximately 37% of investment-grade tenancy for the total portfolio and 46% within retail were a strong component of April rent collections at almost a 100%. And well over 95% so far in May. Over 60% of our tenants are public in the overall portfolio and over 68% are public within the retail portfolio which we view very positively. Fortunately, we have a lot of geographic diversity with many of our properties spread out in areas of the country that have had less impact from the virus and many are in states that have started to reopen for business. Although, they remain a patchwork of restrictions based on regions of the country open now or opening soon in some capacity, we have 3,393 properties or 88% in these open locations. Only about 9.6% of our portfolio is in the hard-hit northeast with 2.3% and 3.1% in the hardest-hit states of New York and New Jersey respectively. The largest real estate teams in our company have always been our strong and our very experienced asset management and property management departments, which have served us well. These teams have been augmented in the past two months with personnel from underwriting and acquisitions. Collectively, they have been doing an outstanding job in trying circumstances and our collections to date are partially reflective of those efforts. And I will take this opportunity to thank them. Our dedicated property type asset management teams have been in discussion with our tenants to understand the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses. Rent relief requests have been received from tenants representing approximately 34% of rental income on an annualized basis. We have been evaluating each request on a case-by-case basis based on each tenant's unique financial and operating situation, analyzing metrics such as industry segments, geographic locations where they are operating; corporate financial health, rent coverage and the tenants' liquidity. Our goal has been to help those tenants we think need and deserve it in the short run, while at the same time pressing for payment from those tenants who we judge do not merit rent relief, have access to other forms of capital or being opportunistic. Of the received requests to date, a little over a third have been approved, about a third are in negotiations and about a third have either been denied or we have taken no action. The deferral agreements we have made generally have been in a two to four month range and pay back within 12-months with interest as appropriate. While we have generally structured any rent relief as deferral not abatement, in a small number of cases we have created rent per term for tenants we think will be here in the long term and where we think we've created value in a longer lease. It is worth noting again that the vast majority of our ARI comes from large public and private companies that have the financial resources and access to capital necessary to weather this storm. We do, however, have some smaller tenants and so we've also been monitoring the various government assistance programs, which we think can be helpful to some of our most impacted industries such as franchise restaurants and entertainment related retail. About half of the tenants with in the restaurant portfolio have applied to the Paycheck Protection Program and we expect some amount will have access to these funds. We also have been monitoring the new governmental initiatives such as the Main Street Lending Program which may help some of our larger tenants. Finally, as I noted above rent collections so far for May are 78% which is about 1% ahead of where we were during the same time period in April. As others have pointed out, many tenants went into April with some momentum from the first quarter with May be in the month where the full impact of the shutdown has been felt. With that in mind, we are very gratified with our collection levels so far for May. Our current expectation is that total collections for May will be approximately where April ended. Industrial is so far coming in a bit lower than April primarily to one tenant which paid in April and we believe can continue to pay. We are currently in discussions with that tenant. At this point, we think June collections will be in the range of collections for April and May. Further portfolio segment information and details can be found in our Investor presentation file today. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike Bartolotta : Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today. Our first quarter numbers really were on target. However, we recognize that going forward for some time it's a different environment and what's most important is our balance sheet and liquidity. Before I get into that though let me quickly discuss how we prepared as a company to ensure the smoothest transition to our virtual environment. We're currently operating essentially 100% remotely. Anticipating that an office shutdown was probable, our IT team quickly mobilized our business continuity plans and made sure we had equipment for all employees who are able to work effectively from home. Employees are utilizing virtual private networks in their homes to maintain a high level of security and we prepared training and awareness materials for employees to help them get set up and they continue to have access to a 24x7 IT support desk. In addition, the management committee participates in daily virtual meetings to make sure the business is operating efficiently. I've been impressed with how well everyone has been able to adapt during this difficult period and I'd like to thank our entire team for all of their efforts in keeping the business running as normal as possible. Turning to our balance sheet now. The company remains well positions with net debt to normalize EBITDA unchanged from year-end at 5.7x. A key focal point for us as a company has been maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet and we worked very hard over the last few years to gain back our investment grade rating. As Covid-19 pandemic continued to unfold, we initiated an additional draw in excess of normal operating requirements of $600 million on our revolving line of credit to enhance our cash position. As of May 15, VEREIT had corporate liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion comprised of $601 million in cash and cash equivalents and $588 million of availability under our credit facility. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remained healthy increasing to 3.3x and our net debt to gross real estate investment ratio was 39%. Our unencumbered asset ratio increased to 81%; the weighted average duration of our debt was 4.4 years and we are 86% fixed, which reflects the higher utilization of our line of credit this quarter. Additionally, we a very manageable amount of debt coming due in the near term. As of quarter end, we had $90 million in mortgage notes payable due this year at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5%. And we had a $322 million convertible bond due at the end of December. In 2021, we have $299 million in mortgage notes payable due throughout next year but no other corporate bonds coming due until 2024j. Based on what I see now, we see no issues with our covenants. Moving to our outlook. We withdrew guidance in April and are not providing an update at this time due to the uncertain market we all face; the Board of Directors is reducing the second quarter dividend from $0.1375 to $0.077 representing a decrease of 44%. The reduction was determined after extensive financial analysis. This allows us to prudently manage our debt levels and the balance sheet stability we work so hard for over the last five years. Board of Directors has not made any decisions with respect to its dividend policy beyond the second quarter and we'll continue to monitor the current environment and its impact on our tenants and business. Based on our estimate of taxable net income today, we see no issues with this reduction and satisfy our REIT requirements. And with that I will turn the call back to Glenn. Glenn Rufrano : Thanks Mike. Our defined corporate commitment is to always serve to the best of our ability, three main constituencies. Our stakeholders, tenants and employees. Our combined efforts continue to focus on all three. We transitioned our employees to a fully virtual work from home environment in the middle of March quickly new processes and business intelligence tracking tools were developed to assist and monitoring our tenants and potential risks that can come our way. We have a deeply experienced team here at the company not only on the executive management side, but within all of our real estate groups. As leasing and asset management becomes even more important during this time, we have transitioned some of our acquisition personnel as well as others to assist with navigating the challenges our tenants will be facing. Our legal staff, attorneys and paralegals are working to support our efforts. I also said on daily calls where we strive to come up with the best tenant solutions. Every request goes through a process and ends with a sign-off from our investment committee consisting of myself, Paul, Tom and Mike. Our dedicated employee teams have collectively exhibited great energy and resolve and we thank them. Mike presented our current balance sheet statistics. Of note we maintain net debt to EBITDA 5.7x. Our cash and revolving liquidity remains sufficient and our assets are highly liquid with 81% unencumbered. But the exception of our converts later this year. We have no corporate bonds due until 2024. The Board's decision to reduce the dividend for this quarter is not based generally upon a micro review of our business, but more importantly on a macro view when uncertain economy. The difficulty in predicting the duration of this economic disturbance is glaring. Possibilities are extraordinarily wide. When you know where you are, you can better judge what to do and how to do it. While we are getting a better view of tenant receipts with April and May, duration can have a variety of outcomes.  Our view is that with such uncertainties strong balance sheet maintains stakeholder value. The sizing of the dividend was based upon a series of financial analyses, dissecting a range of possible outcomes throughout this year and next. We chose this base amount on which to build the dividend while protecting against any increase in debt. As more information is available in each of the next two quarters, this decision will be under constant review. As you heard in Paul's presentation, our portfolio diversification is serving us well not only by property type, but also investment grade parentage, credit, industry and geographic limits, as well as a high percentage of public companies. We will of course reevaluate the portfolio parameters as we move throughout this year. While we are in a very difficult environment, our business model provides the ability to grow and thrive once we get past this. Although disappointed that 2020 will be a transition year, our experience in transforming the company over the last five years will provide strength to get us through this. Our expectations for the future is that our liquid balance sheet, diversified portfolio, experienced team and partnerships will all perform and reignite hopefully in 2021. Before ending, I would like to applaud those in the healthcare profession and all first responders who have made such a difference in our lives, certainly mine. I also want to take this time to thank everyone for their kind notes during my recovery from the virus. They were great pick me ups, and very much appreciate it. I'll now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Haendel Juste from Mizuho. Go ahead. HaendelJuste: Hey, good afternoon. And Glenn, good to hear your voice again. Glad that budget back and well again. So first question is more high level to think about the portfolio and curious on how Covid and life in the aftermath of Covid might be impacting your view on your portfolio allocation and subcategory exposures going forward. Clearly having a bit more office and industrial has been beneficial. So I'm curious how the thinking yours, the board might be evolving here on portfolio balance effect or allocation post Covid? Thank you. GlennRufrano: Sure. Thank Haendel. And thanks for your kind note. As you know, we -- as you followed us, Haendel, and others we've been pretty disciplined since 2018. The portfolio at that time we generally not understood and so we try to make sure the market understood what we were thinking in the future. We put metrics around a number of elements here, percentages of property type, tenant credit, investment grade rating, geography and a number of others, all to provide diversification. So we have always thought that understanding the portfolio long term is the right thing to do. And we will continue due to that in future. So that's before. Now let's if I took us to just January first and we thought about where our portfolio should be, we'd be saying certain things like experiential real estates a good idea because it's a bridge against e-commerce and restaurants and entertainment is pretty good. We also had a number of conversations on these calls about pharmacies. Well, would pharmacies be best or not be best in the portfolio, that's turned around today. We have all turned around today based upon this pandemic in terms of what property types may or may not perform over periods of time. The one thing that I say for us now thinking about the portfolio is that we're not going to make decisions based upon what's happened today. We're in the middle of the storm. We're going to wait for some of this storm to subside before we make decisions on where the metrics will be and how we will reshape the portfolio. I believe there will be some reshaping but how we will shape is very hard for us to judge right now. To your point some property types like office are now performing well. Our industrial performance is very good and the only thing -- the only constant denominator that I can take out of what's happened over the last five to six years is that diversification is a plus, will always be diversified but we may change some of our metrics in the future. We're just not ready to do that yet, Haendel. HaendelJuste: Got it. And thank you for the perspective, appreciated. And then a bit more on the dividend, appreciate your comments earlier but I was hoping if you could give us a bit more perspective on the process to cut the second quarter specifically at 44%. Some reason other sectors have opted to cut the dividend or suspend until the end of the year and make a final determination; others have credit immediately, so I'm curious on why 44% to second quarter versus these other options and perhaps are we trying to read too much into it to suggest or to think that this suggests an estimated recovery of maybe 90-ish percent of your cash flows, prior cash flow pre Covid. So any other context around your thinking here and what maybe we should be reading into it. Thank you. GlennRufrano: No, good, another good question. Certainly that was a difference this quarter. The first, I'd say it's not easy -- it's not an easy decision to reduce a dividend, it's just not. Make your feet burn and your stomachs turn when you have to make a decision like that but we as a company and the board thought it was necessary to make that decision. The decision itself as I mentioned wasn't only based upon the macro review what's happening today, it's more importantly it was really based upon the uncertainty of what's happening in the economy. It's a very difficult to predict duration here and we have -- will all have a hard time on duration and that will play a very important role in what and how our tenants will run their businesses. But what we decided was that we would take a look at various outcomes of what can happen over the next year or two. We have a basis in April and May which is helpful that it was better than the sort of April. I'm not sure we knew what was going to happen. We have a better feel for April and May and you've heard Paul talk about June and if we looked at the uncertainties in the future, the common denominator we saw was that we needed to maintain a strong balance sheet. But at the same time since we had, I'd say substantial cash flow over the last couple of months not a 100% which is what we wanted, but cash flow we thought it was fair to pay some of that cash flow to the shareholder. The question now was the balance of the two. The balance of the two comes with the sizing of the dividend, which is really a question. And we did that by starting and reviewing a series of financial analyses. We really did dissect possible outcomes through this year and next. And our guiding light was can we come up with a base amount of a dividend build on but at the same time protect against any increase in debt. And those were the two relationships that we work towards. And if you, if I were to try to describe our analyses, I would try to describe them in terms of a V, a U and a W. The V being a quick recovery; U being a slower recovery and perhaps the beginning of the U higher than the end of U and a W where clearly the middle of the W is not going to be equal to the left-hand side of it. I was just reading an article and it's almost the discussion between Minuchin and Powell. Minuchin would say it's a V; Powell would say it's a U or W. We seriously looked at all three of those which is really used on duration and based upon those views, we thought dividend which was $0.077 this quarter represented a sustainable dividend to build on. Now we're not -- we just provided second quarter dividend. We're not approving the third or fourth quarter dividend by any means and clearly if there's any real big disturbance in the economy, we're not sure that base but right now we think that's a very solid base on which to build a dividend. And that build will occur when we think it's appropriate relative to what we're seeing in the environment on a day to day basis. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Go ahead. SheilaMcGrath: Yes. Good afternoon. Welcome back, Glenn. Can you give us give us some perspective on credit loss typically for your portfolio maybe historically over time? And how you view the credit loss for the portfolio in the near term? And just following on that do you expect to be converting some leases to cash accounting in the near term? GlennRufrano: Good. I think that those are two very good questions, Sheila and I'm going to pass the first one on credit to Paul and then Paul I would ask you to pass on in terms of accounting to Mike. So Paul, you take that first one. PaulMcDowell: Sure. Of course. Hi, Sheila. With respect to credit losses in the portfolio we've been pretty fortunate and that we've had very low credit losses over the past few years. So we haven't had much in the way of credit losses. We have had the few small bankruptcies as you know from time to time and we generally, we've lost that credit but we've also been able to relet the properties and regain cash flows. From a going-forward perspective here, we don't know exactly where this all ends up and as Glenn mentioned in his remarks the key here duration. We went into this pandemic with a credit watch list that generally runs between 2% and 2% of adjusted rents and now suddenly we have a lot of credits in our portfolio that are very healthy companies that are through no fault of their own suddenly under a significant amount of credit stress. And the question is how long does that stress last. We're fortunate in that most of the portfolio is made up of public companies and they've got access to capital. So we're pretty confident that most of our tenants will be able to jump the ditch here and resume being the healthy companies they were before. But it's a little too early to give you a sense at this moment about where we expect credit losses to come to rest since we don't yet know the duration. And I think with that I'll give Mike the accounting question. MikeBartolotta: Hi, Sheila. It's Mike. I think the accounting question is really going to come down to the fact that typically before we have the pandemic if we had some deferrals or some changes to any of our leases, we would have treated it as a lease modification under 842, but the FASB came out with what they're calling an expediency because they understood that everyone is going to or many people were going to be dealing with deferral situations and what the new FASB says is the expediency says if you have a situation where you have no real substantial change in the original contracts cash flow, but rather just typically you have a two, three, four months deferral and then you collect that rent, let's say over the next six months or a year so that can be handled under this new expediency and the expediency has a couple of decision points. One is it reasonable that you're going to be able to make that collection during that period. If the answer is yes, you can then simply treat the revenue as you normally would and establish a receivable during those deferral periods and you would record the revenue during the deferral periods as regular revenue, you set up a receivable and your AFFO, your NOI and your normalized EBITDA would all reflect it as if it were included in those amounts which is different than if there was a lease amendment. They do give you the option of something called variable accounting which is very similar to cash accounting. I'm not quite sure why one would want to use that given this other treatment, but you do have to first make a decision about collectability if you think there's some doubt about collectability then you account for it on a cash basis. And then the last option is if you're actually changing the terms of the lease and that could be typically a blend and extended for some reason, someone is getting a month or two of free rent and extreme say for three to five year extension on the lease, you do have to go back and do the normal 842 lease modification accounting. So that decision tree is something we'll be going through every completed transaction and deciding which bucket it belongs in and how we account for it. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Metz from BMO. Go ahead. JeremyMetz: Hey, guys. Paul, I was hoping you could -- two parts. Just one could you give us an update on the latest with Art Van and your boxes there? And then going back to the rent relief request, I guess I'm just curious how you balance the fine line between granting deferrals and not granting. I mean arguably just because someone could pay many retailers see others getting deferral, so how do you balance keeping those tenants healthy, happy and in place so giving others breathing room particularly on the retail and restaurants. PaulMcDowell: You just want me to go straight into this, Glenn? GlennRufrano: Yes. Go. Paul, yes, I thought Jeremy -- thanks Jeremy for -- he directed it and I should have redirected it to make sure Paul gets it, I don't answer it because Paul, he'll answer that question better than I will. PaulMcDowell: Sure. With respect to Art Van, as you may remember we have eight stores, Art Van declared bankruptcy pre Covid and their bankruptcy had nothing to do with Covid. But subsequently they have decided to liquidate. We have got all those stores on the market and we have an LOI in place at the moment with a very experienced operator for four of the eight and had about 70% of the previous rents and the remaining four are on the market. With respect to the delicate balance between how do we manage deferral request from tenants, I touched on it in the script and I think you're accurate in calling it a delicate balance because there's a lot of things at play. We have what is the size of our balance sheet and liquidity and on the one hand what is the size of the tenants' balance sheet and their liquidity on the other. What are their likelihood of getting capital from other sources and we also have tenant relationships to think about how often do we interact with that tenant, how often -- when do we have renewals coming up and so on and so forth. All of those factors come into play. So and I say we've had deferral request across the range. We've had some sort of deferral requests that have been launched from tenants who clearly have got the ability to pay and are just asking for deferrals because everyone else seems to be asking for deferrals. And those we generally just simply deny and then we have other tenants where they're clearly in significant distress. And we have to make a judgment about whether or not we are in a position to really help them. And if we can help them for how much and for how long. And so we make those judgments every day. We have a committee that meets several times a week. I meet with our asset managers virtually every day to talk about each and every one of these. And we go through a committee process and once we make a judgement it goes up and then Mike, Glenn and I make a judgement about what to do. JeremyMetz: I appreciate the color. And if I could just go back and ask one follow-up on the Art Van based on your comments that four are going with the very experienced operator. It sounds like this is a different operator than the one we heard a couple of your net lease peers shuck a deal, is that correct? PaulMcDowell: That's correct. JeremyMetz: All right. And then, Tom, I was just wondering on the deal front, it seems like there are still assets that are out there. You saw some 10.31 money sloshing around that we're hearing about. We're about two months into this, so I just wanted it if any color on what's happening on the ground? Are you seeing deals go under contract and what's the sort of early read on pricing? How much our yields resetting at this point? If there is activity, that's still happening. GlennRufrano: You got it, Tom. TomRoberts: Sure. So as Glenn mentioned we're on pause as well as most of our peers, so not a lot of activity in the market right now particularly in the retail sector. I just think that's too early to pick up -- pick an impact on the market. Although you did mention there is 10.31 exchange activities in the market which we've been active selling some assets to those type buyers. But despite, by far the strongest product type is industrial which is what we buy in our partnership with our Korean partner. There we've seen some pause in the market but probably just maybe 10%, 20% impact on pricing. Seller expectations have moderated slightly but we think there's going to be activity in that market as well. Office would be the same for single tenant long-term investment grade credits. I think the market is held up pretty well probably in that same price range. And we hope to be active in both those front end partnerships in the second half of the year. We do have a partnership transaction that we announced in our last call. A very large industrial project about 2.3 million square feet at $247 million transaction that we anticipate will close here mid-year. We also have two other builder suits that were under contract with that would close in that third or fourth quarter. So we remain active. They have been impacted by Covid but certainly we hope that both partnerships will be active in the second half of the year. So I think generally too soon too early to tell, but we, I think generally in our space and the industrial and office side and even the investment grade or higher quality retail will have very little impact on pricing, very small. JeremyMetz: And so no VEREIT price --sorry, Glenn. Go ahead. GlennRufrano: No. I just wanted to make sure, Jeremy, what Tom said I think I misunderstood. Tom you had mentioned 10 to 25 in cap rates and not percent decline. TomRoberts: Yes. Very small percent. GlennRufrano: I misunderstood, sorry I just misunderstood. TomRoberts: 10 or 20 basis point which is far less than 5% impact on pricing and a lot of it just has to do with deal that's in place at the time. How badly does the seller want to sell? But I think generally this type product type is very stable long-term credit leases no matter what the product type is, has held up pretty well I think at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Paolone from J.P. Morgan. Go ahead. AnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thanks and glad you are well, Glenn. Question for Paul. You mentioned your view that June should look pretty close to April and May. I was wondering if you could just talk with a little more detail in terms of as you look inside the portfolio and what's happening at the asset level, where things look like they might be improving versus areas of the portfolio where it could be worse if things linger for a few more months like this. PaulMcDowell: Sure. Yes. So we're -- we've been building up our point of view about where tenants are coming out. We're very lucky in that most of our portfolio is very steady right. It's necessity based retail. It's office and industrial so most of our cash flows we feel very, very comfortable about. We will continue no matter kind of no matter what then it's really at the margin here where we're looking which tenants have paid, which tenants haven't paid. We're in negotiations with pretty much every single tenant who's asked for a deferral request. So we are talking to them and by talking to them, the asset management teams are able to make a judgment about where they see payment streams coming in the coming months. So we've got April and May under our belts now. We predicted where we thought those would come out. They come out close to where we predicted they would. And so we feel we have pretty decent insight into June, June so far. With respect to areas where we see improvement I think when we look operationally, the most market improvement is in the one that we would like to see improve the most that is in the restaurant portfolio. Initially many of our restaurant tenants were hit very significantly by the pandemic slowdown. And now many of them particularly in the QSR portfolio, sales are only down 10% to 20% which while still very, very significant they can operate profitably at those levels. We've also seen improvement in casual dining. A lot of our tenants didn't really have large to go infrastructures in place or we're just developing them when the pandemic hit. They have hit obviously the fast-forward button on those and it varies across the different brands, but they are improving their to-go performance and so their sales while down initially sort of in the 80% range are now down sort of in the 50% range. So we are seeing some significant cash flow improvements in the casual dining in a casual dining sector so and in the QSR sectors. So I think that's encouraging as we start to open back up. AnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thank you for that. And then another question as I look at your expiration schedule. You got a couple points this year about 7% next year, is there any portion of that you know at this point is going to vacate that could be a challenge or that's notable for us? GlennRufrano: Yes. I mean nothing particular as you know that we do have 7% coming due next year and we work hard at chipping away at that stuff in advance. So you noticed in my prepared remarks that we had some early renewals and those early renewals actually hits even further out in 2022 and 2023. In 2021m the expirations are pretty granular. We have sort of 180 leases in total that will expire, 70 to 75 each in retail and restaurants. So at this stage, don't see any particularly large holes where we say, oh, we think a large number those will not renew. We will move through the renewal process and we've been doing renewals even during the pandemic and even in some of the restaurants portfolio have been reasonably routine so far. So we'll see how that plays out in the coming months and I think you'll see us beginning to pull our 2021 expirations down as this year as a remainder of 2020 progresses. AnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thanks and just last question for, Mike, with about 80% -81% collections seems like it's where you think the quarter will end up. Is anything you need to do from a debt or line covenant point of view that we should watch now for? MikeBartolotta: No. We are fine on the covenants. I mentioned that in my remarks and we're fine from that perspective. And we believe that where we are right now, we've drawn down the line so that we have about $600 million of cash and quite $600 million available so we feel comfortable with that mix of having $1.2 billion of liquidity broken into those two pieces. So I don't see any issues on that. We have some debt coming due about $400 million in total this year. Most of that is $320 some-odd million right at the end of December on a convert. So obviously we'll be looking at how we'll refinance that going forward. A month ago the IG markets were BBB or BBB minus, were not as good in the last three weeks or so. They've gotten much better still a little bit pricey, but we have a lot of time between now and then to make that decision plus a lot of liquidity. As we've always tried, we'll keep our options open so that we make the right decision as to how we refining that obligation. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Go ahead. ChrisLucas: Well. Hey, Glenn. Thanks. It's good to hear your voice and then I guess just generally a couple quick questions for you guys. Mike you mentioned about how you're thinking about the debt that's coming due at the end of the year. If you had to price your long-term debt today what sort of spread over treasuries do you think it would be at? MikeBartolotta: I think today we're somewhere for a 10-year or somewhere around $450 million over Treasuries. I mean that there's been kind of a tremendous --the spread between the spreads of say A and BBB plus and then we're a mix of BBB minus and BBB right. We have one BBB and two BBB minus rating. So that's spread within the net lease group is pretty wide. So I would say right now we're somewhere in the 400 range on a 10-year between say 400 -- GlennRufrano: And, Chris, could I make one comment there because it's a very, very important subject for us in terms of pricing our capital and part of the balancing of the dividend that I discussed earlier. We hope will help us in the debt markets if we have to get into lease markets and we'd like to potentially this year so the spread and our ability to provide more cash flow in the balance sheet, we're hoping we get some momentum that it helps us there. ChrisLucas: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Mike, just on the credit facility. Can you remind us is your EBITDA test, is that a single quarter, two quarters, annualized, four quarter trailing, what's that look like? MikeBartolotta: It's a quarter annualized right now. That's the way we do the total asset test. You take the NOI and it's a 7% gross up and then you times it by four. ChrisLucas: Okay. Were -well, and then I guess just going, Paul, maybe on the rent relief mechanics just so I understand them. You're basically offering two to four months then there's like a one-year pay back period. I guess I am just trying to understand when you guys starting to expect the payback period to start? Would it be after the end of the rent relief period or would there be some sort of interim period before that would start up? PaulMcDowell: That's a good question and I would say that the answer to that runs the gamut. So, we have a variety of deferral requests and sometimes those deferral requests are for a 100% of rent; sometimes they're for percentages of the rent; 25% or 50% of the rent. We obviously negotiate each and every one and payback periods are sort of the same kind of ilk. Some payback periods we have running almost immediately after the deferral is over. And they run sometimes a pretty short period of time, a couple of months. Other payback periods we have where they start up after a couple of months with the tenant back at their normal rents to give them some breathing room. And build up some capital and then start to pay them again. A few we have deferred out into 2021 at least that's the idea right now, but again it's very, very dependent upon the tenants circumstance; the tenants financial situation and sort of our idea of how quickly we think they will recover and we as mentioned in my remarks too, we typically charge interest on deferral and sometimes that has an impact on the tenants\u2019 desire to pay back their deferred balances more quickly. ChrisLucas: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess just when you're talking to tenants about their rent deferral request does the PPP program or Main Street Lending Program become a prerequisite for that conversation or how is that -- how are you factoring that into the conversation, if at all? PaulMcDowell: Yes. No. We do factor it in and as I said before most of our tenants are large public companies or large private companies. So a lot of them except in the restaurant portfolio most didn't really qualify for PPP, but what we have in our agreements that we're working on with our various tenants at the moment is generally if they receive funds from the government that can be earmarked for rent. They need to pay those funds to us in rent and that's not generally controversial as we talk to these tenants. So they say, look, we get money from the government, we're happy to send it to you in the form of rent. ChrisLucas: Okay. And then my last question just as it relates to the leasing activity particularly the early renewals, were there any sort of rent relief structures that were part of that or is it truly just early renewal type activity? PaulMcDowell: No. Yes, the early renewal activity we had was sort of the standard early renewal activity that we have and we mentioned no recapture rates and so and so forth. And so very often when we do what we would call a blended colloquially, a blend and extend. We typically or we occasionally will grant some free rent or some rent reductions upfront in exchange for a much, much longer lease, which gives us obviously an improved net asset value. So sometimes we'll trade a little of upfront rent in exchange for the longer-term lease, but the activity that we had in the first quarter on early renewals in that vein was completely routine. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Go ahead. SheilaMcGrath: I guess I was wondering I know it's early but I was just wondering what your expectations are for pricing on acquisition? Do you expect cap rates to increase despite the low interest rate environment? And do you expect any differentiation between like restaurant or experiential tenants to widen out more than grocery or pharmacy? GlennRufrano: Tom, maybe I'll start and then I may kick it to you. Tom as mentioned before which I would agree with retail is really tough. I'm not sure how you would price some of the entertainment properties today or even I'm sure there's some pricing on a grocer-anchored shopping center, but I think that's pretty difficult and I don't think there's a lot of comps there. So I would agree with what Tom said before retail right now if there is a bid-ask, it's wide and so very difficult to figure out. The only assets that I think Tom has been looking at where there is some pricing is investment-grade, industrial and investment-grade office. And Tom, why don't you just kind of come back on those two -- we see those two more often now because we're still looking at them for industrial partnership and our office partnerships. So Tom? TomRoberts: Yes. Glenn, I would agree an experiential retail any type of fitness entertainment is just -- there's just not a lot of activity in the market. So I would agree that just not been priced. As Glenn mentioned, we are very active in the industrial and the office fronts with our partners and there again there's not a lot of trades. I think generally unless you really had to sell it you're going to put things on hold for 60-90 days. There has been some transactions that have awarded a bidder and I think as I mentioned earlier probably 10-20 basis point adjustment upward in the cap rate which is a very small percentage below 5%. So we think those are held up really well. I mean just the product types industrial is generally probably the number one product type in the market that has fared very well with e-commerce.  So those prices as you would expect have maintained very strong by comparison. And I think offices as well generally long term, decent credit, and good credit tenants that pricing hasn't moved much. And I think going forward we're obviously on hold and we'll just see where the market goes between now and year end. SheilaMcGrath: Okay. Thank you. I guess we need new business interruption insurance. GlennRufrano: Well, the ICFC as you probably know, Sheila, is working very hard on that. It's called -- they don't want to call it business interruption insurance because the insurance companies don't want to think of it that way, but so it's called the Recovery Act, a business Recovery Act and we've been before Congress as part of the ICFC. I've been helpful there at least in the last few weeks trying to in the fourth phase of government subsidy, provide for some of what you're asking for. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for closing remarks. Glenn Rufrano : I thank everybody for joining us today. And look forward to speaking to many of you over the next few months. We'll talk certainly at NAREIT. And I wish you the best. Thank you very much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Keisha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2020 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Crum, Associate Director of Realty Income. You may begin. Andrew Crum : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s second quarter 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Capital Markets and Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question when they turning to Q&A portion of the call, in order to get everyone the opportunity to participate. If you\u2019d like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. I\u2019d like to start by expressing my gratitude and appreciation towards my colleagues, whose resiliency and determination to remaining extremely productive in the face of the current pandemic continues to drive our business. We are one team, and all employees have embraced this concept through effective communication and collaboration while working remotely. Further, we empathize with the individuals and businesses impacted by COVID-19 and we continue to partner with our clients to seek mutually beneficial outcomes. Our operating results for the second quarter continue to demonstrate the stability and resiliency of our business as we generated AFFO per share of $0.86 and ended the quarter with a portfolio occupancy of 98.5%. During the quarter, we invested over $154 million in high-quality real estate, including $58 million invested internationally in the UK, which brings us to $640 million invested year-to-date. Our quarter end to date \u2013 end net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times positions us well going forward with significant financial flexibility. While uncertainty remains due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, which primarily focuses on owning real estate leased to essential retail and industrial tenants continues to perform well. Rent collection since hitting a low of 84.9% in May has steadily improved. And as of July 31, we have collected 86.5% of contractual rent for the second quarter. We have collected 99.1% of contractual rent for the second quarter from investment-grade-rated tenants, which further validates the importance of a high-quality real estate portfolio leads to large, well capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade-rated tenants as a primary objective, during the periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last few months have proven out. For the month of July, we have collected 91.5% of contractual rent, which represents the second consecutive month of improved rent collection and the highest monthly rent collection since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater, health and fitness and restaurant industries as these industries account for approximately 81% of uncollected rent during the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to expect to collect the vast majority of uncollected rent as we continue to consider and negotiate rent deferral agreements on a case-by-case basis. We disclosed in our financial supplement the percentage of contractual rent collected by industry. Our top four industries : convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores and grocery stores, each sell essential goods and represents approximately 37% of rental revenue. And we have received almost all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries for the second quarter. Other industries, such as theaters, health and fitness and restaurants have been challenged due to store closures and social distancing guidelines, but we are encouraged by improved rent collection in recent months. We remain constructive on the long-term viability of these industries, particularly given our partnership with the top operators in each of these verticals. The success of the theater industry has largely been tied to the quality of films produced by Hollywood, and the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recently as 2018. Additionally, the economic business model for studios continues to suggest, in our view, that the theater distribution channel will remain attractive going forward. We also expect the non-discretionary and low price point propositions of the quick service restaurant and health and fitness industries to support resiliency of their rent paying capabilities, particularly as their businesses begin to reopen in certain areas of the country. As we continue to manage our portfolio to support long-term value creation, we believe the breadth and depth of our asset management and real estate operations department, which is our company\u2019s largest department, is a key competitive advantage vis-a-vis our competitors. Moving on to investment activity during the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $154 million in 32 properties located in 15 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of a 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 41% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade-rated tenants. 100% of the revenues were generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 14 different tenants in eight industries. We closed six discrete transactions in the second quarter and approximately 9% of second quarter investment volume for sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $154 million invested during the quarter, $96 million were invested domestically in 30 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. During the quarter, $58 million was invested internationally in two properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 9.9 years. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve invested $640 million in 94 properties located in 25 states in the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average initial lease term of 13.6 years. On a revenue basis, 37% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade-rated tenants, 97% of the revenues are generated from retail and 3% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 29 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 23 independent transactions year-to-date and approximately 22% of year-to-date investment volume for a sale-leaseback transaction. Of the $640 million invested year-to-date, $416 million was invested domestically in 88 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.3 years. Year-to-date, approximately $224 million was invested internationally in six properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $14.5 billion in the second quarter. Of the $14.5 billion sourced during the quarter, $9 billion was domestic opportunities and $5.5 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 65% of the volume sourced for the second quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 55% were portfolios and 45% or approximately $6.5 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $32.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, $19.3 billion were domestic opportunities and $13.3 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 49% of the volume sourced year-to-date. Of the $32.6 billion sourced year-to-date, 56% were portfolios and 44% were one-off assets. Of the $154 million in total acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 41% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital during the quarter averaged approximately 131 basis points. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Looking forward, our investment pipeline remains robust, and we are well positioned with strong financial flexibility. Accordingly, we are reinstating 2020 acquisition guidance with a range of $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. Moving on to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 12 properties for net proceeds of $7.4 million and we realized an unlevered IRR of 6.1%. This brings us to 29 properties sold year-to-date for $133.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.2% and we realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. Our portfolio is well diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 tenants in 50 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. 84% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6% rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today\u2019s retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.7 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.5 times. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.5%, consistent with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we released 65 properties, recapturing 101.4% of the expiring rent. During the first half of 2020, we released 158 properties recapturing 100.1% of expiring rents. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 3,300 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 0.4% during the quarter and 0.2% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by write-offs, we recognized in the restaurant industry as well as partially due to a change in methodology, as we are now recognizing percentage rent during the period it is accrued rather than during the period it is paid. Moving on, I\u2019ll provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, starting with income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue for the quarter was 4.8%. Our year-to-date G&A expense ratio excluding approximately $3.5 million severance related to the departure of our former CFO, was 4.6%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, reflecting our best in class efficiency and the scale benefits afforded to us given our size. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of rental and other revenue was 1.4% for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.86, which includes approximately $60.2 million or $0.17 per share on a fully diluted basis of deferred and unpaid rent that we deemed earned during the period and probable of being collected during the existing lease term. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain only a handful of REITs with at least two A ratings. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes due 2031 within effective yield to maturity of 3.36%. And subsequent to quarter end, we add an additional $315 million at an effective yield to maturity of 2.34% blending out to just shy of 3% for the entire $950 million of notes. Additionally, we raised approximately $98.1 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. Year-to-date, we have raised over $1.8 billion of well-priced capital, including approximately $874 million of equity and $950 million of debt. We ended the quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics, but the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times and the fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.4 times. We continue to have very strong liquidity with approximately $400 million of cash on hand and $2.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility as of July 31, which provides us significant financial flexibility. Looking forward, overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, as a weighted average maturity of a bond is 8.3 years. Additionally, we have nest in $140 million of debt coming due through 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and ample liquidity. In June, we increase the dividend for the 107 time in our company\u2019s history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.5%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, but having increase the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. Moving on, we have always managed the business with a focus on economic resiliency and generating stable and increasing cash flow through a variety of economic environments. And we continue to do so through the current climate of uncertainty driven by COVID-19. We deliberately designed a high quality real estate portfolio leased primarily to tenants providing non-discretionary or low price point goods or services, as well as with the focus on partnering with large well-capitalized operators who are leaders in their respective industries. Our judicious balance sheet management and the strength of our financial position are evidenced by 2A credit ratings and our current financial flexibility and liquidity positions us favorably to capitalize and growing opportunities going forward. And we have reinstated 2020 acquisitions guidance with a range of $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. At this time, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Shivani Sood from Deutsche Bank. Shivani Sood : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Touching on the investment pipeline, I\u2019m just curious, in terms of potential acquisitions, the depth of the buyer pool that you\u2019re seeing out there in terms of competition. And how it compares to pre-COVID levels? I guess, is it mostly public buyers or private and has it been different for larger portfolio transaction? Sumit Roy : Yes, it\u2019s a very good question, Shivani. The way to answer it is, for the high quality essential retail product, the competition for that product remains fierce. And in fact, it\u2019s translating into cap rates that I would say has tightened vis-\u00e0-vis pre-COVID levels. And so in terms of number of potential buyers, looking at that product continues to be very strong. I would say that we don\u2019t see as many public net lease companies in the space today. And this is an overall comment as we did pre-COVID. But given what we\u2019ve heard in the recent second quarter earnings announcement, I expect that that\u2019s going to change. But at least over the second quarter and in transactions that we pursued more recently, the number of public buyers tend to be less. On the international side, however, the number of buyers and most of the time we\u2019re competing with private institutes has continued to be very strong. And in fact, there have been occasions where we walked away from transactions that were right down the fairway for us, but because of pricing getting very, very competitive. So in general, I would say that all the products that we are pursuing the competition remains strong and I expect that most of the public net lease buyers are going to stop playing in that space sooner now. Shivani Sood : And then as a follow-up, in terms of the reinstated investment guidance, could that strengthen the UK markets suggest that more those investment volumes to be sourced in the U.S. versus the UK. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Look, I think the UK market and I\u2019d say the overall European market has continued to be a very strong source of growth for us. There were about $650 million worth of sale lease back opportunities that basically take all of the criteria that you\u2019d be looking for outside of pricing. And given our disciplined approach to acquisitions, we chose to not continue to pursue those transactions. And if you look at the sourcing numbers, of the $34 billion, $13 billion was \u2013 has been sourced internationally. And that is well above what we had originally anticipated when we went into the UK market. And so the product remains strong in the international markets. I would say that even here in the U.S., our sourcing numbers is a testament to it. There remains plenty of products, both on the sale lease back side of the equation, as well as on the one off market. And the reason why we felt very comfortable reinstating our acquisition guidance is a testament to the pipeline that we currently have. The discussions that we currently have with our relationship tenants and what we are seeing on the sourcing side of the equation. Shivani Sood : Thanks very much for that color. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Nate Crossett : Can you guys hear me? Sumit Roy : There\u2019s a bit of static, but we can hear you. Nate Crossett : You guys mentioned that you\u2019ve seen some tightening for the high quality product. Obviously, you guys have a lot of it. I\u2019m just wondering if you guys are considering selling some of it into this attractive pricing and maybe you\u2019re redeploying that capital elsewhere. Sumit Roy : Look, our business philosophy has been that the products that we like we would like to hold it forever, and I\u2019m being a bit facetious there. But the idea being that, trying to time the market and sell when we believe that the cap rates are low and et cetera. Doesn\u2019t always play out and our history has proven that if we hold onto assets and continue to work with our partners or whom these assets are deemed critical, we will create value and we will create value with less volatility and of equivalent nominal terms. And that has sort of proven out to be the case, but that\u2019s not to say that opportunistically, we won\u2019t take advantage of the market like we did in the first quarter, where on the consumer electronic side of the business, we decided to sell the assets back to our tenants with whom we were having discussions of looking at other opportunities. But also looking to, to potentially help them address some of their own objectives, and we were able to generate 11% unlevered IRR based on selling those assets back. But our philosophy is, let\u2019s buy the assets that work for our tenants. Let\u2019s get into very long-term leases with minimal to zero capital invested in those assets. And we will create value, especially, if it continues to work for our tenants. And that continues to be our philosophy. Nate Crossett : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one on the pipeline, I was wondering, if you guys could just give a little color on how much of it is retail versus industrial. And then The same in the UK, you mentioned $13 billion sourcing, just curious how much of that is retail versus industrial? Sumit Roy : Yes. I would say the vast majority is retail. It\u2019s not to say that we are not seeing industrial. Those are the only two products that we are really looking at right now, Nate. But I would say, anywhere between 60% to 70% of what we are sourcing is on the retail side of the ledger. And 30% to 40% is going to be on the industrial side. Look, it\u2019s no secret. We want to grow the industrial portion of our asset type. It\u2019s something that we are very much focused on. We have made a concerted effort to cultivate relationships with folks, who could potentially provide us with this product. And it is starting to take shape and we are being able to generate some transaction flow from that side of the business, but what\u2019s keeps us a little bit on the sidelines, continues to be the fact that our cost of capital is not quite where it was four months ago. And if that were no longer a constraint in terms of the product itself and what\u2019s available. There is plenty of very good product in the industries that we want to participate in with operators that we would love to grow our relationship with. And so yes, it\u2019s about 60% to 70%, 30% to 40% is the split. Nate Crossett : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Christy McElroy : Hi, thank you so much. Sumit, just a follow-up on those comments and your comments on balance sheet and capital raising. Just in terms of your desire to do more of these deals. From a capital raising standpoint, you recently issued debt, you did an equity raise earlier this year or you just did some more on the ATM, but you tend to run at a conservative leverage level. So as you think about doing more deals and you mentioned cost of capital just from a funding standpoint, what should we expect in terms of further equity raises in the context of your guidance? Sumit Roy : Yes, that\u2019s a good question, Christy. We believe that we can get to the midpoint of our guidance without having to necessarily rely upon the equity market \u2013 the capital markets. And still stay within what we would deem as conservative what our rating agencies would deem as being in line with the ratings that we have. Having said that, our hope is that with continued positive results on the operating side of the business and continuing to post information that will allow our cost of equity to improve that opportunistically, we will be happy to continue to raise equity capital. But the point I want to leave you with is, we don\u2019t have to do that. Part of the reason why we entered 2011 and we did the very large equity raise was to get in a situation, where we had created enough of a capacity and had under leveraged our balance sheet coming out in March, where if we needed to lean on the debt capital markets, which seem to have corrected a lot sooner than the equity markets have, we could lean on that side of the equation and still stay within levels that, that our rating agencies would continue to support the 2 A ratings. So that\u2019s where we are. Christy McElroy : And then just to follow-up on your comments on theater. Just to two things really, how much of the theater and non-payment of rents could ultimately turn into vacancy in your view. And then just from a broader perspective, you talked about the economic model, what are your thoughts on that economic model changing in light of the recent AMC universal deal and other deals that could follow that in terms of theater operator\u2019s ability to pay the kind of rent that they\u2019re paying today? Sumit Roy : Yes. Look, let\u2019s talk about AMC. We\u2019ve just agreed to terms of AMC. They started paying partial rent in the month of July, which was a very good signal to us. We\u2019ve entered into a payback on the deferred rent that we\u2019ve entered into. And the payback is going to be longer. It\u2019s going to have \u2013 the average payback is going to be 2.7 years. But the fact that we were able to enter into an agreement with AMC, the fact that they were able to start paying us rent for the month of July. These are good signs. Look, we\u2019re seeing the same thing that you\u2019re seeing. The advantage that we have is we can pick up the phone and we can have a conversation with the AMC. And what they\u2019ve shared with us with regards to the agreement that they\u2019ve entered into with Universal is the basic premise for them doing this. Was that they believe that within the first 17 days, they get 75% to 90% of the box office revenues. And for the blockbusters, they generate 90% of the receipts within the first three weeks. So they didn\u2019t believe that there would be significant cannibalization since the movie will be advertised as PVOD only after the first two weeks of the theatrical release. And the fact that they also get a share of the PVOD revenues is another source of revenue stream that gave them comfort. But the basic premise was that the economic pie in entering into this sort of an agreement is actually going to increase for both parties. And so listen, time will tell, we\u2019ve run our own scenarios based on the information that AMC has shared. And at the corporate level, we believe that, they\u2019ll be either at 0% to negative 5% of the profitability creating this arrangement. And so we\u2019ll see. But they at least feel confident enough to have entered into an agreement with us. They started paying showing \u2013 they\u2019ve started paying rent for the month of July partial rent. But all of that continues to help support the thesis that we have that the AMC should come out, okay. Based on our own independent analysis, Christy, we think that they will be fine through November, even in the scenario where they have zero openings. And then obviously if we \u2013 if this slowdown continues and more and more theaters are shut down or they\u2019re unable to open that theaters as they\u2019ve shared with us, which is August 20th, they would like to start opening up some of their theaters. Then of course, there\u2019s a chance that they\u2019ll might come back and ask for more different grants. But that\u2019s the way we are currently. And this is an analysis that we are doing on a month to month basis, which is primarily the reason why we took the $8.5 million of write-off for the second quarter. So we continue to believe that this is from an industry perspective, the theater business is a sound business, but certainly going forward, if you look at our overall portfolio, we are revisiting in terms of what percentage of our overall portfolio should theaters constitute. Michael Bilerman : But Sumit, don\u2019t you \u2013 it\u2019s Michael Bilerman speaking. You don\u2019t share in the revenues that when I am going to stream the Universal movie in my house, there is a certain percentage of the revenues that this industry is producing that as a landlord to the box you don\u2019t have, right? So doesn\u2019t it ultimately diminish the value of a feed or a box that you own, right? So shouldn\u2019t it have a higher cap rate and lower rent? Just because the revenues that are going to be generated in that box are not what they used to be? Putting aside the whole COVID thing, right? This just \u2013 this goes to the original issue with theaters, which was PVOD was increasing. And now we\u2019ve had a massive change going from 75 to 17 days that nobody expected. Sumit Roy : Yes. And Michael, that might turn out to be exactly the case. And from a theater perspective, I think you\u2019re right. The actual box will potentially be generating less profitability for EMC, the corporate. But here\u2019s the other piece that I want us to contemplate. And listen, these are all pieces that we are putting out and we are trying to run numbers, et cetera. But if you look at the math associated with something that is shown in the theater versus PVOD, even for the studios, the math is not going to pencil if it is PVOD only. The vast majority of their profitability comes from getting that 55% to 60% of revenues that are generated at the theaters. And it is much more for these big blockbuster movies, which tends to be where Hollywood is migrating towards. And I think this arrangement is more for movies that potentially are not quite as popular, its lower budget, how do we continue to maximize the revenue and perhaps PVOD is a better way to maximize that piece of movies that are being generated by studios. And so really, based on the conversations, we\u2019ve had, the idea here is that this is going to allow the studios to become more profitable, but it should also at the very least make theaters at the corporate level. Either home or potentially participate in some upside. And at least, the studios become healthier. They\u2019ll be able to generate better movies and be able to generate big tent movies, and that should translate to better content for the theater industry. But this is a thesis. So I get your concern, Michael. We are following this very closely and we\u2019ll see how all of this plays out. Michael Bilerman : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : This is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Sumit, the guiding level of acquisitions, inclusive or exclusive of any potential portfolio deals. And how do you think about your ability to underwrite those $200 million plus transactions given the number of tenants and leases in this more uncertain environment? Sumit Roy : Yes. So even where we are today, Nick, I think we feel you\u2019re not super excited about our cost of equity, but our overall cost of capital still will allow us to continue to chase transactions that we otherwise believe checks all of the boxes. In terms of the industries, we want to focus on the operators within those industries, we want to be in and the real estate asset type. And that hasn\u2019t changed. What gave us confidence in being able to put out the acquisition numbers was really our pipeline. And the number of inbounds that we started to get over the last two and a half, three months. And the fact that, the volatility that was that we saw earlier on in the quarter, where our stock could move 8%, 9% on a day that seems to have gotten a bit more benign. It gave us the confidence to be able to go out and say, based on the pipeline we\u2019ve created, based on the discussions we having, that we\u2019ll be able to hit that $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion acquisition number. And our ability to do $200 million portfolio deals has not changed and the fact that we are today under leveraged. I think allows us to not have to rely on the most volatile of biggest component of our capital stack, which is equity. We can just lean on the debt side of the equation, it seems to have normalized considerably since the earlier month. And be able to finance our acquisition. So having that optionality is obviously what gave us a confidence to be able to go out with a number that we feel likely to need. Nick Yulico : Okay. So the portfolio deals may be included within the guidance number at this point. Sumit Roy : Absolutely. Sorry. I didn\u2019t answer that directly. That\u2019s correct. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks. Shifting gears a little bit, just given the current presidential polls by looking to go after 1031 exchanges and the tax plan. Would you expect the removal of white kind exchanges to have a measurable impact on the business or maybe the types of assets that you look to acquire? Sumit Roy : I wouldn\u2019t use the word measurable, but yes on the margin, do I expect you to have an impact, absolutely. We don\u2019t necessarily compete with 1031 buyers too much maybe on the quick service restaurant side of the business. We will run into some of these buyers on a one off transaction, but by and large, we are buying portfolios, even smaller portfolio transactions. And we have all of the usual suspects that are not 1031, who play in that market. Then switching over to the disposition market. Most of our dispositions tend to be vacant assets and you don\u2019t see 1031 buyers playing in that particular market. It tends to be developers or tenants who want to own their own space, who tend to play in that particular market. So the only area where we might see them is sending occupied assets on a one off basis. And that doesn\u2019t end to be a big part of our overall portfolio. Nick Yulico : Great. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. In terms of the rent deferrals, you guys granted to tenants so far this year. Has any of the terms changed since first negotiated and/or have any tenants indicated that they would be paying back run ahead of the original payback period? Sumit Roy : Yes, actually \u2013 so I\u2019ll answer your first question. Second part of your question first, Spenser, that\u2019s, okay. We\u2019ve been sharing our monthly collection information pretty much on a monthly basis. And if you recall, when we first came out with April rents we had said it was 82.9% today. It\u2019s tracking at 88.4% for me rented with a similar trend. We originally came up with 82%. Today, it\u2019s at 84.9%. But similarly with June, we were at 85.7% and today it\u2019s at 86.1%. So in each one of these months, what happened was we\u2019ve had some of our tenants who went back and made us home. Some of them were on from the, on the restaurant side of the equation. Some of them were health and fitness businesses, and some were data centers that basically decided to make us hold for the month of April, may and June. So that\u2019s certainly happened where initially we thought we may have to pursue deferment agreements with some of these tenants. And they came back because the business has opened earlier than they expected and/or they felt better about the liquidity situation and decided to make us home. With respect to the first part of your question, Spenser around, did we have to alter the leases, the vast majority of what we have entered into, which is that $14 million worth of rent of the total $16 million that we entered into an agreement has been done without having to make amendments to the lease itself to the original lease term. And so that is the main reason why, we are being able to stay within the accounting rules to view these as different rents. So we haven\u2019t had to sort of request a longer duration or a payback, et cetera. We expect to be paid back during the original lease term, and therefore we didn\u2019t have to enter into any of lease modification. And that is a similar story on the remaining $46 million that we have entered into discussions with. Now around the edges, there have been some tenants where they requested a longer payback period, which went beyond the original lease term. And those have obviously been \u2013 they are not part of the deferred rent agreements, which didn\u2019t result in a lease amendment. And so \u2013 but that\u2019s a very, very small percentage. The vast majority has been with \u2013 without having to make amendments to the lease itself. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Thanks. Sumit, if I heard you right, it sounds like you walked away from a portfolio transaction in the quarter. Just if I heard that right, just getting a sense of maybe what the cap rate was on that to see how low is too low for you guys? And maybe what the investment spread, just wasn\u2019t there. Sumit Roy : Yes. Todd. Actually, there were a couple of transactions there in the $650 million that I talked about. Both were international and they were both products that we would have absolutely love to have owned. I don\u2019t want to speak to the specific cap rates because these are fairly large transactions. And if you do some amount of research, you\u2019ll be able to figure them out. And one\u2019s not public yet. So \u2013 but what I will say is if you look at, I\u2019ll answer your question slightly differently, Todd, if you look at the spreads we are making, we made about $135 million \u2013 135 basis points of spreads, which was 15 basis points inside of our average spread that we\u2019ve made in the history of our acquisitions. And so the point I want to make is, yes, we are willing to make smaller spread, but not to a point, which does not justify day one having enough of a positive uplift from these investments and take into account some of the risks that are inherent in these investments, though, if you look at the industry, you look at the operator, these are the types of businesses and operators that you feel a very high level of confidence that not only will they make it through the initial lease term, but will continue to operate these businesses post their initial lease term, and these lease terms tend to be 15 years to 20 years. So \u2013 but we have \u2013 we\u2019ve done up to 131 of basis point spread. So we are certainly willing to go south of what our average spread has been, but there is a point beyond which we won\u2019t go. Todd Stender : Got it, okay. Thank you. And I\u2019m not sure if I missed this, but just looking at the \u2013 when we look at the same-store revenue growth, quick service restaurants is what created the biggest hit. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that, but maybe casual dining to that degree, but maybe just flesh out what happened there within QSR? Sumit Roy : Sure. So there are a couple of operators that constituted the biggest chunk of that write-off. One\u2019s NPC that filed BK. And another one is continuing to pay rent, but it\u2019s just one that we feel we don\u2019t have the same level of confidence. And this is a name that has been on our watch list for over a year now. And in fact, they did end up paying July rent. But nevertheless, we feel like our level of confidence doesn\u2019t quite meet that 75% collectibility threshold, and so we decided to write those off. And so that\u2019s \u2013 those are the two names that constitute the QSR piece of the write-off. Todd Stender : Okay, thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. John Massocca : Yes. So apologies if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but as you look into July, how much of the uncollected rent was deferred and how much was kind of not subject to an agreement? And are there any industries that are driving this portion and was it deferred? Sumit Roy : Yes. We did not share with you, John, what the results are for July in terms of our negotiation. What I have shared with you is of the 86.5% that we collected for the second quarter, i.e. the 13.5% that remained uncollected, 9% of that is basically that $46.2 million that we\u2019ve shared with you in terms of rent that we are in the midst of negotiating. There isn\u2019t an agreement in place. $14.1 million or approximately 3% are our negotiations that have completed or are very close to being penciled. And then the remaining 1.3% of that 13.5% uncollected was written off. So that\u2019s the \u2013 those are the three buckets of that 13.5% that we didn\u2019t collect for the second quarter. We haven\u2019t shared for the month of July, the 8.5% of uncollected, what\u2019s the breakup there. But those numbers, obviously, the \u2013 what was being negotiated, that number has reduced because some of those negotiations have gotten over the finish line. But we will bring those \u2013 we will share that information at a later date. John Massocca : Okay. And then I guess this question could go towards your overall portfolio, maybe even specifically with regards to health and fitness. Have you seen any operators do that and concerned about increased commercial restrictions that came into place as you kind of saw regional pandemic spikes in July? And I guess, do you have any kind of initial take on how that may or may not impact August rent collection? Sumit Roy : Yes. Look, thankfully, all of this was playing out in the month of July. How people felt at the beginning of July was very different from the end of July when the contraction rates have started to go up and were very concentrated in the small states, in Texas, in Florida, in Arizona, California. And clearly, there was, if not a slowing down, there was even potentially an unwinding of the openings. But outside of California where health and fitness were asked to reclose, Florida, Texas, they continue to basically just have the restrictive \u2013 the restrictions in place in terms of the number of potential members who could be visiting the clubs, et cetera, to stay in place. And where they unwinded were on the \u2013 more on the bars and beaches and things like that. And while all of this was playing out, we were in negotiations with one of our two largest health and fitness clients and we are close to an agreement with one of them. And the other largest operator has continued to pay rent throughout the pandemic to us. So look, does that mean that they may not come back to us and talk to us if the slowdown occurs or if there is an unwinding of some of the openings? Yes, that\u2019s a possibility. But it was happening real time. And at least as of today, we have not heard back from this particular operator. So \u2013 and by the way, they ended up paying July rent. So that\u2019s part of the reason why our collections in July has been as high as it has of 91.5%. John Massocca : And just a quick point of clarification, the tenant that you\u2019re negotiating with pay the July rent, not the ones who have paid rent through the entire period of 2Q and July? Sumit Roy : Right. So we \u2013 of the two largest operators that part of our top 20. One has paid us rent all through. And the other one ended up paying July rent. John Massocca : Okay, very helpful. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey there, most of mine have been asked, but I wanted to get some clarification on something you mentioned earlier. You mentioned that some tenants paid partial rents. Can you talk about some of the tenants or maybe the industry that you\u2019ve moved to partial rents beyond, say, the movies? And do you also have tenants you\u2019ve moved to percentage rents and/or have abated rent for you yet? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Sure, Haendel. Look, I think most of the negotiations on the deferred part of the equation was around us independently verifying the liquidity situation for some of these tenants and whether or not they were open, what was their balance sheet strength and their ability to pay and that is sort of how \u2013 and in speaking with them, we have concluded as to whether there needs to be some sort of a deferment or not. And then what shape is that deferment going to take? Should we have then pay partial rent for the next few months? Should we have them pay 100% of the rent for the next few months, but make us hold on the previous three months where we may not have collected any rent? All of that has been on a case-by-case basis, Haendel. And so with the \u2013 if you think about our portfolio and you look at the industries that have been most impacted by this COVID-19 induced pandemic, it\u2019s the ones we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s the theater business, it\u2019s the health and fitness business, it\u2019s daycare to some extent and the restaurant business. And they all have a different profile attached to them. If you look at the theaters, we have almost 100% of our theaters close today with the expectation that they will start opening up in August 20 for EMC and August 21 for Regal. But that, again, is subject to change if things don\u2019t improve. If you look at the day care business, most of the day care business has either been \u2013 has been partially open. Because they still continue to have restrictions in terms of the number of what percentage of occupancy they can hit. Then you look at the health and fitness business, a lot of the health and fitness business is open, either fully open or partially open. But even these occupancy numbers of \u2013 you can\u2019t have more than 30% occupancy does not impact the health and fitness business as much as it impacts some of these other businesses because they tend to run at 30% occupancy anyway. So when you take all of that into account, then you create a profile of who can pay what rent. And that leads to the types of agreements that we\u2019ve entered into, which translates to that 91.5% collection for the month of July. And so the remaining piece that hasn\u2019t been collected, what shape is that going to take? Are some of them going to start paying partial rent in the coming months? That is the expectation. But I remain cautious because it is all subject to what we see happening with the contraction rates and the mortality rates. And as long as they are stable to contain, I think we are going to be okay. But if it continues to get worse, and there is a chance that we may see some of these shutdowns reoccur and some of these discussions revisited. Haendel St. Juste: Certainly, certainly. Appreciate that. And I have one more. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it earlier, I\u2019ve been in and off this call with power outages here, but did you talk about your inclination to invest oversea here and Europe. You talked about Canada in the past. Last year, that was, I believe, nearly half of your investment volumes. So curious on what your appetite here is how you perceive that risk? Or perhaps could we see the bulk of your investments be more domestic? Thank you. Sumit Roy : Yes. Haendel, the vast majority of our investments, even last year, was here in the U.S. We had about $800 million of the $3.7 billion that we did, was in the UK market. This year, the mix is 1/3, 2/3. So 2/3 of it has been here in the U.S. and 1/3 has been in the UK, and we expect that mix to play out over the remainder. But when we first entered into the UK markets, what we had shared with the market at that time was that 25% of our acquisitions we thought was going to be in the UK and 75% was going to continue to be here in the U.S. And that has shifted slightly to 1/3, 2/3. And I expect it\u2019s going to be in between those two numbers for the remainder of the year. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan. Anthony Paolone : Thank you. So you have 12% of your revenue that you\u2019re either negotiating or you\u2019re done with the deferral agreement. So just trying to understand if everything plays out the way these are being drafted or have been written, what is \u2013 what do collections look like come, say, 1Q or 2Q 2021? Is it 92%? Is it 98%? Just trying to understand the cadence of this returning to par, so to speak. Sumit Roy : Look, the first metric I\u2019m focused on, Anthony, is to see, can we start collecting 100% of what\u2019s owed to us. And the good news here is that at least we are trending in that direction with every month that has gone by. And the second element of the good news that I\u2019ve seen is, not only are we trending upwards in terms of what is owed for a given month, but some of these tenants have gone back and paid us on rents that they didn\u2019t pay in the months of April, May and June. And so that continues to give us confidence that, at least they are feeling confident enough to pay us back rents that we hadn\u2019t even agreed to in terms of a deferment agreement. But I want to put all of that in context here. Look, if the COVID-19 situation continues to deteriorate, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that some of these guys would come back and talk to us and say, \"Hey, sorry, we have to pause again because all of our stores have been shut down again.\" But as long as that doesn\u2019t happen or that doesn\u2019t happen in scale, then I think these trends are going to continue. And the first thing I\u2019m going to be trying to look for is when are we reaching that 100% of the old rents for a given month, when are we getting that 100% collection? And as soon as we get that, then we start to focus on, okay, all the deferred amounts and the agreements that we have put in place, are they starting to pay back portions of it? Because if you look at the vast majority of the agreements that are already in place, most of the payback is 4.5 months, 4.7 months. Sorry, 4.5 months of deferred rent and the payback is within a 12-month period. So portions of it need to start getting paid back over the next few months. And so if we start to see them paying their monthly rent plus some of the deferred rent, that\u2019s when I know we are back to normal. And the rest of it is all noise as far as I can see. I mean, look, it\u2019s important to see what is happening in each state and all of that, but ultimately, it needs to translate to our operators being able to run their businesses and feel confident enough to make the call. Anthony Paolone : Okay, thank you. And then second question is on 7-Eleven, I think second largest tenant. Just given what they announced earlier in the week, can you just comment on your appetite for having substantially more exposure to, say, one tenant and balancing that against perhaps being like a very good credit, which has served you well right now. Sumit Roy : Yes. So Anthony, look, we like the convenience store business. It is the industry that we have \u2013 to be 12% of our overall portfolio is convenience stores right now. And within that, we are very grateful to have a very good relationship with 7-Eleven. And the fact that they were able to buy another tenant of ours, which is Speedway, is a good thing in my mind. They\u2019re consolidating the industry. I was going through their investor presentation yesterday, and it\u2019s got some very interesting statistics, some of which continues to reconfirm what a good operator they are and some of the synergies that they can create. Having said that, we want to be mindful of being able to run a very prudent portfolio. And \u2013 but not every tenant and not every industry is created equal. If there is an industry and there is a particular operator that we would make exceptions for, it is absolutely 7-Eleven and it is absolutely the convenience store business. But we can\u2019t let convenience store dominate 40% of our portfolio and nor can we let a single-tenant dominate a big chunk of our register on a permanent basis. But are we willing to help support some of our clients with whom we\u2019ve had an amazing relationship and we believe in the industry and we believe in a particular tenant? The answer is yes. So this is like one of our \u2013 my colleagues told us. This is the [risk on detail] for Realty Income to be able to go out and do these very large-scale transactions and be able to help our clients and at the same time, create a portfolio that continues to become incredibly strong. And so these are the opportunities that we were hoping to have discussions around them. Yes, if it presents itself and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be all $5 billion sale-leaseback that they have identified. But if it\u2019s portions of it, we\u2019d be happy to engage in that. Anthony Paolone : Great. Thank you for the color. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : Thank you for taking my questions. I just had one. Understanding is a function of acquisition mix and capital costs. How do you see the 131 basis points investment spread you generated this quarter? And how does that trend in the forthcoming quarters? Sumit Roy : Linda, you were breaking up, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but I think your question was around the spreads that we achieved in the second quarter and how do we see it going forward? Is that right? Linda Tsai : Yes, that\u2019s right. Sumit Roy : Okay. Yes. So look, the \u2013 our cost of capital in the second quarter was obviously impacted by what happened to the cost of equity during the three months, where we were in the midst of the COVID-19 situation. And the fact that our stated spread was 131 basis points. It\u2019s largely being driven by 2/3 of the equity piece, being priced reflective of where we were trading in these three months. And the question of if our cost of equity is where it is today or continues to improve from where it is today, those spreads should improve. Because the product that we are seeing is very much along the lines of what we have done in the first half. There\u2019s just a lot more of it. And so our expectation is that our spreads will improve. Our expectation is that our overall cost of capital will improve. But the fact that we have optionality to not lean on one particular source of capital versus the other, I think just gives us more optionality in terms of how do we permanently finance our transaction? And then what ultimately turns out to be the permanent spread that we are able to trap? I think that is left to be seen, but the expectation is that it should continue to improve going forward. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : And this concludes the Q&A portion of Realty\u2019s Income conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today, and we\u2019ll keep everyone updated on the business going forward. Thank you, Keisha, for orchestrating this call. We really appreciate it.",

Andrew Crum : Thank you, all, for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Capital Markets and Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you'd like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. As we remain in a remote work environment to promote the safety of our employees and community, I continue to be impressed by the resiliency and talent of our team to drive our business forward through the current pandemic. I also remain appreciative of the support and resiliency of our clients and partners, who continue to perform under difficult circumstances. On the personnel front, we were excited to announce that Christie Kelly has been appointed Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. And we look forward to Christie joining us in January. Christie's depth and breadth of experience with leading real estate companies will be immediately additive to our team. Over the last year she has been a valuable member of our Board of Directors and the Board's Audit Committee, which will further promote a smooth transition. I look forward to partnering with Christie to continue advancing Realty Income's strategy and objectives. Moving on to a summary of the quarter. During the third quarter we invested approximately $659 million in high-quality real estate including $230 million in the UK, which brings us to nearly $1.3 billion invested year-to-date. Investments during the quarter were primarily concentrated in the home improvement, convenience store and grocery store industries, each of which continue to perform well through the current environment. On October 1, we diversified our access and presence in the global capital markets as we closed on our debut public debt issuance of Sterling-denominated notes, raising \u00a3400 million in 10-year notes, with an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. We are grateful for the support we received from the UK fixed income investors community, and we look forward to building on these relationships in the years to come. We took steps to further position our balance sheet for growth during the quarter, as we raised approximately $349 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio at quarter end was 5.3 times, which is well within our target leverage ratio, and provides a significant financial flexibility moving forward. Based on the strength of our investment pipeline and our continued access to well priced capital, we're increasing 2020 acquisitions guidance to approximately $2 billion. Moving on to investment activity during the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $659 million in 89 properties located in 21 states in the United Kingdom, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4%, and with a weighted average lease term of 12.7 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 73% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment grade rated tenants or their subsidiaries. Of the $659 million invested during the quarter, $429 million was invested domestically in 82 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9%, and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. During the quarter, $230 million was invested internationally in seven properties located in the UK, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 7.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 8.9 years. Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $1.3 billion in 180 properties located in 28 States and the UK, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.1 years. On a revenue basis, 56% of total acquisitions are from investment grade rated tenants or their subsidiaries. Of the $1.3 billion invested year-to-date $845 million was invested domestically in 167 properties, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. Year-to-date approximately $454 million was invested internationally in 13 properties located in the UK, at weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 10 years. Transaction flow remains healthy, as we sourced approximately $14.1 billion in the third quarter. Of this amount, $10 billion was domestic opportunities and $4.1 billion were international opportunities. Of the opportunity source during the third quarter, 53% were portfolios and 47% or approximately $6.7 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date we sourced approximately $46.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of the $659 million in total acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 44% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 164 basis points for domestic investments, and 328 basis points for international investments. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline remains robust, and we are well-positioned with strong financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities going forward, resulting in our increased acquisition guidance. Moving to dispositions, during the quarter we sold 36 properties for net proceeds of $50 million, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 19.7%. This brings us to 65 properties sold year-to-date for $183.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6%. And we realized an unlevered IRR of 13.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 tenants in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. Approximately 85% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at over 10% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.8% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments, and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio, with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior quarter. During the quarter, we re-leased 80 properties recapturing 99.2% of the expiring rent year-to-date - sorry, year-to-date, we re-leased 238 properties, recapturing 99.8% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable. During the third quarter we collected 93.1% of contractual rent due, and we collected 92.9% of contractual rent for the month of October. Further improvements in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent on improvements in the theatre industry, which I will touch on shortly. Our collection rates are calculated as the cash rent collected, divided by the contractual rent charge for the applicable period. Charge amounts have not been adjusted for any COVID-19 related rent relief granted, and do include contractual base rents from any tenants and bankruptcies. We collected 100% of contractual rent for the third quarter from investment grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of high-quality real estate portfolio leased to large well-capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment grade rated tenants as a primary objective, during periods of economic uncertainty, high grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last three quarters have proven out. Our top four industries, convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent approximately 37% of rental revenue. And we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater and health and fitness industries, as these industries account for approximately 80% of uncollected rents during the third quarter. As we continue to manage our portfolio to support long-term value creation, we believe the breadth and depth of our asset management and real estate operations department, which is our company's largest department is a key competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors. I would also like to update the investment community on our latest views on the theater industry. The industry represents 5.7% of our contractual base rent. And while we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post-pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies. As a reminder, U.S. Box Office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all time an Avengers : Endgame. Further, recent reports from China where over 80% of movie theaters are open, show that daily box office revenue has recovered to 2019 levels. Though we acknowledge that cultural nuances do influence theater attendance, it remains a relevant data point. We continue to believe particularly for blockbuster movies, that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics afforded to them versus the streaming platform. That said, we do recognize that the industry is changing, and that there will likely be a rationalization of theatres in a post-pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theatres may not survive. Near-term, there are several uncertainties facing the industry particularly around, when the major movie studios will feel comfortable releasing their films through the theatrical distribution channel. And with theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, the two largest markets in the U.S. remaining shuttered, we like others who follow the industry lack clarity as to whether studios will be inclined to release blockbuster films. As a result, our confidence level associated with the collectability of a portion of our outstanding theater receivables has diminished, and the near-term solvency risk facing the two largest operators in the space, AMC and Cineworld is incrementally more pronounced. To that end, we believe it is prudent to establish a full reserve for the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 78 total theater assets, and to move to cash accounting for revenue recognition purposes, for these 37 assets going forward. We deemed the collectability of rents for these 37 theater assets to be less than probable, based on a variety of factors including the store level performance of these assets. To be clear, we believe our theater portfolio is one of very high-quality, and we estimate that 82% of theatres in our portfolio are in the top two quartile of each operator's portfolio in terms of store level performance. Specifically, of the 72 theater assets that we have recent unit level financial information on, we estimate that 41 are in the top quartile, 18 are in the second quartile, 11 are in the third quartile, and two are in the bottom quartile, based on pre-pandemic EBITDAR performance. Our criteria to determine which of these assets to move to cash accounting was predicated on a holistic approach, based largely on these productivity rankings on a pre-rent and post-rent basis. We determined that 31 of these assets most of which were still profitable based on pre-pandemic financials, generated EBITDA that prevented us from deeming collection as probable. Of the remaining six assets for which we are reserving, we did not have access to unit level financial information to assess collectability. Thus, as a conservative measure, we reserve for those six assets as well. The financial impact of our theater reserves is $17.2 million of reserves recognized for these 37 assets, $1.6 million of which is straight line rent receivable reserve, and thus has no AFFO impact. The third quarter impact is approximately $0.04 per share diluted to AFFO, and $0.05 per share diluted to FFO. And going forward, we will not accrue revenue on these assets unless we actually collect the cash rent, all we determine collectability has become probable again. During the quarter, we recorded provisions for impairment of approximately $105 million, $79 million of which was associated with 12 theater assets. To arrive at the appropriate impairment for our theater assets, we analyzed the same 37 assets where collection probability was deemed less than probable. Of the 37 assets we analyzed, we determined that 12 assets had a probability weighted undiscounted cash flow that was less than the current net book value of the assets. Accordingly, we impaired the carrying value of these 12 assets down to their estimated fair value. As a reminder, provisions for impairment only impact net income and has no impact on the company's FFO or AFFO. Now I'd like to outline our current thoughts on the long-term outlook for our overall portfolio revenue stream, almost all of which we expect to remain intact in a post-pandemic world. As discussed, we do expect a level of rationalization in the overall theatre industry, which may require repositioning some of our properties. The theaters most likely to be impacted going forward would be a subset of the 37 properties, which we have moved to cash accounting, which in total represent $33.3 million of annual rent, or 2% of our annual rent. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer-term, even in the event of potential closures. Beyond the theatre industry, we continue to monitor select tenants in the health and fitness and restaurant industries in particular. Though the overall diversity credit and real estate quality of our portfolio gives us comfort that any longer-term rent loss would be fairly modest. Moving on, our same-store rental revenue decreased 4.4% during the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but similarly excludes rent where collectability is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognize in the theatre industry, and to a lesser extent the health and fitness industry. I will provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue for the quarter was 4.3%. Our year-to-date G&A expense ratio excluding approximately $3.5 million of severance related to the departure of our former CFO was 4.5%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, reflecting our best in class efficiency and the scale benefits afforded to us given our size. Our non-reimbursable property expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue was 1.9% for the quarter, and 1.5% year-to-date. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.81, and $2.55 year-to-date. Our AFFO per share for the quarter was negatively impacted by the recording of non-straight line rent reserves of approximately $21.8 million during the quarter, which represented $0.06 per share of dilution. Year-to-date our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight line rent reserves of approximately $29.3 million, which represents $0.09 per share of dilution. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least two A ratings. During the quarter we issued $315 million of notes due 2031 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 2.34%, and subsequent to quarter end, we completed a debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured notes for \u00a3400 million due 2030, for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. Additionally, we raised approximately $349 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. Year-to-date, we have raised nearly $2.7 billion of well-priced capital, including approximately $1.22 billion of equity, and $1.47 billion of debt. We ended the quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with net debt to adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 5.3 times, or 5.2 times on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains strong at 5.2 times. We continue to have very minimal net short-term borrowing, as $856 million outstanding on the line and through our CP program was largely offset with approximately $725 million of cash on hand. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with less than $80 million of debt maturities through yearend 2021, excluding CP borrowings. And the weighted average maturity of our bonds is a healthy 8.2 years. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape, and we continue to have no leverage, strong coverage metrics and ample liquidity. In September, we increased the dividend for the 108th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.5%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 dividend aristocrat's index for having increased their dividend every year, for the last 25 consecutive years. In summary, we are confident in the overall resiliency of our portfolio, and believe our strategy of partnering with large, well-capitalized operators who are leaders in their respective industries will continue to be a successful strategy. The momentum in our investment pipeline, our ample sources of liquidity, and our size and scale position as favorably to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett from Berenberg. Your line is now open. Nate Crossett : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe you could just characterize the deal flow heading into the end of the year. Guidance implies a further ramp into 4Q. So, some more color there would be helpful. Where's that weighted in terms of geographies, concepts? Are there any portfolios in there? And then comments on pricing would be helpful? Sumit Roy : Sure. There's a bunch of questions in there, Nate. So, I'll try to take it one at a time. Look, I think during the second quarter earnings announcement, I had suggested that the pipeline was building up very strong, the sourcing data was incredibly high. And that momentum has continued in the third quarter based on almost $14.5 billion of sourcing. The good news with regards to this sourcing number is that it is fairly well distributed across geographies. I would say $10 billion or two-thirds of it was U.S., one-third is UK. And that mix has been fairly consistent throughout the year of the $47 billion odd that we've sourced. With regards to the product that we are pursuing and what the cap rate environment looks like. It is largely in what will be deemed as essential retail. So grocery stores, home improvement, convenience stores, dollar stores, there continues to be enough product within those sectors, that's keeping us busy. And again, especially on the grocery side, as well as to a lesser extent on the home improvement side, we continue to see both those industries very well represented in the UK. You talked about cap rates or pricing was a specific question. Look, we continue to see pricing cap rates compress, both here in the U.S. as well as in the UK. And this is across asset types, both on the industrial single tenant industrial side, as well as the high-quality retail assets that we are targeting and pursuing. I would say that investment grade rated retail today in the U.S. is in the low 5s to potentially even a four handle for certain assets. And it very rarely gets above a six cap. If you start to look beyond investment grade, yes, you will get in the low 5s to potentially in the low 7s. But there is very few products that we are pursuing that has a seven handle in front of it. And in the UK, the pricing is even more competitive. Especially on the grocery side, you'll find product on the retail side of the equation in the low to sort of 4.2% 4.3% zip code to the mid-5. On the single tenant industrial side across both the U.S. and UK cap rates have compressed, very good product with tenants that we would like to partner with, with long-term leases are trading in the low 4s. So it is a very expensive market. But this is where relationships and previous relationships with tenants and brokers and the folks that control some of the transactions, the developers et cetera that really comes to the forefront. And we feel very good about the pipeline that we've built. It's part of the reason why we were sitting on some cash in recognition of being able to finance right off of our balance sheet. Nate Crossett : Okay, that's all very helpful. Thank you. Just quickly, if we go back into a lockdown, and I guess UK is going into a lockdown this week. What's the impact that you see on the pipeline? Is it different time around I guess is the question? Sumit Roy : Yes, so I'll answer your UK question first, Nate. Again, what they are shutting down tends to be gyms, movie theaters, casual dining concepts, bars, et cetera. And we have no exposure to any of those industries, say for one theater in the UK. Most of our exposure happens to be in the grocery side of the business, and more recently, in the home improvement side of the business, which is deemed as essential retail and will continue to remain open. And these are the precise industries that have actually experienced tailwinds during this pandemic, because of some of the social distancing and stay at home norms that have been adopted by the consumer base. So, we feel pretty good about our portfolio and its ability to perform in the event of a prolonged shutdown in the UK. Here in the U.S., we've also sort of very much bookended where the risk lies, and it is primarily in the theater business, and that's the reason why we spend so much of the time discussing our thesis and walking you through why we've done what we've done in the theater side of the business. Outside of the theater business, its health and fitness to a lesser extent. And the issue of being able to continue to operate a fitness center at 50% capacity is not an issue in and of itself, because most of the time at the peak capacity levels, they rarely go above that 50%, 55% to begin with. And again, given our main two exposures in the health and fitness businesses to the Lifetime and LA Fitness, they continue to be largely open at this point. And I think in the month of October, we collected 83% of the rent. So, we feel that at least with this particular industry, we bookended the risk fairly well. But, look, if we go into a big shut down, I do think that, some of the other industries that were impacted casual dining, Daycare Centers, et cetera, they are much better equipped to handle a prolonged shutdown today than they were in the month of April. And we feel better about their ability to continue to use some of the avenues that they've created, i.e. click and collect, drive-thru, et cetera, as a method to continue to operate their businesses in a way where they can continue to pay us rent. So, the industry that I feel that is going to be - and it continues to be impacted is the theater industry. But outside of that, I think we feel pretty good about the operators we are exposed to in some of these other industries that that could be impacted. But we feel like they'll fare much better this time around than they did in April. Nate Crossett : Okay, thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell from Citi. Your line is now open. Katy McConnell : Okay, great. Thanks. Can you provide some color on the portion of larger portfolio deals completed this quarter, as far as pricing and tenant credit for those? And any other opportunities like that, that you're looking at today they've done market construction? Sumit Roy : Yes. Sure, Katie. Look 55% of what we closed were portfolio deals in the third quarter. So, we continue to see a very healthy flow of portfolio transactions. And truth be told, that's what moves the needle for us, especially on the retail side of the equation. But the comment around cap rates continues to be true Katie, even portfolios are trading at more aggressive cap rates than they were six months ago. And we closed on a transaction in the third quarter with a client that we have a very good relationship with, and the cap rate we ended up paying on that particular portfolio was 20 basis points inside of where we did the previous sale leaseback with them on. And then subsequent to that, we've seen cap rates compress even further. And so yes, we have seen a very healthy pipeline of portfolio transactions and some staggeringly large portfolios are out there in the market. And it's public, in terms of, what they are. And so that's a very good situation for a company like ours, where we have the ability to write, do much larger transactions without running into concentration issues, and especially if it is with a relationship client and that has not abated. And it's not just a phenomenon that we're seeing here in the in the U.S. We are seeing portfolio transactions in the UK as well. And in fact, we ended up closing on a portion of a portfolio transaction that we did with one of our very good relationships in the UK in the third quarter as well. And so the momentum that we've been able to generate both here in the U.S. and the UK continues to be very strong. And that's what gives us the confidence of having increased our guidance by $500 million at the midpoint of our previous acquisition guidance. Katy McConnell : Thanks for the color. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you talk about the progress you've made so far in the held for sale assets? And what you're seeing so far, regarding pricing indication? And do you expect a royalty of rent in the industry volume next year to sell down more of your high-risk exposure outside of figures? Sumit Roy : Absolutely, Katie. I mean, we are already up to $186 million. And I think you can expect a similar run rate in the fourth quarter, which will be one of the larger disposition strategies that we've had or disposition amounts that we've had in the recent past. And the commentary on cap rates continues to be true on the disposition side of the equation as well. So of course, these are assets that no longer strategically fit the profile of our optimal portfolio, but there continues to be a market for it. And that's the reason why we were able to achieve such high double digit, high teen type unlevered IRRs, because the market is very conducive to sell into. And we will continue to do that going forward. But again, it's a story of two baskets, if you will. There's definitely a very healthy appetite for all of the industries that I've talked about as being essential retail, and cap rates are incredibly aggressive in that particular bucket. But if you look at assets in the health and fitness business, or if you look at assets in the theater business, there is no market right now. So, yes, we can continue to call our portfolio and evolve towards our optimal portfolio. But it's not a market where you can sell, essentially, any asset that you have, or you desire to sell. So, I think we have to take that into consideration as well. Katy McConnell : Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Spenser Allaway from Green Street. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, thank you. This is Harsh, filling in for Spenser. Could you talk a little bit about your disposition activity, just building on that sort of the tenant or industry, or the particular geography that you're looking to exit from, which may not be strategically fitting with your portfolio rate? Sumit Roy : Yes. So Harsh, I think, in trying to answer Katy's question, I talked about the volume, but I'll get a bit more specific. The assets that we are selling are, there was some grocery assets that we sold with operators that we didn't seem like fit our profile for the long-term, and we're able to get very aggressive pricing. All of the assets sold were here in the U.S. So I just want to make that point very clear. And then there were some assets that we've sold on the convenience store side of the business. And these tend to be formats, that, again, is not what we would be pursuing actively. So these are more like kiosks, 1,500 square feet boxes, with half an acre, with potentially tenants that don't quite have the credit profile that we would like to have long-term, there continues to be a market for those types of products and so we're selling those assets. And then of course, we sell a lot of vacant assets as well in this market. And despite the fact that we are in the midst of a pandemic there continues to be especially for well-located vacant assets, there continues to be an appetite amongst the developer community to come in and buy those fairly aggressively. And so that's the makeup of some of the assets that we've been selling. And another industry that I would throw in there is the restaurant business. So some of the assets that we've sold, happened to be in the restaurant business. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And just talking about theater again. How many of the 37 theaters that forbids collection were deemed less than probable? I have leases that are expiring in the next two years. And then on that where that would impaired? Can you provide some more color on them, like the tenants they were leased to or geographies they were in, like within major city center or something like that? Sumit Roy : Sure. So, the way we sort of went through the analysis, I think I went through it in a fair amount of detail, but I'll just be brief. On the 31 of the 37 assets, they happen to be two of them were in the top quartile of performance, 16 were in the second quartile, 11 in the third quartile, and two in the fourth quartile. And then there were six assets for which we didn't have financial information. And so that's the 37 assets that we deemed, as being ones that in a conservative scenario, if there was going to be rationalization in the theatre business, we couldn't say with a high probability of a collection that we'll be able to collect rent, and so we move them to cash accounting. Of those 37 assets, we did the impairment analysis, because anytime we move to cash accounting that's a trigger for impairment. 12 of those assets were deemed as being impaired. And there are several analyses that we go through when you compare the undiscounted cash flow to the net book value, and if it's less than the net book value, we take an impairment. And so those 12 assets resulted in $79 million of the $105 million of impairment. And then there was another asset that we had an office asset that resulted in about $18 million of impairment. And then that basically constituted the vast majority of the $105 million. The lease terms remaining on the portfolio on the entire theater industry, I think it's in the high single digits for both Regal as well as AMC. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful. Thank you so much. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Greg McGinniss : Hey Sumit. The average investment size in UK this year, it's over $30 million a property versus the $5.5 million in the U.S., which I imagine is just a function of focusing on grocery store acquisitions in the UK. And I'm curious is that the trend we should expect to continue regarding larger average asset size in UK index universal property types available or meeting your underwriting standards is more limited than in the U.S.? Sumit Roy : That's a very good observation, Greg. And because we have very tightly defined parameters for what we are going to pursue in the UK, they tend to fall in one of two buckets, it's either going to be and mostly it's going to be in the grocery side of the equation, or it's going to be home improvement. And those boxes tend to be larger, and they tend to be very well located, they tend to be located in high demographic regions. And they have a price point of right around $30 million to $45 million apart. And then when you supplement that with industrial assets that we are also pursuing, again, very rigid standards. Those will tend to be even higher than that, 2x that in some cases. So that's the product mix that you're going to find us pursuing in the UK. And that's the reason why those price per property points in the UK are going to be much larger. Here in the U.S., obviously, we go after a lot of discrete quick service restaurants, et cetera, which could trade at $1.5 million per part. And so on average the $4 million to $5 million is the average per property that you find here in the U.S., but that's what drives the differences. Greg McGinniss : Thanks. And then shifting gears thinking about industrial acquisitions. Now, I know you mentioned that cost of capital is an issue regarding execution. There are a couple peers in the net lease space that appear to be maybe somewhat more successful at closing industrial and like manufacturing deals this year, one of which focuses on sale leaseback in the space and another that's trying to make inroads. Are these deals that you're seeing and turning down? Or am I just kind of off the mark here on this comparison because we prefer a different asset or tenant space? Any new case and cover on why you may or may not be pursuing or sourcing certain deals will be appreciated? Sumit Roy : Sure. And look, I don't want to speak to what our competitors are doing, Greg. But the assets that we are pursuing, with the operators that we are pursuing on the industrial side, yes, we have come across mid-6%, high-6% deals, but for a variety of reasons. And it's largely driven by where these assets are located or the tenant and the credit that the tenant has or the type of business that they are involved in. It just doesn't get us comfortable. And so we walk away from those transactions. The ones that we are pursuing, they happen to be in the zip code that I've shared with you with regards to pricing. And so it has been a bit challenging for us. And thankfully, we've got the cost of capital to pursue some not all of these transactions and that's what we're trying to do is be as clinical as we can, leverage the relationships that we have. But in some cases, pricing gets to a point where we just have to walk away. Greg McGinniss : Okay, that's fair. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts from UBS. Your line is now open. Brent Dilts : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first, could you provide some color on how competition in the transaction market has evolved during the pandemic? And I'm specifically looking for maybe like how much capital you're seeing come in from outside the industry, places like private equity, pension funds, et cetera? Sumit Roy : Yes, happy to answer that. At the very beginning, I want to say right around June, et cetera, when we were reengaging, I'll tell you that we were amongst the very few that was still active in the acquisitions market. And we certainly took advantage of that. In some cases, we had transactions that we had sort of suspended, just entering into the pandemic, those came back to us. And we were able to transact some of those at slightly higher cap rates, but very, very quickly that scenario has changed. And it has become far more competitive. Even though some of our public peers have not fully engaged in the acquisitions market, there is plenty of capital chasing product on the retail side, which is where the surprise has been. The industrial has been less surprising to us. Even though, over the last six months, we've seen pricing get fairly aggressive. And there, we do see a lot of international money chasing well located long-term leases. But the biggest surprise for us has been on the retail side. The product that we're chasing, it's not surprising that that should attract the preponderance of capital. And we have seen that, and so that I think is the main reason why cap rates have gotten compressed. And now it's pretty aggressive out there. Brent Dilts : Okay, great. And then just sticking with the transaction market, how has bid-ask spreads changed during the year? And has there been a big variance by tenant industry? Sumit Roy : Well, clearly transactions that are occurring. So, we just raised our guidance to $2 billion, approximately $2 billion. And so, this is obviously a testament to the pipeline that we have, transactions that we've already got over the finish line. I think, there's plenty of transactions that will get done. The fixed income market is obviously incredibly - the cost of capital in the fixed income market is incredibly low right now, it's very competitive. And so this is where, our ratings et cetera come into the forefront because if one-third of the financing is coming from there, our overall cost of capital does allow us to continue to play even though the markets have gotten aggressive. Clearly, there was a period where very, very few transactions were getting done. And this is the month of April, which is when everybody was trying to get their arms around the pandemic, et cetera. But I would say that lasted all of four to six weeks, and immediately after that, transactions got done. And they got done at higher levels in the month of June, July than they are getting down today. Brent Dilts : Great. Thanks, Sumit. Sumit Roy : Yes. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Linda Tsai : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for the detail on the theatres. When you look at the pre-pandemic profitability for the 41 theaters not on cash accounting, what's your base case for how long the recovery takes to approach those prior levels? Sumit Roy : Yes. Linda, that's a great question. And I wish I had an answer for you, I can't share with you that those 41 assets are obviously in the top quartile of performance. They all cleared EBITDA, which is post rent obligations, et cetera, north of $1 million per asset. And so, those were the best of the best assets that either of the two large operators have, that's part of our portfolio. And so, as to when can they get back to those levels, I did share with you that in China, even though they have some constraints in capacity, they're already at pre-pandemic levels. This is largely going to be a function of when the studios feel comfortable, releasing these assets to the theaters, and if they keep pushing the high budget content further in and further out, the further out, it will be when these assets when these theaters can generate that $1 million plus of EBITDAs. And right now this on December 24, we still have the Wonder Woman movie that is still scheduled to come out. The James Bond film got moved out to April of next year. If those start to remain, and if the content that has been pushed out next year does come in next year, and we have a vaccine over the next 60 days and people start to feel more comfortable about being able to go back to the theaters, I can see this rebounding fairly quickly. But the question remains there are so many ifs, right, when will the vaccine come out, when will the customers feel confident of coming back. And we have some data points to point to, we also believe that streaming is not going to be the preferred route for these high budget movies, just because the math doesn't play out. And so I think it really is directly tied to when the studios are going to release the content and the customers feel comfortable in being able to go back, and I think that's going to be a function of when we have a vaccine available. So, if those play out, I think very quickly thereafter, I can see these assets starting to go north of $1 million again. Linda Tsai : Got it. And so are these better positioned theatres on percentage rents right now? Sumit Roy : So a lot of these assets we have basically constructed through sale leasebacks that we entered into with both Regal as well as with AMC. And these were assets that AMC and Regal used to own on their balance sheet. And so they tend to be the better performing assets anyway. And what we have continue to do is to invest, we invested with them when they change the format to accommodate the better seating and the stadium seating and the food and beverage, et cetera. And as part of that, we entered into percentage rent, participation with some of these operators. And so, I don't have the precise number in terms of how many of these assets are on percentage rent, but I do know that, as part of entering into a capital contribution to repurpose some of these assets, we did have percentage rental. Linda Tsai : Thank you. And then just one follow-up. In terms of the subset of the 37 assets that would be up for repositioning. What are some alternative uses? Sumit Roy : Yes, and that's why we continue to be positively surprised, Linda. So, unsolicited, we received some feedback on one of our theater assets where a developer shared with us that it could be positioned to a mixed-use multifamily side, it's very well located. Another one was identified as a potential last mile distribution center, because these tend to be 12, 13 acres parcels and so you could easily create 100,000 square foot last mile distribution center. Now, of course, you have to go through zoning, et cetera. But we feel that, because of where these assets are located, they can be repositioned and we will come out. Okay, it's just a matter of time and commitment and capital commitment. But unsolicited, the feedback we've received so far, because people are all tracking what's happening in the theatre business. We feel that we've come out okay, in the event that we need to position some of these assets. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is now open. John Massocca : Good afternoon. Sumit Roy : Hi, John, how are you? John Massocca : Good. How about yourself? Sumit Roy : Good. John Massocca : Hopefully, it doesn't sound a question. Can you maybe touch on theaters? If an operator went into bankruptcy, would that move all the theaters lease the tenant that was bankrupt? But those theaters that hadn't been put into this kind of cash accounting bucket, would that move them into cash accounting? Essentially, what is the potential for kind of another one-time hit the AFFO something does happen to Cineworld or AMC? Sumit Roy : Yes. Look, if they cease to exist, there is no doubt. They file Chapter 11. Chapter 11 filing in and of itself is not a triggering event. It's just like, what are they planning and doing? What's their path forward? But if it switches over into Chapter 7, then clearly, we're going to write off even the 41 assets that is not on cash accounting, right now, we immediately shift to cash accounting on that. So that's the quick answer on what you just suggested. And that is the reason why we are continuing to monitor AMC came out. I think it was yesterday, maybe we want to raise another $15 million through the ATM program. But this is about what's going to happen first, if they run out of liquidity, and they can't find alternative sources of capital. And this could become a very different kind of discussion. But the question that we keep asking ourselves is, how will the studios that have made the shift to producing these high budget films, they're making fewer films today and 60% of what they are making tends to be this high budget movies? How can they replicate the profitability model that they have through the theatrical distribution channel? We can't see that being replicated in PPOD [ph]. So time will tell, but yes, if situations change, and they do go down the path of filing, then we will have to revisit our analysis. John Massocca : Okay. And then touching on Nate's question from way back earlier in the call, and sorry, if I missed the responses. How does a lockdown a second lockdown in UK potentially impact deal flow? If at all, I mean 2Q UK deal flow fell to little over $50 million. Could that happen again? Or was that moving more reaction to some of the financial market uncertainty and pricing uncertainty rather than structural problems, the closing deals associated with the lockdown? Sumit Roy : The product that we're pursuing there's plenty of product on the grocery side, there is plenty of product on the single tenant industrial side. So there are funds that are going full cycle, they recognize that there's a market for essential retail, those have continued to do well. So we don't see the product that we are actively pursuing, necessarily dry up, because of the Prime Minister shutting down UK again. And I think, I've made the comments already on the industries that are being shut down. We are not pursuing those in the UK. So that does not impact us. And so I think we'd be okay. And it's a similar story here in the U.S. Even in the midst of the previous lockdown, there was product, I think there was this small window where everything was - there was a slight pause in the market, but then very quickly thereafter the product velocity took off and we started getting really busy, getting inbounds and seeing transactions that we wanted to pursue. So I think it'll be similar. And the big difference between now and then is that operators are better prepared, which doesn't mean that they're not going to feel some pain, but they're just better prepared to handle it. Casual dining is better prepared. Daycare centers are better prepared in terms of the operators, certainly quick service restaurants are better prepared. So I think it's going to be different. And unless there's a mandate that none of these facilities will be allowed to remain open, which could happen, but which a small probability of happening, I think these businesses will be okay. John Massocca : But is there a potential shift deal flow from maybe 4Q to 1Q or 1Q '21 to 2Q '21? Sumit Roy : No, actually the 4Q numbers I think are - we are in the beginning of November, it's largely established at this point. So the question will really be if there is some hiccup in the market and sourcing dries up, which again, I want to reiterate, we don't see happening. But if it were to happen, it would probably impact some of first quarter 2021, second quarter 2021. Because you start to build up the portfolio today to close on assets in the first quarter of next year. And so far, so good. John Massocca : Very helpful. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey, Sumit. Hope you're well. I was curious about your strategy on the issuing in Sterling debt market going forward. And why you kind of chose that market through the linked bond [ph] issuance? Sumit Roy : Sure. How are you, Joshua? Joshua Dennerlein : Good, fantastic. Sumit Roy : So I'll tell you, it's very difficult to look at that particular market, when we are buying assets in that market and not match funded with the local currency. For us, it makes perfect sense. And then, obviously, even when we did our first sale leaseback that sort of got us into the UK with Sainsbury's, we try to match fund it with \u00a3300 odd million of local denominated British pounds. And even though we had to go down the 144 path to get there, the reason for doing that was essentially to match fund and not have to worry about trying to enter into cross currency hedges, et cetera, which we did on the remainder. But in doing so we left some economics on the table. And for us, we feel that the product that we are pursuing then has a profile that needs to be warranted with the cost of capital that we can raise there. And we would be a miss if we didn't take advantage of the fact that we have two A credit rating, and we can issue similar tenured paper at potentially 50 basis points, 60 basis points inside of what we can issue here in the U.S. And so our all-in cost was 1.7%. We have assets that have 10-year ship north of 10 years, in fact, on a portfolio basis, it's well north of that. And to be able to match fund it with \u00a3400 million at 1.71% all in costs, that just allows us to create more value for our shareholders. So that was the rationale. Jonathan Pong : Yes. Josh, I would just add. This is Jonathan. This is something that we were looking to do very early in the year and obviously, the pandemic hit. And we were patient, we weighted towards a point in time where the market covered, there's certainly a dearth of supply in the Sterling bond market. Pricing had recovered to a point where on an indicative basis, we're able to execute well inside of where 10-year U.S. paper would have priced. And then obviously, just the diversification of our investor base on the fixed income side and it's very high-quality order book. That was a strategic goal of ours for quite some time going all the way back to 2019, when we first entered the UK market. So it all kind of came together fairly nicely when it did. Joshua Dennerlein : Awesome. I appreciate that guys. I'll leave the floor. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Josh. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Well, thank you everyone for joining us, and I look forward to seeing a lot of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Cree, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020 Operating Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Crum, Associate Director at Reality income. You may begin, sir. Andrew Crum : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter and year-end 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. As we remain in a remote work environment to promote the safety of our employees and community, I continue to be impressed by the resiliency and talent of our team to drive our business forward through the current pandemic. Additionally, I remain appreciative of the support resiliency of our clients and partners who continue to perform under challenging circumstances.  On the personal front, we were excited to welcome Christie Kelly to our management team in January as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and in February, Michele Bechor joined our team as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Secretary.  Mike Pfeiffer, who served as Executive Vice President, Chief Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, will retire after over 30 years of service. Mike will remain serving our company through June 2021 as Chief Administrative Officer and will continue leading our team members as well as assisting Christie and Michelle through their transition at Realty Income until his well-deserved retirement. Words cannot fully reflect Mike's many contributions to our company for over 3 decades, and I'm so immensely grateful for his partnership with me throughout the year.  Moving on to financial matters, including a summary of the quarter and year. During the fourth quarter, we invested over $1 billion in high-quality real estate, including $467 million in the U.K., bringing us to over $2.3 billion invested during 2020, approximately $921 million of which was invested in the U.K. Investments during the year were largely concentrated in the grocery and home improvement industries, both of which continue to thrive during the current economic environment.  We maintained low leverage and ample liquidity throughout the year while enhancing our financial flexibility. Highlights include the establishment of a $1 billion commercial paper program, our successful debut public issuance of sterling denominated unsecured notes and record low coupon rates for 5 years and 12-year dollar-denominated bonds in the REIT sector. We have also been active in the equity capital markets to accretively fund our acquisition pipeline. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we raised approximately $605 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. And in January, we raised an additional $670 million of equity through an overnight offering.  Accordingly, our balance sheet is well positioned to address what continues to be an active investment pipeline. To that end, we are introducing 2021 acquisitions guidance of over $3.25 billion, as we are well positioned to continue the momentum we experienced at the close of last year and in January. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $1 billion in 70 properties located in 22 states and the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.4% with a weighted average lease term of 13.4 years.  On a total revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade rated tenants. 71% of the revenue is generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 31 different tenants in 19 industries. Of the $1 billion invested during the quarter, $541 million was invested domestically in 59 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years.  During the quarter, $467 million was invested internationally in 11 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.7 years. During 2020, we invested over $2.3 billion in 244 properties located in 30 states in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.2 years.  On a revenue basis, 61% of 2020 acquisitions are from investment-grade rated tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 56 different tenants in 26 industries, 2 of the most significant industries represented our grocery and home improvement. Of the $2.3 billion invested during 2020, nearly $1.4 billion was invested domestically in 220 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. And approximately $921 million was invested internationally in 24 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.8 years.  Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we sourced approximately $63.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. The most we have ever reviewed in a given year. Of these opportunities, $42.4 billion were domestic opportunities and $21.2 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 50% of the volumes sourced during the year. Of the $63.6 billion sourced, 56% were portfolios and 44%, approximately, $28.2 billion were one-off assets.  Of the $1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 66% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 130 basis points. Moving to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 60 properties for net proceeds of $77.5 million, realizing an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 125 properties sold during 2020 for $261 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by clients, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At year-end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 clients in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the U.K. Approximately 84% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to that business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce.  These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.9% at year-end. During the fourth quarter, we released 77 properties, recapturing 100.3% of the expiring rents.  During 2020, we re-leased 314 properties, recapturing 100% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. In light of COVID-19, rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable over recent months. During the fourth quarter, we collected 93.6% of contractual rent due and further improvement in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent upon improvements in the theater industry, which I will touch on shortly. We collected 100% of contractual rent for the fourth quarter from investment-grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of our high-quality real estate portfolio, least to large, well-capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade rated tenants as a primary objective. During periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last several quarters have exemplified.  Our Top 4 industries, convenience stores, grocery stores, drug stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent over 37% of rental revenue, and we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater industry, representing approximately 80% of uncollected rent in December. As the theater industry remains challenged, I would like to update the investment community on our latest view. The industry represents 5.6% of our contractual base. While we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies.  You might recall that the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all times in Avengers : Endgame. We continue to believe, particularly for blockbuster movies that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics supported to them versus streaming platforms.  That said, we do acknowledge that the industry is changing and that there likely will be a rationalization of theaters in a post pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theaters may not survive. We continue to maintain a full reserve, the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 77 total theater assets and continue to recognize revenue on a cash basis for these 37 assets.  During the fourth quarter, we established a full reserve for 1 additional theater asset, and we disposed off one theater asset previously on cash accounting. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer term, even in the event of potential closures. As of year-end, the total allowance for these 37 theaters totaled $23.7 million, including $1.8 million of which is a straight-line rent receivable reserve and thus has no AFFO impact.  Moving on. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 3.2% during the quarter and 1.7% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but it excludes rent where collectibility is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognized in the theater industry and to a lesser extent, the health and fitness industry.  Now to provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, I would like to hand it off to Christie. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit, and I'm honored to have joined Realty Income as CFO.. Having joined the Board in 2019, I have experienced firsthand the talent of our Realty Income team, together with the exciting growth opportunities for our business.  I'm looking forward to working together with our teams to deliver our strategic objectives and realization of dreams and aspirations for all at Realty Income with Sumit and our Board of Directors. I also look forward to engaging with our investment community over time. We are grateful for the support of all of our loyal shareholders who have invested in Realty Income for over 26 years as a public company and for our future.  I would now like to provide a general overview of our recent financial results, starting with the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least 2 A ratings. During the quarter, we completed our debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured totes, issuing GBP 400 million due 2030 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. We also issued 725 million of senior unsecured notes in December through a dual tranche offering of 5-year and 12-year notes. Achieving record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. Additionally, we raised approximately $655 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. And in January 2021, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering, which we earmarked to prefund an active investment pipeline to start the year. We ended the year with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remained strong at 5.1x. We ended the year with full availability under our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility. No borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion commercial paper program and over $824 million of cash on hand.  In January, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25 notes due 2022, which was done to reduce our near-term refinancing risk and take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $44 million of debt maturities through year-end 2021, excluding commercial paper borrowings.  Now moving on to our income statement. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.84 and $3.39 per the year on a fully diluted basis, representing annual growth of 2.1%. For 2020, our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight-line rent reserves of $44.1 million, which represents approximately $0.13 per share of dilution, over half of which is attributed to the theater industry.  Now moving on to guidance. As we introduced our initial 2021 earnings estimate, we acknowledge that while some uncertainty related to the theater industry remains together with the backdrop of the pandemic, our confidence in providing guidance is supported by the overall health and stability of our portfolio combined with the acquisition pipeline.  To that end, our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49, represents approximately 1.5% to 3% growth over 2020. Moving on to dividends. In December, we increased the dividend for the 109th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.4%. And we are proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index for having increased our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years.  And now I'd like to hand our call back over to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christie. As we reflect on 2020, we stand behind the overall resiliency of our portfolio. The relentless efforts of our team to add shareholder value and the outlook for our business over the long term. The momentum in our investment pipeline are ample sources of liquidity, and our size and scale positions us favorably to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities around the globe.  At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Maybe just -- congratulations on the new role. Maybe just to start off with the occupancy degradation, as you outlined it. I'm just wondering if you can talk about two things pertaining to that. One, sort of plans to backfill some of that or recapture some of that occupancy loss. And then as we think about kind of '21, what sort of embedded in terms of potential other areas where you might lose occupancy? Sumit Roy : Those are great questions, Vikram. And thank you. So at the end of the third quarter, we were right at 98.6%. And the question was asked, where do you think you're going to end the year up? And we had said that it was going to be right around 98%. And the fact that we came at 97.9% was fairly accurate. And what we saw coming was the NPC bankruptcy filing. As you might recall, we have approximately 150 assets with NPC, most of which happens to be the Pizza Hut. And then we have 19 assets that are Wendy's that's also run by NPC.  We were expecting 66 assets to be rejected through the bankruptcy process. And that was the reason why we had guided the market to a 98 -- approximately a 98% occupancy number. We were -- and those 66 assets did come back to us during the fourth quarter, which is the largest driver of this 97.9%. You will see that the net increase in vacant assets from third quarter to fourth quarter was circa 45 assets. So despite the fact that we got 66 assets back, we were able to resolve a lot more assets than we had originally thought because these assets are very well located, Vikram, and we were able to attract either QSRs that wanted to take some of these assets. And we feel very good about being able to resolve these assets fairly quickly.  The other point I'll make is most of these Pizza Huts with NPC had less than 2 years remaining on their lease term. And so our asset management team had already begun the process of trying to figure out alternatives. Knowing fully well that these were the assets that would come back, even if it were to have not filed bankruptcy. So we feel pretty good about being able to resolve these assets. And as you can see from the resolution, we have the most number of resolutions in the fourth quarter. This was a record quarter for us. And so it's a testament to the team that we have in place, Ben and TJ, who drive that particular process for us, continue to do an absolutely amazing job despite the backdrop of the pandemic. And we are very hopeful that we will climb right back up above 98%. Look, we have frictional vacancy, and we've always suggested that to the group that because we want to have the ability to reposition some of these assets, we are always going to be in this 98% -- circa 98% occupancy rate because we do want to reposition some of these assets, which does take us time, and that will continue to be what we target going forward. Vikram Malhotra : That makes sense. And then just one, Christie, for you. The overall AFFO growth, I know there's some dilution or maybe just some headwinds near term. You obviously prefunded some of this. Can you just give us a rough sense of the AFFO growth sort of in the first half year-over-year versus the second half of the year? Christie Kelly : I think, Vikram, that in terms of where we're going to see AFFO growth, I think you can expect that to be a bit similar to historical norms outside of probably the second quarter of last year where we pulled back on acquisitions a bit. But nothing out of the ordinary. Operator : Your next question is from Haendal St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Can you talk a bit about decline in cash yields in the fourth quarter. Through the first three quarters of last year, the average cash yield were closer to 6%, decline to 5% in the fourth quarter. So you could just talk about what drove that decline. And you also mentioned that 61% of the 4Q volume was one-off transaction. So how should we think about the balance between one-offs in portfolios near term? And what type of pricing differential are you seeing there? Sumit Roy : Yes. Good question, Haendel. As you pointed out, the lower cap rate was largely driven by the mix of assets that we purchased here in the U.S. If you look at the prepared remarks, I suggested that 29% of what we purchased here in the U.S. were industrial assets, single-tenant industrial assets. These were very well placed assets with clients that who are executing on their omnichannel strategy had lease terms that were north of 10 years, some 15-year leases, good growth in markets that we wanted to enhance our exposure and with rents that were right around market rents. And so as you know, the industrial assets tend to be trading a lot more aggressively. And as such, that certainly had a bit of a downdraft on our cap rate, but the fact that we were able to do 5.2% for the U.S. assets was largely driven by that. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And then maybe a bit of color on the guide for this year, $3.25 billion. I'm curious how we should think about the yields on that front. And as part of your conversation with potential sellers, I'm curious, if in light of potential 1031 repeal, would you consider issuing units to sellers and how that might be perceived or any initial sense of -- or have you discussed that with potential sellers and what feedback you might be getting on that? Sumit Roy : Sure. Again, good questions, Haendel. Look, we came out in early January with what our pipeline looked for the first quarter. And you might recall we had about $800 million -- slightly above $800 million that we had disclosed to the market at that time that we had in our pipeline, and we were 12 days into the year. So I don't think it should have come as a surprise that we had an incredibly healthy pipeline developed coming out of the fourth quarter. And if you look at what we were able to achieve in the fourth quarter of $1 billion, we had a tremendous amount of momentum that sort of carried forward into the first quarter and that has continued. It is also a testament to the amount of sourcing that we are able to do, the new swim lanes that we have created for ourselves to continue to grow the portfolio. And I think it's a testament to the strategy that we put in place a couple of years ago to be able to now post numbers that seem very large relative to what we have come out with in years past. But that's precisely the path that we wanted to go down.  You mentioned what is the expected cap rates? I think you should expected cap rates to be similar to what we achieved in 2020. And given the mix of portfolio, the optimal portfolio allocation that we have sort of highlighted to the market, it's really going to be a function of which particular portfolio or assets closed within a quarter as to whether the cap rates are going to come out.  If it's going to have a slightly more industrial plan to it, it's going to be lower cap rates. If it's going to be more retail, it's going to have a slightly higher cap rate. Having said that, even retail, especially though those types of retail that are deemed essential, portfolios are now trading in the mid-4s. And so the pricing environment has gotten a lot more aggressive. But thankfully, we have the cost of capital, and we were still able to generate 160 basis points of spread for the entire year, which is north of our historical spread. So we feel very good about the quality of assets we are buying and how we are reshaping our portfolio along the lines of what we had shared with the market in the third quarter, et cetera.  So really, the cap rate is going to be a function of the composition of assets that we drive within a given quarter. The last question you had talked about was 1031. And what is the impact or our ability to issue OP units. Well, it's not new for us. We have done this in the past. We've bought assets from retail shareholders who wanted to buy -- wanted to take OP units as consideration for proceeds, and we were able to satisfy that. So could I see that momentum picking up potentially to defer having to pay taxes?  Absolutely. And we are very well equipped to take advantage of that. And use our equity as currency to provide that to potential sellers.  But having said all of that, 1031 is not a big part of our business, even on the disposition side. As you can see, most of the assets that we sell tend to be vacant assets, and that doesn't lend itself to the 1031 market. It's primarily developers or tenants who want to own their own assets that tend to play in that particular area. And on the occupied side, a lot of the transactions we did in 2020 were existing tenants exercising their option to purchase. And that's the reason why we were able to generate very good proceeds and very good overall returns. And the opportunistic sales tend to be an area where perhaps we run into some 1031 buyers. But that, I would say, is about 25% of the sellers that we interact with. So for us, I think the -- on the disposition side is going to be fairly muted. On the acquisition side, I think not having 1031 be as aggressive, especially on the smaller boxes like QSRs and drug stores, et cetera. We could see cap rates increase because of the lack of 1031 buyers. And so that could potentially accrue to our benefit, especially when we are engaging in these one-off asset acquisitions. Haendel St. Juste: Welcome, Christie. I look forward to meeting you in person. Christie Kelly : Thank you so much, Haendel. Me too. Operator : You our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotia Bank. Greg McGinniss : And Christie starting with you. First, welcome. Secondly, if you can just dig into guidance real quick. Is the acquisition guidance of at least $3.25 billion, which is an interesting way to say that you're probably confident you're going to get more than that. But how should we be thinking about what gets you to the top or bottom end of the AFFO per share guidance range, given that acquisition expectation. Sumit Roy : I know the question was geared towards Christie and Christie, please jump in. But why don't I take that a little bit? And then I'll hand it off to Christie, if that's okay, Greg.  For us, we wanted to make sure that we came out with a range that represented the facts on the ground today. And we wanted to make sure that the range was conservative enough where even if the situation were not to improve, and it was to be, as we have experienced early on in the year in January and December of last year that this is the range that we feel very comfortable with.  What I'm suggesting is that there could be a fair amount of upside to the range that we have shared. And it's largely a function of what's going to happen to the theater industry at large, but also, to a smaller extent, to the health and fitness industry. And there, we feel very confident that the theater business is going to improve, especially with the vaccination having taken hold and every day, we see more news about Pfizer and Moderna and now potentially J&J being on the approved list, that the acceleration of getting to a point where we have herd immunity is very realistic.  And I've seen base case models that suggest that as early as end of June, we could get close to having herd immunity. The other data point that I would point to, Greg, is what we have seen in China. And over the Chinese -- the Lunar New Year, we can -- they had record ticket sales. And in fact, one of the movies that was shown had almost $50 million more in sales than the record that had been set by Avengers : Endgame here in the U.S. and in Canada, and their opening we can't. And so all of these facts sort of lead us to believe that there is a possibility that there is a fair amount of upside on the assumptions that we have shown in our model. And that could that could help get us to the top end of the range. And if a lot of other things fall into place, potentially, we could do even better. But we can't go out with that expectation. When you lay out all the various different scenarios. You come up with what's the probability weighted outcome. And that's what we have shared with the market. But there are things that could play in our favor, and it really is a function of how you think about the theater industry and what you think the recovery is going to look like. And we've shared with you at nauseam some of the assumptions that we have drawn in terms of taking 37 of our 77 assets and viewing it on a cash accounting basis and how that percolates through the base model. If your view shifts, to say, that's perhaps a bit too conservative then there is good upside. And that's what we are super excited about.  There are certainly other levers for us to play, like you correctly pointed out, the acquisition market is something we are super excited about. And part of it is intentional and part of it is a function of more and more operators and clients that we want to do business with, wanting to engage in sale-leaseback transactions. And so that too could act as a potential tailwind. And look, we've come out with numbers. You've seen our history about the early estimates that we come out with and what we are able to achieve during the year. But not saying that -- but there too, there could be some tailwinds. So there's acquisition fronts. There are assumptions that we have made about the theater business and the health and fitness business. There are assumptions we've made about how quickly we could get to a point where things are starting to normalize, et cetera.  And all of those have room and capacity for potentially surprising on the upside. So we feel pretty good. And I'll hand it back to Christie, if there's anything else you would like to add. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. And Greg, thanks so much for the question. But I absolutely echo everything that Sumit has said. We spent, as you can imagine in the backdrop of 2020, a good bit of time really thinking about the guidance and being very thoughtful about how we went out in terms of our range of AFFO per share.  And as Sumit said, there are a number of levers that we have to the upside in terms of sale-leaseback transactions, a bit more on the acquisition side and also really looking at primarily the theater industry. And so there is positive momentum. And in light of that, we do feel, as Sumit said, very good about where we are right now and the momentum that we have in the business. Greg McGinniss : Okay. Great. For my second question, Sumit, inflation is increasingly top of conversation with investors. Could you perhaps provide some context on real TCPI-based lease escalator exposure, and how the company is positioned to provide growing returns relative to peers in an inflationary environment? Sumit Roy : Sure. So I would say about 20%. It's probably a little bit bigger than that. Of our leases have CPI adjustments. And -- but a lot of these have a floor in the ceiling associated with them. So yes, a rising CPI environment, we have some level of protection, but there does tend to be -- especially here in the U.S., there tends to be a floor in the ceiling associated with it.  For us, the -- we've encountered this problem before. What happens in an inflationary environment? The fact that we have leases that are net lease in nature. We are less sort of less susceptible to an environment where inflation expectation and actual inflation goes up because so much of the cost, either insurance, property, taxes, et cetera, are paid by our tenants. And so from that perspective, we feel pretty good. We started to see the 10-year treasury go up in anticipation of expected inflation going up. But thankfully, so far, our spreads have come down as well. And our all-in cost in the tenure has gone up slightly, but not dramatically. We can still issue tenure -- in today's environment, we think right around the 2122 ZIP code.  And that is still relative to what we've been able to do in the past, a very good all-in costs on the 10-year financing. So we feel pretty good about that. Some of this is now offset by what we are seeing in the U.K. as well as in Europe, where interest rates continue to be low, inflation expectations are very much contained. And so there, our all-in cost of financing continues to be super exciting. And so the fact that we have created all of these different alternatives also helps us shield us somewhat from inflation expectations arising in particular geographies and so we feel pretty good about that as well. And the fact that we have long-term leases also is a benefit.  Look, at some point, if the inflation expectations are going up, and it is largely translating to better GDP growth, et cetera, that should translate to better fundamentals for our tenants. And so not so much this year, we only have about 1.7% of our leases expiring. But in future years, that should start to reflect on higher market rents, et cetera. And so especially in 2022, 2023, we have a bit more of a expiration with regards to our leases, I could see us marking to market some of our leases during renewal time. And so I think from all of those perspectives, we feel pretty good.  One of the questions that often comes up, okay, if the interest rate environment continues to go up, it's going to impact your cost of capital, and that is absolutely true. But what we have found in prior cycles is that cap rates tend to follow suit as well. And there is definitely a lag, but it does sort of follow and then it allows us to continue to maintain the spreads that we have. And in certain situations, even enhance our spreads if the cap rate moves faster than our cost of capital. So we feel like we are very well positioned as a company. And based on some of the investments we've made and some of the areas that we have focused on, we feel like we are very well situated to handle an interest rate environment that increases an inflationary expectation environment that increases. Operator : Next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Welcome to the -- Christie to the earnings call. Maybe just following up on the guidance question. One of the pieces you guys showed was income taxes and that they're expected to increase in 2021. And I think that's related to U.K. activity. But could you give us some more detail on what's driving this and how we should think about it increasing in the future? And is it a function of U.K. activity? Christie Kelly : It is, Caitlin. And I think that you can expect modest increases as we continue to expand our U.K. presence. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. So if we look at like the year-over-year increase from 2020, I guess, should we just see that if you're making a similar amount of U.K. investment dollars that the income tax dollars may go up at, I don't know, kind of similar type rate? Christie Kelly : Similarly, yes. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. And then when we think about the deferrals that Realty Income put in place in 2020, I guess, could you give some detail on when you expect to receive those and to the extent that any have already been built, kind of how that collection is going. And similarly, when you'll start to know if the reserves you were taking were conservative, right? Or sort of the opposite of conservative would be aggressive. Christie Kelly : Sounds good, Caitlin. I think, first of all, what I can say is that as it relates to the deferrals that we've been taking. Essentially, when we look at the overall deferrals, we're really looking at a short-term payback and within 18 months. And as it relates to collections and the like, we are experiencing collections even before the deferrals are coming due. So we've been having some positive traction on that. All that being said, we've got 2021 in front of us. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. So when we think about what's built into guidance and the reserves that you guys took last year, obviously, you gave the guidance range. You gave thinking that it would be accurate, but is it right to think that as we go through 2021, we'll start to maybe even early in the year, get some clarity on whether or not the reserves you took in 2020 were the right amount? Christie Kelly : Yes, yes. And we go through, Caitlin, you may already know this, but a very rigorous review on our receivables positioning and it's cross functional. It involves finance, it involves legal, our asset management group and research. And so in terms of the actions that we've taken, we feel very solid about the reserve position. And as we look forward, our collections have been consistent and steady. Where we are right now in the fourth quarter, we've got close to 94% of collections. And really, when you take a look at the uncollected rent in our company, it's really a story about theaters. 80% of the uncollected rent is focused on the theater business, which is 5.6%, as you know, of our contractual rent base. And the remaining of the story is really around health and fitness, which is primarily the remaining 16% of uncollected rent. And we did incur some collections on the health and fitness business. As Sumit said and we've talked about, we still have theaters in front of us. But there've been really positive momentum, and we view that potentially could be an upside for our business going forward. Operator : Your next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Robert Stevenson : Just a question on the -- your comments on the movie theater business. Given that, would you be an incremental buyer of movie theaters in any type of scale going forward here? Sumit Roy : Yes. So Rob, I think this question was asked last quarter as well. Look, we like to reach other business. But 1 of the lessons learned through this process is that should this represent at least when the pandemic started 6% of our overall portfolio. And I think what we have concluded through this process is that this business should survive but there will be some level of real estate rationalization. And we are very happy to have put together this portfolio largely through sale leasebacks with the operators themselves. And so feel very good about our current portfolio. But the idea long-term is to continue to dwindle our exposure to this particular industry to something that is closer to a 3% ZIP code. So I think that answers your question, Rob. We feel like, over time, we need to get it down to about 3% of our overall portfolio. Robert Stevenson : Okay. Helpful. And then how are you thinking about non-U.K. European acquisitions at this point and given what's going on over there? Sumit Roy : Non-European U.K. acquisition. So how am I thinking about the U.K. acquisition? Robert Stevenson : Non-U.K., European. So the continent. So Germany, Scandinavia, outside of the U.K., are you guys -- should we expect that you guys -- you see the U.K. as a launching point to make bigger acquisitions and expand throughout Europe? Is it only going to wind up being U.K. at this point for the near term? How are you thinking about that in the context of the last 12 to 18 months in your experience there? Will we be expecting to see another line in the acquisitions at some point in 2021 or early 2022 in addition to the U.S. and the U.K., continental Europe acquisitions. Sumit Roy : We've always said that U.K. was our first step into a European strategy, a western European strategy, and that continues to be the path that we are embarking upon, Rob. We are very well-established in the U.K., some of the numbers that we have posted, I believe, is a testament to that statement. We -- I'm delighted to also share with you that we've hired another full-time person at Negara in our U.K. office. Who has a lot of experience doing acquisitions and has a lot of relationships, et cetera, in the Western Europe -- European markets. And so the goal is to continue to look for transactions and not be constrained by geography, but look for the right transactions. And there are markets that we have identified in Western Europe that we would like to be able to grow into. But it's largely a function of do we have the right operators willing to transact at the right prices, et cetera, et cetera. So are we open to acquiring in Western Europe? The answer is categorical yes. But do I expect to see something happen in Spain? I don't have a timeline for that or something in France or Italy or Germany, I don't have a timeline for you. It's largely going to be a function, what's available and who we can get to work with and whether they fit into our overall target client list. Robert Stevenson : And the financing options in the continent over there, are they as attractive to you at this point as the U.K. if you were to buy something, would you finance it in local currency? Sumit Roy : Absolutely. I mean, that's been our goal is try to minimize our exchange rate risk as much as we can, and we would follow a similar pattern to what we did in the U.K. where we did our debut, Sterling offering and prior to that, we had done a private placement, raising capital in U.K. denominated pounds. And that will continue to be how we finance our transactions. And that's where it becomes super exciting, Rob. I mean, you can do a 10-year paper in euro-denominated debt at 65, 70 basis points. Yes, cap rates are a lot more aggressive. But when you sort of factor in the cost of financing for somebody who's A-, A3 rated, it suddenly starts to make a lot of sense. And I think continuing to create alternative sources of capital, continuing to look at additional paths to growing our business is something that our platform allows us to do. And it's 1 that we are excited about, and we'll continue to push on. Operator : Next question is from Brent Dilts with UBS. Brent Dilts : So most of my stuff has been asked, but I did want to ask something. Your grocery sector exposures increased quite a bit in recent years. And I know that was intentional, but it's up to nearly 10% of rents. So maybe could you talk about how you're viewing that sector longer term, just given the wider adoption of online grocery delivery during the pandemic? I mean do you think -- like what we've seen so far is it's mostly local delivery from stores, but do you think there's any risk that disconnects from the customer's local store over time and maybe the grocery store becomes a little bit more challenged from an e commerce perspective? Sumit Roy : Yes. Brent, I don't know if you go to a local grocery even in this environment, you still find them fairly full. And I'm not trying to be facetious here. It is deemed an essential retail and they have continued to perform. Having said that, the most important thing that we are trying to focus on is the fact that the operators that we want to do business with, they have an omnichannel strategy. If you look at the U.K. grocers that we have partnered with, they dominate the click and collect market, and they dominate the delivery services. And so most of the partners that we have. And if you sort of unpack the 10%, and it's not quite 10%, but it's getting there of our exposure. You'll find that all of the operators that we have done business with are -- substantially all of the operators that we've done business with tend to have this omnichannel strategy, very well-established or in the process of having it very well established. They have the [indiscernible] and the balance sheet to do so.  And I do think that, that is going to be the future of this particular industry, which is why we got very comfortable but it's not just the industry, but it's the operators that we have targeted within these industries that we have done business with. And they will be not only surviving but thriving in the new environment where potentially, there is going to be more click and collect or delivery services. So we feel very good about our specific exposure within this industry. I don't know if this was a question or not as to whether -- are we sort of getting up against our limits with 10%. I would say, no. Our investment policy allows us to go as high as 15%. And for certain industries, we can always go back to the Board and request exceptions. But of course, we have to put forth our thesis as to why it makes sense. But this is an industry we feel very comfortable with, Brent. Brent Dilts : Okay. Yes, that makes sense. I was just curious what your longer-term thoughts were. And then just 1 other quick one. I don't know if you've really got much to say about it. But the power grid issues in Texas recently, you have decent exposure to that market. Anything we should expect there longer term? Or is it just a blip? Sumit Roy : Well, it's -- I don't want to underplay what's happening in Texas. But thankfully, as far as our exposure in Texas is concerned, again, that's the advantage of having a triple net business is that it's largely being handled by the operators. And thankfully, the disruption was fairly short term. And so most of these businesses are going to be able to come back.  Yes, they may have some issues with product not making it through this blip, as you put it. But I don't see this as being a major issue for the specific clients that we have exposure to in Texas. Operator : Your next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Spenser Allaway : Just looking to total commitments for your development pipeline. I realize it's a small portion of your overall capital deployment, but it is fairly elevated versus historical norms. So I was just wondering if you could provide some color on how you're thinking about this bucket? Should we expect it to remain elevated? And what kind of stabilized yields are you underwriting? Sumit Roy : Yes. Spenser, that's a great question. There's a reason why we have that sheet in our supplemental, and we want to lay it out as clearly as possible. This is another one of the avenues us to continue to gain exposure to certain clients and do it at a cap rate that is north of what you would be able to transact in the open market. And so it is about $160 million of commitment, $100 million of which is not funded yet. But if you look at the breakup, you will see that it's largely driven by 2 forward commitments we have on the non-retail side of the business. And so what that allows us to do is, again, enter into these contracts in a particular asset type that is trading super aggressively and be able to transact and get assets maybe 40, 50, 60 basis points north of where these assets would be trading have they been available today. And so I think that is part of the advantage of doing this. And this is, again, using our credit, using our scale and size to be able to get some of these assets at higher cap rates than what we would on the open market. The other side of this is repositioning. I think it was Vikram, who had asked about, hey, how are you thinking about these assets from NPC. We have a history of being able to reposition some of our assets and be able to really capture and enhance our rent from the same exact location by simply repositioning these assets. And that is something we've been doing for a few years. They tend to be smaller dollar amounts. But once again, we've given you that detail in the supplemental. And that will continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business. And I think as you've seen, the velocity of our lease terminations, et cetera, will only increase. And this part of our business, which we have seasoned over many years, will start to play a bigger, bigger role and will certainly, we hope, be a value-enhancing part of our business model.  And so I would love to see this business continue to increase within the parameters of what I just shared with you and help us create another source of value creation for the overall business. Operator : Your next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Wesley Golladay : Just got a quick question on dispositions. How is demand for the noncore assets for the tenants that are impacted by COVID? I know you were able to sell a theater this quarter. Do you know if that will stay a theater? Sumit Roy : Not sure. But I think, Wes, we've talked about this again, some of these theaters are located in prime locations. And we've already shared with you that, look, we don't think that the footprint of the theater business, pre-pandemic is going to be exactly the same post pandemic. So there will be some level of rationalization. But the good news is there is a fair amount of demand for last mile distribution, and there's much more of a focus on development of multifamily, given some of the trends that we are seeing in some of these markets. So it is quite possible that these assets, given that they sit on potentially 10, 12, even 15 acres of land, could be repositioned to a higher and better use. But that question, Wes, I think, is going to be very specific to the particular location and where that particular theta falls in the performance rankings. And if it tends to be in the top 2 quartile, I would say that, yes, the likelihood of it remaining at theater is high. But if not, I could easily see it being repositioned.  Perhaps not easily but certainly repositioned. Wesley Golladay : Okay. And then could you -- did you -- I don't know if you shared it already, but how much of the ABR is for tenants on cash accounting and what is the percentage collected from that tenant base? And are those mostly related outside of the theaters, mostly related to tenants that are in bankruptcy now? Sumit Roy : Christie, do you want to take this one? Christie Kelly : We have -- when we take a look, Wes, at our overall collections. I think I had mentioned this before that our collections are stable at 94%. 80% around collected rent is really as a result of the theater industry. And the remaining is really in regard to the health and fitness. Operator : Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Sumit, sorry if you already covered this. But I heard you quote cap rates on a few levels. But when we look at your $3 billion-plus acquisitions, we would assume some good-sized portfolios incorporated in that. Can you speak to portfolio premiums right now versus one-off deals? And maybe if you can bifurcate if there are premiums between retail and industrial? Sumit Roy : Yes. That's a very good question, Todd. What we had seen in -- even as late last year that there was a portfolio discount, not a portfolio premium. But there has -- we have seen a couple of portfolios come to market that have traded very expensively. And so I'm not quite sure where this trend is going to go, Todd. But -- and I think I mentioned this already that even some industries and some tenants that we had seen pre-pandemic are now trading at levels as a portfolio, 40, 50 basis points lower.  So it's tough to tell. I don't think it is a point that could be made across all industries and all operators. I do think that in most industries and especially the higher-yielding industries. If there's a portfolio transaction, you will tend to see a discount, not a premium. But in certain industries and the industries that are in favor today, we are certainly seeing a little bit of tightening. With regards to $3.25 billion, we are not underwriting to very large portfolio transactions. That is not part of our overall forecast, Todd. So if that were to happen, I think that would be above and beyond the numbers that we have shared with you. And so that, too, could be a potential tailwind for our business. As you might know, there are several public sale-leaseback transactions in the market, none of which are reflected in the numbers that we have shared.  With respect to cap rates, it is -- it has compressed. And it has compressed even over the last 5 months, 4 months. So whether it's retail here in the U.K. industrial, as you know, it's probably steady but still fairly aggressive cap rates. It's -- all has tended to become a lot more expensive today than it was 6 months ago.  In the U.K., thankfully, the cap rate market is a bit more stable. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's compressing. But it's funny, we tend to do certain transactions where we are the only ones who are engaging in conversations and then we will find 1 or 2 other potential buyers start to come in on subsequent transactions.  So this is an interesting acquisitions environment that we find ourselves in right now. And -- but we feel very good. Again, the advantages that we have, we feel like we'll be able to get more than our share of transactions done, and we will continue to do it as spreads that will be very favorable and will help us drive earnings growth. Christie Kelly : Wes, I wanted to circle back on your question. Because I had the theater numbers in my mind. But you were asking about cash accounting. And I just wanted to let you know that right now, we have almost 50 clients on a cash basis. And just to give you some color, it's a little over $5.5 million of monthly rent exposure, for which over half of that is associated with the theater industry. Let me know if that helps. Sumit Roy : Okay. Todd, any other questions? Todd Stender : That's it for me. Operator : Your next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Tallman. John Massocca : First off, welcome to the earnings call, Christie. Thank you. I know we're getting a little long on the call here, so I'll keep it to 1 question. Has there been any change with regards to rent collection quarter-to-date in 1Q '21 versus, say, 4Q '20. I mean essentially, can you provide any color on any of these troubled industries or non-paying tenants? Are any of them starting to maybe pay that hadn't been paying in December, November, October? Sumit Roy : Yes. I could probably help with that a little bit. I mean, if we take a look at year-to-date, the January recollection was relatively consistent with what we've been seeing in the past months towards that 94% range. And essentially, the theater industry is still the majority at approximately 80%. And we did see some pickup as it relates to health and fitness. And it's a little early for February. But overall, as we said at the start of the call, it's consistent and steady. John Massocca : Okay. But the improvement you've seen so far this quarter has been largely on the health and fitness side rather than the theaters? Christie Kelly : Like that, yes. But I would like to say too that theaters are paying. Operator : Your next question comes from Katie McConnell with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman. Can you hear me? Sumit Roy : Yes. We can hear you, Mike. This is what happens when I'm in the office. Katie is in Philadelphia. We have an associated home. Creates that lot merging that doesn't work too well sometimes. I was wondering if you can provide some perspective. Obviously, when you switch over from banking, you went to Duke as the CFO. And then with CBRE, you sit on Park Hotels, Kite Realty, Tiers Board. You came out to Realty Income board last year. Net lease and what Realty Income is very different from those other companies in terms of the type of business in terms of creating growth with this longer duration net leases really where the competitive advantage is the cost of capital. And obviously, the relationships that the company has. But the secret to this company is being able to access well-priced capital and finding the deals. Just talk about sort of your perspectives and how you think the company should be capitalized?  How you think about capital raising relative to your prior experiences? Certainly, Michael. It's great. Great to hear your voice again, and I look forward to seeing you in person. But I wasn't at CBRE. I was at JLL. Michael Bilerman : Just a broker. Close enough. Christie Kelly : But in terms of overall thoughts, Michael, you've known me for a long time. And I think that you really -- and obviously understand the triple-net lease business. Now really being competitive and leveraging our scale and thoughtfulness on the capital markets side is really, I think, what you seen from us historically, what you saw from us at the beginning of the year and what you can expect from us going into the future.  As Sumit mentioned, we're excited about what we're seeing in the U.K. in terms of the debt markets and what we can execute at. And should something come to fruition on the continent. We have a lot -- we have some very favorable aspects, we believe, on the continent from a debt perspective as well. And when we take a look at capitalization, I mean, you can expect us to protect our balance sheet and really be focused on that net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5% -- 5.5x, as we mentioned, and really going forward in that regard. And sitting back, you mentioned some of those other businesses. I mean, as you know, Realty Income is just a fantastic business with a great team, and I'm really excited about joining the team.  We have a long runway ahead of us, great growth potential. And as Sumit's been mentioning some really exciting things to continue to add value to our clients. Michael Bilerman : As you think about sort of cash flow growth, you talked a little bit about on the call of some of the industries that are having some issues and how that could sway guidance. But part of the weaker growth is the prefunding of a lot of the transaction volumes given the sheer amount of equity that you raised in the fourth quarter and earlier this year, how should we think about your cadence on equity because it is depressing current earnings should -- was that like a rebalance for '21? Or should we expect an acceleration of growth as we move through the year and into 2022 solely focused on the transaction side of the equation? Sumit Roy : Not necessarily, Michael. I mean we were just taking advantage of the market at that point in time, and it was really an opportunistic play given the acquisition pipeline that we had in front of us. So you can expect us to still be managing our debt-to-equity equation thoughtfully in keeping with our A rating, but not being overly aggressive, if you will, to cause dilution. Operator : Your next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Barber : Just wanted to see what the latest was on the 7-Eleven portfolio that's in the market and kind of your current feeling about if you would consider adding to your 7-Eleven exposure? Sumit Roy : Joshua, I'll take that question. So we don't talk about specific transactions. You also can see that 7-Eleven is a top 10 tenant of ours. It's a client that we have done repeat business with. We help do their first sale-leaseback in 2016 and did subsequently 4 other sale leasebacks directly with them. So clearly, it's an operator. It's -- that we really like. It's in an industry that we like, and especially the standing that 7-Eleven has within the [indiscernible] store business, we really like their positioning. And so then the question becomes okay, what about the 11% industry exposures that you have to convenience store business. Is that a factor that could potentially curbed our ability to do more? And I think I've answered this question before, we have a limit of 15%, and we can always get exceptions in the event we can make the case that a particular industry is one that we are very favorable, we implying towards and would like to see it increase. And this is one of those industries that we would feel very comfortable in increasing our allocation to. But again, we have to be very specific that it's industry increase in allocation, but with particular clients in mind and 7-Eleven would that will be falling in that bucket. Operator : Your next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : In terms of acquisitions, what type of competition do you run into on larger portfolio deals? And who would be willing to take on tenant concentration to get some of these larger deals done? Sumit Roy : Are you asking us about whether we would be willing to take the tenant concentration? Or is this a general question, Linda? Linda Tsai : It's just more of a general question around competition. When you're looking at these larger portfolio deals, and maybe who some of the competitors are out there that would be willing to take on concentration? Sumit Roy : Sure. So that's 1 of the things that we talked about, Linda, is the fact that we do have the size and the scale to absorb large portfolios. Now the way I would define large portfolios is $1 billion plus. Most peers would run into concentration questions doing half that size. Especially if they already have a preexisting exposure to that particular client. But we find ourselves in the enviable position of being able to continue to increase the allocation for a given client, and it's largely a testament to the size of our overall business and balance sheet. But clearly, when you start talking $5 billion, $6 billion, those are types of transactions that don't come very often. And when they do, outside of us, I don't know if there is any other public net lease buyer that could potentially entertain absorbing that sort of size.  Then in terms of who are the alternative buyers of this. It's largely driven by what is available on the financing side of the equation. And ABS has become a preferred mechanism of financing these large scale transactions, especially with highly rated operators. And then once those boxes are checked, you can pretty much assume some of the private equity folks getting involved and being super excited about playing in that size because they can put capital to work, and lever up the portfolio to, call it, 85%, 90% and be able to get very -- enhance their cash-on-cash yield. So that's the group that would be the traditional competition for very large sale-leaseback opportunities with highly rated operators.  But when interest rate starts to move in the direction that it has, then that does start to put pressure on some of these players because the cost of financing on that 80%, 90% leverage starts to creep up. So it really is going to have to be coupled with what we see in the financing market to help define who the potential competition could be. Linda Tsai : Got it. And then just in terms of the cash basis tenants, what percentage did you collect from the cash basis tenants in 4Q and in 3Q? Sumit Roy : Yes. I'll let Christie answer that. Christie Kelly : We had a couple of million. Linda, I believe. Okay. Linda Tsai : And then just for the 40 theaters that aren't on a cash basis, it sounds like we should assume they're paying some level of rent. For the 40, are they concentrated under 1 banner versus another? In your disclosure, you show 40 Regal and 32 AMC? Sumit Roy : Yes. I can answer that. Yes, about 41 of these assets, when we did our internal analysis, we deemed them to be in this top quartile. And that's how we came up with the 41. But when we talked about us getting some rent from both AMC as well as Regal, especially in the month of December. It was across the entire portfolio. So even those assets, those 37 assets that we have on cash accounting, they paid us rent. Not 100%. But they paid us some rent for the month of December, and that's really the upside for us going forward. Operator : At this time, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the conference over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : So thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you at the upcoming virtual conferences. Take care. Bye-bye. Christie Kelly : Thanks, everybody.",

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income. Thank you. Please go ahead. Julie Hasselwander : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During this conference call, we will certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that cause such differences in the Company's form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call-in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. The continued strength of our business is made possible by the incredible partnerships we have with all stakeholders. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to our Realty Income team who continues to effectively execute our strategic objectives while enduring a sustained, remote work environment. As we've announced last week, we are excited to have reached a definitive merger agreement with VEREIT, which would further distance ourselves as a leader in the net lease industry and create a company with a combined enterprise value of approximately $50 billion. We believe shareholders of both companies will enjoy meaningful value creation through immediate earnings accretion and expanded platform with enhanced size, scale and diversification, driving further growth opportunities, and strategic and financing synergies which are enhanced by Realty Income's A rated balance sheet and access to well-priced capital. We are very excited about the strategic transaction and look forward to continuing to drive future growth together as a combined enterprise. However, today we will focus on what was a very successful first quarter for Realty Income. Our first quarter results illustrate our ability to grow through a variety of swim lanes afforded to us by our size and scale by completing over $1 billion in acquisitions. Notably, in this quarter, we invested approximately $403 million in high quality real estate in the UK, highlighting the continued strength of our international platform and bringing that total investment in the UK to over $2 billion since the first international acquisitions we closed in 2019. Domestically, we invested $625 million in real estate, including our first ever acquisition in Hawaii, becoming the first and only REIT to own property in all US states. Our accomplishments during the quarter continue to demonstrate the momentum in our business, and highlight our ability to leverage our size and scale to drive our business forward in pursuit of sustainable growth. On the subject of sustainable growth, our team continues to make tremendous progress through our ESG initiative, as ESG considerations continue to permeate throughout our organization at every level. In April, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report, which details our company's commitments, goals and progress to-date with regard to environmental, social, and government initiatives. I invite all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to embrace the changing world for the benefit of all those we serve. And I encourage everyone listening to read our 2020 Sustainability Report found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. Additionally, we are excited to share an updated investor presentation to the marketplace. On the homepage of our website, you can find our new deck, which highlights our fundamental business philosophies, key competitive advantages, and plan for future growth. Turning to results for the quarter, our global investment pipeline remains a significant driver of growth for our business. Our business is simple. We seek to acquire high quality real estate lease to leading operators in economically resilient industries in pursuit of stable and increasing cash flow generation. Our confidence in continuing to grow our platform stems from the quality of our real estate portfolio, which is designed for resiliency through a variety of economic environments. Key to mitigating economic risk, we believe in portfolio diversification by geography, client, industry and property type as we continue to grow our real estate portfolio. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested over $1 billion in high quality real estate and we remain very comfortable with our 2021 acquisition guidance of over $3.25 billion. On a total revenue basis, approximately 39% of total acquisitions during the quarter are leased to investment grade rated clients, which brings our total investment grade client exposure for the portfolio to approximately 50%. Aligning with our equals, the weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.6 years. And at the end of the quarter, the weighted average lease term of our total portfolio was 8.9 years. As at quarter end, our real estate portfolio includes over 600 clients who operate in 56 different industries. Approximately 84% of rental revenue comes from our traditional retail properties, while industrial properties generated about 11% of rental revenue. With regard to our retail business, we seek to invest in industries with a service non-discretionary and or low price point component of the business, as we believe these characteristics make for economically resilient operation that can more effectively compete with e-commerce. As such of our acquisitions during the quarter, the largest industry represented were grocery stores. Walgreens remains our largest client at 5.5% of rental revenue, and convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue. Our investment philosophy primarily focuses on acquiring freestanding single unit commercial properties leased to best-in-class clients under long-term net lease agreements typically in excess of 10 years. We believe the market is efficient. As such, we've seen a competitive environment for high quality assets leased to strong operators. Cap rates, as you all know, reflect an aggregation of many factors including but not limited to fundamental real estate economics, lease term, credit of the client or their sponsor, rent relative to the market, average rent coverage by the operator and alternative use of the real estate. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisitions is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the first quarter of 5.3%. Our size and scale allow us to be highly selective in pursuing investment opportunities that fit our stringent criteria. This quarter we sourced nearly $20 billion of transaction opportunities, ultimately investing in approximately 5% of the prospects sourced and reviewed. Additionally, our cost of capital allows us to invest accretively even when pursuing the highest quality assets. During the first quarter our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were 115 basis points. The quality of the assets we acquire flows through the entire lifecycle of our portfolio, allowing us to basically recapture rent on expiring leases and maintain a healthy level of occupancy. During the quarter, we re-leased 54 units, re-capturing 103.5% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3600 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, re-capturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts, and occupancy at quarter end was 98%. Our size and scale afford us the ability to execute large scale sale leaseback transactions which are often sourced through existing partnerships with best-in-class clients, but also serve as an attractive way to establish new relationships. The transaction we closed in Hawaii is an excellent example of the sale leaseback opportunities we can execute. In this instance, we partnered with Par Petroleum to acquire 22 well located convenience stores for approximately $116 million. All 22 properties fall under one triple net master lease agreement with an initial 15-year lease term. And all assets are located in many main locations, primarily on the island of O'ahu. This quarter, about 24% of all acquisitions we close were executed as sale leaseback transactions. The merger between Realty Income and VEREIT will enhance our ability to execute large scale leaseback transactions through expanded capacity to buy in bulk, which improve our competitive positioning when competing for portfolio or sale leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry. As we have previously articulated, the ability to buy at wholesale prices and at a discount to the one-off market is a competitive advantage. We are often one of only a handful of buyers for large scale portfolio transactions, particularly those that would otherwise create untenable client or industry concentration issues for our competitors. Proforma for the closing of the transaction, we will have approximately $2.5 billion of annualized rental revenue. For every $1 billion of acquisition to a single creditor industry, our exposure to that creditor industry will increase by approximately 2% compared to around 3.5% based on our current size. By leveraging our size and scale, we continue to effectively execute through our international platform. We have healthy acquisition volume in the UK. Fundamentally, we are replicating our U.S. business strategy, seeking to curate a high-quality real estate portfolio leased to leading operators in economically resilient industries. Our total first quarter acquisition volume improved approximately $403 million of international acquisitions in the UK, which brings us total investment volume to more than $2 billion since the first transaction we closed in the UK in 2019. Our International pipeline has accelerated even more quickly than originally anticipated. This quarter's International acquisition volume represents nearly 40% of our total investment volume during the quarter. A figure that is truly incremental to the U.S. business and one that we expect to grow. Now I'll pass it over to Christie to provide financial updates. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. I'll start with some high-level background and then move into our financial results for the quarter. We're the only net lease REIT from the S&P 500, one of the top 10 largest U.S. REITs by enterprise value and the largest company in the net lease REIT sector. Upon closing our recently announced merger with VEREIT, Realty Income is expected to be the sixth largest REIT in the [ph] RMZ in terms of equity market capitalization. Our size and scale, in conjunction with our conservative balance sheets and financial strength have afforded us to a credit rating by the major rating agencies and our $3 billion multi-currency revolver grants us ample access to well-priced capital that allows us to opportunistically raise permanent long-term capital when the markets are most favorable. During the quarter, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering to reduce our financing risk by pre-funding our active global investment pipeline. In January 2021, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25% notes due in 2022 to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market, while reducing our near-term financing risks. This redemption was primarily funded through our December issuance of $725 million of senior unsecured notes through a dual tranche offering of a five year and 12-year note, which achieved record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. As a result, our fixed charge coverage ratio, I'm pleased to report, has hit an all-time high at 5.8 times this quarter. We believe funding our business with approximately two-thirds equity and one-third debt contributes to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3 times or 5.2 times on a proforma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal, with only $26 million of debt maturing through year end 2021 excluding our commercial paper program and borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, we had full availability of our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, $675 million outstanding under our $1 billion commercial paper program, and over $184 million of cash on hand, providing approximately $2.5 billion of liquidity available to capitalize on our active global investment pipeline. During the quarter, our business generated $0.86 cents of AFFO per share and we are maintaining our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49 on a standalone Realty Income basis unadjusted for the expected merger. Remember, we currently have 37 of our 79 Theater assets on cash accounting. These 37 theaters represent about $25.5 million dollars of annual rent remaining in 2021. And we've reserved $33.2 million as allowance for bad debt on these assets, net of $1.9 million of straight-line rent receivables. In total, this $58.7 million translates to approximately $0.15 that is not currently included in AFFO per share guidance. We are encouraged by the recent momentum in the theatre space, such as increased nationwide opening and the release of blockbuster films. Most recently, Godzilla versus Cong brought in approximately $49 million during the opening weekend, five days specifically Wednesday to Sunday, and generated more than $390 million in revenue within the first two weeks of its global release, turning a profit of more than $200 million. However, until we are confident these particular theaters can continue to pay us contractual rent. We will continue to recognize revenue for these 37 theatres on a cash basis. As the monthly dividend company, we would be remiss not to discuss the dividends when providing business results. In April, we declared our 610th consecutive monthly dividends and we now increase the dividend 110 times since our listing in the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result of increasing the dividend every year for the past 25 consecutive years, we are proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index which consists of only three REIT and 65 companies overall. I would now like to hand our call back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christie. Our first quarter results continue to highlight the incredible opportunities afforded to us by our size and scale, which uniquely position us to be the global consolidator in a highly fragmented net leased space. And we believe the very merger will enhance our positioning to be just that. Our positive results as well as our powerful business momentum and in strong outlook energize our talented team to continue expanding our existing verticals, while finding new swim lanes through which the business can grow. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : Hey Sumit. The VEREIT acquisition has dramatically increased your exposure to casual dining tenants to 7% of ABR, which is an industry where other REITs seem to be limiting exposure. What makes you comfortable with acquiring all those tenants? Sumit Roy : That's certainly an area that we spent a fair amount of time focusing on Greg, when we were looking at VEREIT. The biggest contributor to that 7% is Red Lobster. And looking at where Red Lobster is today versus even where it was a year ago, gave us a fair amount of confidence that Red Lobster has turned the corner from being privately equity owned to being owned by a company out of Thailand Thai Union. And the credit enhancements that it achieved, the results that it is now posting, the fact that it gave --that it paid 100% of the rent in the fourth quarter to VEREIT. All of that gave us confidence that it's turned the corner and being vertically integrated organization, such as Thai Union is made us feel like 7% is a number that we can live with. But the goal here Greg will be over time to continue to reduce that, just like we did with our casual dining concept which used to be in the high single digits. And today represent less than 3% of our overall registry. And that will be the goal with on a proforma basis being up to 7% continuing to reduce that back down into the low single digits. Greg McGinniss : Okay, thank you. Second question, given less concern about tenant concentration issues following the VEREIT merger, are there portfolios in the marketplace today that you now feel more comfortable pursuing? Are those types of portfolios already considered in acquisition guidance? And then how much volume do you think those types of portfolios could potentially contribute to acquisition each year? Sumit Roy : Yeah, there's a bunch of questions you've asked there, Greg. The question is, we've talked about how proforma for this acquisition, it allows us to pursue larger transactions. I will say that you don't have multibillion dollar transactions coming in every week. But when you do, they can be a step growth, opportunity, just like a consolidation is in our industry. But given our size today, doing a multibillion-dollar transaction, we were somewhat constrained, pursuing that even if it checked all the other boxes, i.e. we like the credit, we like the operator, we like the industry, we like the makeup of the real estate, we like the rent composition, et cetera, et cetera. You feel constrained, just given how much of your portfolio concentration gets impacted by a single tenant. But once you start to increase your platform, the ability to absorb larger transactions, when they present themselves, certainly enhances. And there have been opportunities and I don't want to get into details, when even in the past 12 months, there have been opportunities to pursue transactions, where given, everything that we have relationship, to check the boxes across the spectrum we were still constrained by the allocation that we had to be able to pursue this particular transaction single-handedly. And those are the types of constraints that do get alleviated, the larger your platform becomes. And it does allow you to be able to present yourself as a one stop shop for some of these very well capitalized businesses that you want to continue to be their one stop shop, which we have been in this one example that I'm referencing. So, yeah, I do think that, post this consolidation, that it will enhance our position to pursue transactions that we were, somewhat constrained to do so in our current size and scale. Greg McGinniss : Thanks, Sumit. Operator : Your next question comes from Katy McConnell from Citi. Katy McConnell : Hi there. Sumit Roy : Hi Katy. Katy McConnell : Could you update us on the portfolio of office assets that you plan to spin off with the merger? And now that the deals out in the open what have you been able to gauge as far as buyer interest in your ability to potentially sell those off instead? Sumit Roy : Kate, it's been three business days since we made the announcement. But thank you for asking the question. Yeah, look, we've been pleasantly surprised by the inbounds. We're still in the process of collecting those inbounds and trying to figure out what's real from what's not real? We have been very clear that the path that we control is the spin off path. To answer your question more directly, it's essentially all of our office assets along with the vast majority of the of the VEREIT office assets outside of the six assets that are constrained by a CMBS pool, which is cross collateralized across multiple asset types. So outside of the six, our goal would be to basically spin off all of the remaining assets, which is right around 97 properties, $182 million $183 million in rent, weighted average lease term circa 4, 76% 77% investment grade tenants. That's the makeup of the portfolio. But as we had thought would happen, once we announced there have been inbound calls, we are just gathering the information, but it is still too early to tell what's real from what's not. We are going to continue down the path that we control. And if something were to happen in the meantime, that's great. But it's too early to tell. Katy McConnell : Okay I appreciate that color. And then can you talk a little more about the decision to just enter the Hawaii market now? And whether you all want to increase the scale there more meaningfully or potentially pursue any industrial opportunities there? Sumit Roy : Yeah, Katy, it's just, it's not something we intentionally pursued in this particular quarter. We've always, two CEOs ago, Tom was from Hawaii. And the inside joke was how come we don't have any properties there. Now, Jonathan Png is our resident Hawaiian. And the joke has continued, but it really was the function of the bright opportunity presenting itself at the right time with a partner that we liked, we underwrote their business, we underwrote their performance, we underwrote their locations, it was just the right time at the right place. And it just so happened that it closed in the first quarter. There wasn't any grand design to be able to come out and make the kinds of announcements that we have done. We've been very opportunistic, very lucky in some ways, and very grateful to now be able to say that we are in 50 states, but that to us was not as important as finding the right transaction. And this particular transaction that allowed us to go to Hawaii certainly checks all the boxes. So, we're very grateful for that. Katy McConnell : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, good afternoon, just two quick ones for me. The first is just on tenant's health in general on the portfolio. Maybe if you could provide some updated thoughts on how you're feeling today, maybe versus six and 12 months ago? And then digging in a little bit deeper into some of the theaters and looking at the collection rates there, maybe some insights as the collection rate may have been a little bit lower than what we would have expected. Maybe what's going on there with theaters? Sumit Roy : Sure, Ronald, thank you for your question. Look, our watch list is right around 5%. And it's the biggest contributor to that watch list is the theater business. So, they are very much tied. And our collection is also largely a function of the collection in the theater business. We feel you asked me to give you a reference point as to how we feel about a theatre business today versus when we first got into the pandemic, we feel a lot better today than we did then. There have been actual examples here in the U.S., which were preceded by examples playing out in China and in Japan, which lend credence to the hypothesis that we had, that the theater business once the contents was starting to get released and the social distancing norms were relaxed, the theater business was going to be able to bounce back. That piece has largely proven out to be the case, Ronald. I mean, if you look at the only one example that we currently have of a big blockbuster movie that came out, which was the Godzilla versus Kong. In the first five days, it generated right around $49 million. We've been tracking how it has done subsequent to that as well. And it's right in that high 80 right around $90 million is the collection here in the U.S. theaters. If you look at it globally, it's close to $390 million. And the budget to make that movie was right around $180 million $190 million. So, $200 million roughly largely being gathered through the theater release. And that just continues to lay credence to that as content starts to come in, as these theaters are allowed to open, AMC is largely open here in the U.S. Regal is still not. Regal is still targeting mid to late May, to open up all of its theaters. And so, we do believe that this connection is going to become a function of the theaters opening. And based on the discussions that we've had with our operators, we continue to feel very optimistic that in the near term, those collection numbers will start to go up. But look, we're also blessed with a balance sheet, to lend grace to some of these operators, as long as we believe that their operating model is going to come through and it's going to be a viable business model going forward. And we genuinely believe that the theatre industry, and specifically these two operators are going to be viable operators going forward. And so, if we have the ability to lend our balance sheet, give them a little bit more grace, in terms of stabilizing their operating business model, that's what we've done. And we feel very good about that decision. Christie Kelly : And Ronald, this is Christie. The only thing I would add to Sumit's comments is just a reminder to the team that's on the line is that, our theater portfolio is really high quality. There's over 80% of the theaters in our portfolio that are in the top two core piles of each of the operator's footprint. And as Sumit mentioned AMC is open, but it limited capacity right now and Regal Theaters will be opening towards the end of May. And to that point, we're cautiously remain cautiously optimistic. But there's one thing I want to point out that, when we take a look at the momentum, as it relates to the collection rate in theaters, it's steady and improving. So, stabilize from year end, we were about 10% collection and then throughout the quarter, we've gained some momentum to build towards 16%. And so, we'll look forward to recording more when we come to the second quarter. Ronald Kamdem : Great, that's helpful. My second question was just going back to the VEREIT merger. This may be just a simple question but just can you help us understand how your real estate the quality of your real estate, the quality of the retail assets that you own compares to those of VEREIT that you're going to be taking in, right? How should investor think about comparing and contrasting the quality of those portfolios, specifically, the retail piece? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Yeah, Ronald we've got 3500 properties that has been constructed over the last 11 years, since they became public. Clearly there are areas of the portfolio, one of which we touched on, has turned the corner. But it wasn't something that we would have pursued in isolation six years ago when they when they chose to do that transaction. But by and large, I would say we were pleasantly surprised when we underwrote all of their assets, all of their operators at the quality of the portfolio they had, and there was an art to be making, for whatever reason, and we're grateful, because it allowed us to create a lot of value for our business, that they were trading at a massive discount to what we believe is the inherent value, especially of their retail and industrial portfolio. And so, the other point I would like to highlight is the fact that they are complementary to our focus. This is why, things like convenience stores which we are big fans of with certain operators I want to qualify allows us to go from 12% to 9% proforma for the combination. It allows us to take our grocery from 10% to 8%, because they don't have those allocations in their portfolio. And so that certainly helps us create additional capacity plus on the theater business, they didn't have much of an exposure. So that allows us to bring down our theater exposure from 5.7% 5.6% to 3.8%, which is starting to get closer to the optimal adaptation that we have been talking about over the last couple of quarters. So, pleasantly surprised on the upside, which is one of the main reasons why we decided to move forward. And we're so grateful that we found a like-minded person and Glenn and his management team to move forward with a transaction that we genuinely believe is a win-win for both parties. So, yeah, super happy to absorb that retail and industrial portfolio into the proforma Realty Income business. Ronald Kamdem : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good afternoon out there. Sumit Roy : Hi Haendel. Haendel St. Juste: Can you talk about the - hello? Can you guys talk about the acquisition capital a bit more in the first quarter the low 5% of all 4.9% in UK? I believe last quarter, you suggested that cap rates would be - for this year would get back, would be similar to 2020 levels, they are closer to maybe 6% depending on mix? I understand you're seeing increased competition. We've heard of financial buyers getting 85% 90% LTV financing ABS market. So maybe, can you talk about the market and what roll that competition out from potential buyers? Is this playing on the pricing for the assets that you're looking at? And is it specific to any sub sector industry and if this low 5% cap rate is what we should expect in 2021? Sumit Roy : Yeah. So, Haendel quarter-over-quarter these numbers are going to vary and it is largely a function of the mix. If you're going to be heavily industrial focus, the cap rates are going to be on the lower end. If you're going to be more retail focus, it will be on the higher end. I'm making general comments. Obviously, there are exceptions to even to what I just said. But if you look at what drove the UK cap rate, it was largely two industrial transactions that we did with the same seller that we have a very good relationship with. One was an industrial asset in the Greater London area, highly sought clearly a last mile location and we got it at a cap rate we felt very comfortable owning this particular asset. Another one was in the suburbs of Birmingham; you know that it's leased to a single a credit. Again, fantastic distribution center below market rents. Something that we feel like is going to be super additive to our portfolio going forward. And that's what really drove the cap rate to where it was. Had we excluded those two, our cap rate would have been closer to where we did our fourth quarter UK transactions, which was, I believe, if I remember correctly, 5.6 5.7 cap rate. So, it really is going to be a function of mix, it's going to be a function of which geography dominates, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think you should expect the cap rate we posted in the first quarter to be the new norm. I would still say that we should average right in that mid 5s to do slightly above that, that would be the goal. And in quarters where we do some more higher yielding stocks, because it's things that we found that the people are not focused on yet, we could see a potential 6. But it really is going to be a function of a mix, it's going to be a function of asset type, lease term, geography, all of those things that go into defining what a quarter cap rate signifies. But I think the bigger point here is, this is the second quarter in a row where we've done a billion dollars. And I've seen a lot of numbers coming out talking about Oh, in order for them to get to the high single digit growth rate, they're going to have to do $4 billion of acquisition. We welcome that challenge. In fact, we are excited about that challenge. And we've already talked about what creating these new verticals for us, new markets growth for us has done to our sourcing numbers, which is not translating into actual [ph] clothes. So, for us, the numbers being posted, yes, for most net lease businesses that's a staggering number. But for us, it's something that we welcome, and we also agree with the market that it is for us to show to you that we are capable of doing this on a quarter after quarter after quarter basis. So that's where the fun part is for us and the team. We look forward to that challenge. And we look forward to posting numbers with assets that doesn't compromise what we have said is our risk profile. And that's the key message here, that we are doing all of this. And we are growing our platform and we are growing our portfolio with the right type of industries, right operators, right geographies, right growth rates, all of the things that we create sustained value over the long term. So, I know you didn't quite ask that. But I just wanted to make sure that we output the answer on cap rates in context to what it is that we are trying to do. And the sustainability of what it is that we're trying to do. So, forgive me for that Haendel. Haendel St. Juste: No. That's perfect. Thank you for the color, I certainly appreciate it. Can you also talk a bit perhaps, are you a bit more willing today at all to consider industries that you perhaps put off to the side over the past year in the aftermath of COVID? Perhaps, expanding your investment playbook here, be automotive more entertainment or experiential things that have been a bit less COVID resilient, but given the improving vaccine distribution as the economic expansion, just curious if that view is changing at all, and if there's any specific industries reflect to? Sumit Roy : Haendel, one of the things that will distinguish this team, I think, and I believe in, is the fact that we will always remain humble. If data is changing on the ground, if trends are changing, we're constantly trying to mark the market. But what we don't want to do is over index to any near-term phenomenon, just like we didn't over index to the fact that, hey, the theater business and the health and fitness business really took a took a beating in an environment where you have social distancing requirements. And does that mean we should go down to zero in both those businesses? The answer is no. And so, what we are trying to figure out is, what are the trends, especially given the long-term nature of the leases that we enter into, what is the trend long term that we are going to underwrite to? And just because something creates a potential opportunity near term, if we can't get comfortable with the long-term prospects, we will largely stay away from those types of situations. Now that doesn't mean we don't get a few things wrong. And in hindsight, we don't go back saying, Oh, we should have made that a different way, because our conclusion was inaccurate. But we, I believe, have gotten more things right than wrong. And that has served us well. So, the answer to your question is, without getting into specifics that we are constantly trying to upgrade our pieces to reflect what's on the ground. But we don't try to over index to it without taking into consideration with the long-term impacts of those immediate trends that we're seeing. I'll throw something out there, which is the exact opposite of what you're suggesting. I think there is an opportunity in the office sector. Now, are we going to go into the office sector? No, there's a reason why we said we are going to be spinning off all of our office assets. But I do believe that given the environment today, and given how negative the sentiment is around the office asset type, there is value to be had. If somebody is willing to take a longer-term perspective on what is office going to look like. And that's the reason why we want to create a spin off if that is the route, we end up eventually evacuating. We want to set it up for success. And it is a play on what we have seen near term. And then it's forecasting out that trendline to see what do you think it's going to happen to Office five, seven, 10 years from now? Where do we see growth? Yes, growth? I use that word with Office. Where do we see opportunities? And, there is an argument to be made that that could play out so Time will tell. Haendel St. Juste: Any perspective you want to share on the casinos? I know it's been asked in the past. But I'm curious is that view and that subsector is any different or any more willingness today to act on that? Sumit Roy : Yeah, I'm not going to talk about specifics Haendel. And you've always asked me very specific questions, and I've tried to stay away from it. You asked me about M&A. And I did M&A for you now. No, no, stay away from specifics Haendel. Thank you though. Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, guys, hi there. Sumit, you gave some details to explain the relatively lower cap rate in the UK this quarter. But there's also the associated tax burden in the UK which impacted numbers in the quarter. So, I was just wondering, kind of big picture if you could go through why the UK investment activity makes sense to you bigger picture and then also how we should think about the associated tax expense going forward? Sumit Roy : Yes, very good questions, Caitlin. Thank you. I should have actually completed my answer on the UK, giving a little bit more color on the structuring side of the equation. So, we went into the UK recognizing that there's going to be an associated track tax leakage. And when we underwrite transactions, we take into account what is our effective tax rate? What is the statutory tax rate? What's the effective tax rate? How much are we really making in terms of actual spreads, et cetera, et cetera. And of course, comparing it to the cost of capital, which is also much lower in the UK. And seeing if it's if it made sense. It made a lot of sense. And by and large, I think we are tracking to the effective tax rates that we had shared with the market two years ago in April of 2019. What I would like to add Caitlin is, there is a change that is being contemplated, that would actually increase the statutory tax rate in the UK market. But what we have been exploring and hopefully we'll be able to implement in the near term is restructuring our Realty Income limited the legal entity that that is house there where we will actually end up potentially saving 400 basis points off of our effective tax rate. So, do you expect to see this this the taxes being paid in the UK continuing to go up? Absolutely, you should. But not at the same rate as you have seen over the last three years. We are getting more efficient. We are structuring our transactions going forward in a manner where we are actually going to see on an effective basis and decrease in the tax leakage associated with our investments. And we are constantly looking at how we're going to be financing this transaction, and does it still make sense? And the answer is a resounding yes, it does. And that's the reason why we're continuing to do what we're doing. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then maybe switching topics, the guidance that you guys have put out assumes that same store revenue improves as the year goes on. There was commentary earlier on hopefully improving theater collections and performance and acquisitions are expected to continue. But the AFFO guidance kind of barely implies any growth from the 1Q run rate. So, I was just wondering, why is that? How does the improving same store revenues and acquisitions not translate into more meaningful AFFO for the guidance or is the AFFO guidance just pretty conservative at this point? Sumit Roy : That's an opinion. I'll let you conclude that for yourself, but I do think Christie mentioned as to the 37 assets that are on cash accounting, so, so much of the improvement that could play out in the future has not been sort of reflected in the guidance that we have shown, but nor have we changed our cash accounting on those 37 assets. So, we really, if you want to use the word conservative, fine, we just really want to see actual collections go back up to levels that warrant a change in our thesis around cash accounting versus not. And then that would certainly translate to higher AFFO per share trend lines. But we tend to be a little bit more deliberate. And, yes, things are looking very optimistic. But until it's not actually starting to reflect in enclosed monthly statements, we're going to stay the course. And, obviously, what we have and the reason why we haven't adjusted is for the merger is because first and foremost, there are conditions involved. And even if this were to close, it won't happen to the fourth quarter, which clearly will have a very minimal impact this year. And so, for those reasons, we have kept the guidance, exactly the same. We want to digest what we just announced last week. We also want to get another quarter under our belt, and then we revisit earnings at the end of the second quarter. And share with you what our latest thoughts are on that. Caitlin Burrows : Okay, thank you. Christie Kelly : Thanks, Caitlin. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Rob Stevenson : Good afternoon. You guys currently have as of March 31, 131 vacant assets and presumably you'll have additional assets become vacant over the remainder of the year. Ordinarily, some percentage of that you guys keep and release and some you sell and move on. Given the size of the very transaction of the integration process, how do you guys think about your team's bandwidth and maybe just selling a greater percentage of the vacant assets that they can't be released easily and moving on, and focusing on the integration versus the time energy and even the potential upside from re-leasing vacancy? Sumit Roy : We are very comfortable executing exactly the same business model that we have. We have always said that, if you want to run a business 100% occupancy we can. But that is not value optimizing solution. And the reason why we have also shared with the market, our real estate operations team as is the largest in the company is to be able to do the things that we want to do. That is the reason why we have always said that 98% is the right occupancy level for us because we are going to be repositioning assets where we can create, and these numbers get buried, but 140% 170% recapture rates on rent just because of these repositioning that we are able to do but yes, it takes time and yes, that means more, you're sitting on more non-occupied assets. But we are very comfortable doing that, if that is the right economic solution to do so. And just to put things in perspective, that 131 was 140 at the end of the fourth quarter, because we got 65 of our NPC assets back. And the team was able to not only absorb the first quarter explorations, but make a dent and a pretty good one on those assets that were handed back in the NPC transaction. I am super comfortable with the team that we have and the asset management team that is led by TJ, they are a phenomenal group. And what we would like to be able to do is when we absorb VEREIT, is to be able to implement the same business model, which is a reason why we think we want to hold on to a lot of their folks and potentially share our business model with them, and tried to generate the same types of results that we've been able to generate on a standalone basis. That is another area that we can enhance through this combination. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then second question, how are you thinking about [Indiscernible] going forward? It's been mostly non-retail as of late. And even overall, it's a pretty small piece of O today about to get much smaller with the acquisition? Do you need to keep that to fulfill obligations to the customers? Does that go away? How should we be thinking? Does that - Is there a chance that that gets bigger going forward for you guys? Sumit Roy : Rob, I missed the key word, because there was a big beep. What is it that you said that we need to keep forward? And it's a very small part of our business? Rob Stevenson : The development business. Sumit Roy : It's that. Yeah. Rob Stevenson : It's mostly non-retail, and it's really even overall, a really small piece of O today, going to get much smaller. Do you grow that? Does that need to stay because of commitments to customers et cetera? How are you thinking about that business? Sumit Roy : Very good question. We hope to grow that business. It's about a $200 million business today. And you're absolutely right, that's not very large compared to the balance sheet that we have. But, some of the repositioning's I alluded to, some of the relationships that we have with existing industrial clients who want expansion capabilities, some of the relationships that we are developing with developers to provide a capital source, that could be a takeout, all of that is incredibly valuable to us. And I would love to see with a bigger platform, make this 3X 4X or what it is today, and being another contributor of value to our business. And so, we have a team that we have continued to grow, and through this combination, we will potentially grow this team even more, so that we can continue to enhance value going forward, even while just working on our own existing assets. And going back to your previous question working on vacant assets or soon to be vacant assets, and doing repositioning. That requires an enhanced expertise in the development front. So, we will certainly hold on to it and grow it. And potentially grow the allocation from where it is today. Rob Stevenson : Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Christie Kelly : Thanks Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Dilts from UBS. Brent Dilts : Hey guys. Just Sumit, following up on your \u2013 Christie Kelly : Hi Brent. Brent Dilts : Hey, Christine, how are you? Christie Kelly : Good. How are you, Brent? Brent Dilts : Doing great. Sumit, just following up on your comment earlier about the $4 billion in acquisitions. This year that you've seen some analysts write about I'm just curious, are you seeing anything in the market that could call the slowdown in the pace of your transaction activity in the near term? Just seems like you're on pace to well exceed the minimum 3.25 you guys got to do. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing there? Sumit Roy : Brent we are very optimistic. We, to be very honest with you, we are not seeing anything, we are obviously following some of the same rules coming out of DC and how it is going to have an impact et cetera. We are not seeing any of that translate into the volume being sourced. And our belief in not only meeting but potentially exceeding what we have shared with the market as our acquisition target. We started the year. And I think, Brent, if you recall, when we came into January, we shared with you what our pipeline looks like and how optimistic we were, that optimism has just continued to grow. So, we are super excited about not just the sheer volume but the quality that we are seeing and the quality that we are being able to get over the finish line. So, the platform is working. Brent Dilts : Okay, perfect. And then just digging into the transaction activity a little bit more. Could you talk about what you're seeing for some of the trouble tenant asset classes as reopening plays out and rent collection rates there improve. Are you seeing any of those assets starting to trade health and fitness, movie theaters, et cetera? Sumit Roy : Sure. We've certainly seen a couple of trades on the health and fitness side, especially with the more established operators. We've seen a few vacant assets on the theater side sell. So yes, people are getting much more optimistic about the future and are willing to buy vacant pieces of land with a building and reposition it. And that optimism is starting to filter in into the acquisition arena. But that's not an area that we play in. But it's certainly it's certainly something that's seen. Brent Dilts : Okay. Thank you. Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird. Wes Golladay : Hi, everyone. Sort of a few quick questions for you. Hi there, Christie. Looking at the industrial same store revenue, looks like it's been negative 40 basis points last year, and it continued into this year. Do you expect that to reflect later this year? Sumit Roy : Yeah, Wes, it's largely driven by this one asset that we had incorrectly calculated the CPI adjustment to it. And when we realized our mistake, and of course, we had collected rent on that. We went back to our clients and we shared with them that look, there was a mistake. And we gave them all - we readjusted the rent going forward. And that's really what you're starting to see play out. And so, obviously the client was incredibly happy about us coming out and sharing this information. But that's really what you're seeing play out. If you look at the actual leases on the industrial front, they have a lot more growth built into it than even our retail leases doing. So, the same store rent numbers should actually on a normalized basis, whereas I would expect it to go up. Not down. Wes Golladay : Gotcha. And then, made this early but I was curious about the potential office spin off how the capital structure would look and what that would mean for O's proforma leverage? Sumit Roy : We are absolutely focused on maintaining our A three A minus rating. And I believe the rating agencies came out and re-established, the ratings as well as the outlook post the announcement, we made last week and we are very much focused that proforma for the spend, we will continue to maintain ratings because even proforma for the spend, the proforma company is going to be close to $50 billion in size. And we'll have leverage metrics that is equivalent, if not better than what where we are today. So, it is super important for us to maintain our ratings. Wes Golladay : Got it. Thank you. Well. Operator : Your next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jeffries. Christie Kelly : Hi Linda. Linda Tsai : Hello, Christie. Hi, Sumit. Maybe following up on your earlier comment that you can handle and welcome large acquisition volumes. For this quarter you sourced $20 billion and invested in 5%. Does this 5% or $1 billion executed to $20 billion sourced ratio remain consistent post-merger? Sumit Roy : I hope it gets enhanced. I think I said this last week, and does that where VEREIT has been spending a fair amount of their time is not exactly 100% of an overlap of where we spend our time. So, we would like to be able to continue to leverage their platform and their ability to play in a zip code that we haven't spent a lot of time because, we're finding plenty of opportunities in the areas that we would really want to focus on. So, my hope is that pro forma for the combination, that the platform will increase in size and the area of focus will increase. And therefore, we might be able to create a trend line that is a step up from where we are today. But that is down the road. I want to stay focus on where we are today and the platform that we have currently. And if you look at the ratio of what gets closed versus what gets source, we have generally been in this 4% to 7%to 8% zip code for many quarters now. I mean, have there been quarters where those numbers may have been higher or slightly lower, perhaps, but it's generally in the zip code and we have the infrastructure to absolutely deal with that volume, and deal with getting our share of that volume over the finish line. And we haven't remained stagnant. That's the other point. I know, that's not very obvious from the outside, our team has grown. We have a complete platform now in the UK, which is in addition to the platform that we have in the U.S., which didn't exist. So, the platform has continued to grow, to absorb this higher volume of analysis that that is being asked of this team. So, so far, so good. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then my second question is with G&A at about 4.5%. Do you have a sense of how low this could go maybe a few years out post-merger? Sumit Roy : We talked about the G&A synergies in that $45 million to $50 million, and a cash synergy is in 35 to 40. I think there's some analysis that the team has done, where we show you that the journey to gross asset value potentially drops by one-third, going from 33 basis points to 23 basis points or 22 basis points. And, that is the goal. We absolutely believe in that, that the larger our platform becomes, the more scalable it is, and therefore it should translate to G&A numbers continuing to go down. But how far down does it go? I can't tell you. It's also going to be a function of, do we continue to add new swim lanes? If we do, we need the infrastructure to help support that. And if it keeps our G&A elevated, because we're still not reaching this normalized level of what this business and platform is capable of doing, I'm totally fine having a G&A in the course. But on a normalized level. If we have exhausted all possible swim lanes, then who knows that this thing can go? I don't have a precise answer for your Linda. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Christie Kelly : Hey, John. John Massocca : Good afternoon. How's it going? Sumit Roy : Good. How are you? John Massocca : Just a quick one from me, outside of office, how much roughly speaking of the VEREIT portfolio do you view as being a target for capital recycling as you look to manage the portfolio? Sumit Roy : I think I've answered this question in a different way, in terms of how much did we like the industrial and the retail portfolio that will be part of remain comp [ph] going forward? We don't see their makeup being largely different from ours, except in the areas that they've chosen to focus on. But the more we underwrote those industries and the actual operators that they have exposure to, the more comfortable we got that overall, this portfolio is one that we will be very proud to absorb. So, John, I don't have a precise answer. Could you see a corresponding increase in our capital recycling that we managed through disposition? You could, but that would be more of a function of the size of the platform has just increased rather than it getting disproportionately larger, because there's a lot more assets on their side that we would want to recycle that. Time will tell, but I suspect that it will be commensurate with what we are established as a standalone company today. John Massocca : Okay. All my other questions have been answered. So that's it for me. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Christie Kelly : Hey, Josh. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey Christie, hope you're doing well. Curious how you think about Europe now that you're a larger entity, just split the $2 billion mark over in UK. Are you thinking of kind of accelerating one of the portions to the rest of Europe at this time, or there are some other hurdles that you do look into [Indiscernible]? Sumit Roy : You know, Josh, that's a very good question. And I do want to answer it. What we were planning on doing on a standalone basis has absolutely not changed because of the announcement we made last week. I don't believe that it accelerates our desire to go into the rest of Europe, just because of this particular merger. Our desire to go to other geographies and other markets are largely being driven by our underwriting, our ability to absorb new markets, the team that we have in place, the maturity of our understanding of these various different markets. That's what's driving our desires. And so, yes, could we do more because the scale benefits of absorbing $15 billion platform? The answer is absolutely, yes. We can do more. And so, I think that's where the benefit comes. But I don't think, trying new things is triggered by the fact that we have a large platform off of which to try it. So, I just wanted to make that nuanced point, Josh. But it was a great question. And I'm glad you asked. Joshua Dennerlein : Great, I appreciate it. That's it from me. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Josh. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Harsh Hemnani from Green Street. Christie Kelly : Hi Harsh. Harsh Hemnani : Hi. Hey Sumit, you mentioned that you're looking to grow the development side of the business, as far as looking at the initial use on those this quarter, they were roughly equal the yields on acquisition. I'm just trying to understand the spread over your cost of capital that you see on the acquisition side versus what you're aiming towards on the development side long term. Sumit Roy : Yeah, Harsh, very good question. But again, it's a function of the mix, where the development dollars are going. If it is going towards industrial assets, which you will see that it is, the vast majority of the capital is going towards takeouts. And those cap rates, if they have a 5 in front of them, that's a great outcome. Because guess what happens once these assets are fully developed, and you go out into the open market, and you try to buy it from the open market, it potentially has a low 4s, even a 3 handled in front it. And that is the reason why we feel like yes, these cap rates, headline cap rates may look low. But if you really dive in behind the numbers, and you try to figure out what is the product that they're being able to get through this development funding, takeout funding, whatever you want to call it versus what could they buy the same particular asset, if it were available today, there is still 100 basis points, maybe 50 basis points, if you want to be conservative optimist, that we are getting by partnering with some of these very well-established global developers. So that's really where the value creation is. To answer your question more specifically what do I see the yield on development. If you look at retail, when you look at retail development, it depends on whether it's a repositioning or a Greenfield or what hasn't. On repositioning, that's where the maximum value creation occurs, we already have the piece of land, we go down the path of creating or repositioning an asset with the expectation that, you know, an AI through some of these numbers out at you that we could have ran compared to the privy positioning of 150, 200 even 300 - or 300 percentages of points. So that's the kind of uplift in value we could generate through this. Now that is a small portion of our business, a very small portion. But I just want to put in perspective that you see a blended number, but if you go behind the number there is a fair amount of value creation. And largely we want to be viewed as a one stop shop by our tenants who know us as landlords that hold assets for the long term. And if we can help them, harness our vacant asset portfolio by repositioning it for their needs. We want to be there to serve them. And that's the reason for having this. But in terms of how big is it going to become? What is the trend line going to look like? It's going to be a function of what dominates in that one given quarter. Harsh Hemnani : That's interesting. And then one more for me, on the debt synergies from the very first deal. Given that you have a lower cost of capital in the UK, could we expect to see a higher leverage ratio on your UK assets than in the U.S.? Sumit Roy : No, again, it goes back to our ratings Harsh. If you want a guiding principle, look at our balance sheet on a fully consolidated basis. And we want to be right down the fairway which keeps our rating agencies very happy. Yeah, that allows us the maximum flexibility to run our business. But we do not want to do anything that's going to compromise our A minus A 3 rating. Now, the mix of where that comes from, could absolutely change. A lot more of it could come from the UK, given the ARB between a tenuous Sterling denominated unsecured bond versus a U.S. unsecured bond. And we may choose again just to match fund our assets with locally denominated capital, we may choose to over lever some of those assets. But there is a threshold beyond which we are not going to go, even on a standalone basis. But yes, we can certainly have more of a mix coming from the UK given the lower cost there than the U.S. And then if you look at it on a fully consolidated basis, it's going to have the same profile that you would expect of an A 3 A minus rated company. I hope that answers your question. Harsh Hemnani : That's helpful. Thank you. Christie Kelly : Thanks, Harsh. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Well, thank you all for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with each of you soon. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income. Julie Hasselwander : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Building enduring relationships is inherent to our purpose as an organization, and I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I would like to express my appreciation to all of my Realty Income colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue our growth initiatives, while in the sustained remote work environment. We are pleased with the momentum across all facets of our business, which is reflected in our revised 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.53 to $3.59. Our increased guidance range represents an improvement of 2.7% at the midpoint compared to our prior range as well as an improvement of 5% at the midpoint versus last year and is a function of several tailwinds to our business : first, an increase to our 2021 acquisition volume guidance to approximately $4.5 billion; second, the continued improvement in rent collections from our theater clients; third, our well-priced capital markets activity since the start of June, which further positioned our balance sheet for continued growth; fourth, our active asset management activities, which resulted in occupancy of 98.5% at quarter-end and rent recapture rates in excess of 104% on lease expirations during the quarter; fifth, the overall quality of our portfolio, which has been curated, refined and underwritten over our 52-year history continues to perform throughout a variety of environments. We'll discuss each of these elements in greater detail shortly. Year-to-date, we have added approximately $2.2 billion of high-quality real estate to our portfolio, including $1.1 billion of new acquisitions in the second quarter. We continue to expand our platform as our size and scale remain key competitive advantages that translate directly into shareholder value. This quarter, we sourced more than $20 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. On a total revenue basis, approximately 54% of the acquisitions made during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment-grade client exposure to approximately 50%. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 11.5 years. The largest industry represented in our second quarter acquisitions was UK grocery stores, and 7-Eleven remains our largest client. We remain well diversified as our portfolio consists of over 6,700 assets leased to approximately 630 clients who operate in 58 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the UK And during the quarter, we continued to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 172 basis points while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. The quality of our acquisitions is evident throughout the entire life cycle of our portfolio as we have consistently demonstrated favorable recapture rates on expiring leases while maintaining a healthy occupancy level throughout a variety of economic cycles. During the quarter, we re-leased 58 units, recapturing 104.7% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,700 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on these re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter-end was 98.5% based on property count. Our international investment activities continue to support our growth outlook, and our UK portfolio has now grown to over $2.7 billion. This quarter, the UK accounted for over 50% of the $1.1 billion of total acquisitions only. Year-to-date, we've added approximately $1 billion in high-quality real estate in the UK across 41 properties. And of the more than $21 billion in acquisitions opportunity that we sourced, approximately 31% is related to international markets. As we continue to expand our international platform, we will look for additional geographies that offer opportunities similar to that of the UK. We seek to acquire real estate in markets where opportunities are abundant. There is considerable demand for sale-leaseback transactions from industry-leading operators, and the local real estate can generate long-term IRRs in excess of our long-term cost of cabin. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. At quarter-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.4x or 5.3x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. I would note that these ratios are before our $9.2 million share offering, which closed subsequent to quarter-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the second quarter in a row, coming in at 6.0x. And during the quarter, we raised over $457 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. Subsequent to quarter-end, we executed on two capital-raising activities to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In July, we raised approximately $594 million to an overnight equity offering. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term borrowings and support our active global investment pipeline. Additionally, in July, we issued our debut green bond, a \u00a3750 million multi-tranche denominated unsecured bond offering of 6 years and 12-year notes, priced at a combined all-in rate of 1.48% and a weighted average term of approximately 8.8 years. We're proud to be the first net lease REIT to demonstrate our commitment to our ESG initiatives with a green bond. This green bond creates further partnership opportunities with our clients to implement sustainable practices at the properties within our portfolio, providing support for environmentally conscious initiatives while achieving mutual sustainability goals. And we estimate that over 40% of the proceeds have already been allocated to existing green projects. More information about our green financing framework can be found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. This quarter, our business generated $0.88 of AFFO per share. And as Sumit mentioned, increasing greater rent collections are one of the drivers of our improved earnings outlook for 2021. In June, we collected approximately 51% of contractual theater rents. And in July, we collected 98.9% of our contractual theater rent. As a reminder, we own 79 total theater properties, which account for 5.4% of our annualized contractual rent. 42 of our theater assets are not on cash accounting, and we continue to recognize 100% of revenue on these assets on an accrual basis, consistent with our accounting treatment during the duration of the pandemic. The remaining 37 theater assets are currently on cash accounting, meaning we will not recognize any revenue associated with these clients until it has been received. These clients accounted for $34 million of annualized contractual rent or about $2.8 million of contractual rent per month. During the second quarter, we collected 38.3% of theater rent. The rent collections from June and July represented a significant improvement from prior periods. Our theater clients paid us 14% of contractual rent in the first quarter and an average of 31% in April and May. Assuming the pace of collections we recognize to the theater industry in July continues on through the remainder of the year, we would not expect to accrue any additional theater reserves going forward. We believe the increased rent collections reflect significant positive momentum in the theater industry. One after another, the latest blockbusters continue to demonstrate a return to normalcy for the theater industry. In mid-July, opening weekend of Black Widow brought in approximately $158 million in revenue globally, earning the record for the biggest opening weekend since the pandemic. We are cautiously optimistic the momentum we're seeing will continue while closely monitoring the COVID-19 variants. As a monthly dividend company, our mission is to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. In July, we declared our 613th consecutive monthly dividends, and we have now increased the dividend 111x since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result, it's increasing the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We're proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only three REITs and 65 companies overall. Now I would like to hand our call back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christie. Before we open up the line for questions, I did want to provide a brief update on our pending merger with VEREIT. Our special shareholder meeting to approve the merger is scheduled for August 12, and we remain focused on the fourth quarter closing, subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. As I hope you can all appreciate, we are limited in any incremental information we can provide related to the merger beyond what has already been publicly disclosed. In conclusion, we are energized and pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business, which is reflected in our updated earnings guidance and increased growth projections for the year. As we have proven, with greater size comes enhanced prospects for growth, and we look forward to continuing to execute on these initiatives to ultimately deliver favorable full cycle AFFO per share growth with minimal volatility. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Nate Crossett : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to just touch on activity in the quarter and kind of the outlook for the year. Maybe you could kind of give some color on the mix of the deal flow in the quarter and what you're seeing for the balance of the year? How is it weighting industrial versus retail? Are there a number of portfolio deals in there? And then, if you could just touch on what you're seeing in terms of pricing, both in the U.S. and the UK. And then also, I was curious here if you had looked at any transactions in Continental Europe yet. Sumit Roy : Nate, thank you for your questions. So I hope to attempt to answer all of them, but I might miss a few. In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out with a very robust pipeline. We've already sourced year-to-date more than $40 billion. And clearly, at the run rate that we've been able to achieve over the last three quarters and year-to-date, you can have a sense for the robustness of the pipeline. And I think the biggest surprise for us has been our -- the volume that we've been able to generate in the UK, some of which sort of translated to what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter. But even if you look year-to-date, it's representing about 40% of acquisitions. And the quality of the product that we're continuing to see, the relationships that we've been able to establish and grow in the UK during a very short period over the last two years is a testament to why we feel very comfortable with having increased our acquisition guidance by another $1.25 billion given that we are clipping away at $1 billion. So in terms of the pipeline, we are very happy with what we are seeing. We are very comfortable with the product that we are seeing. And I think this is -- this trend is going to continue. In terms of the makeup, you might have seen that depending on the quarter, anywhere between 25% to 30% of what we are acquiring is industrial. In the second quarter, 15% of overall acquisition was industrial, largely driven by about 35% industrial in the U.S. And we -- again, on the relationship front have been able to make a fair amount of progress, are seeing acquisition opportunities, sometimes before it even hits the market and being able to try to get some of these transactions over the finish line with the relationships that we have developed. And I think you should expect to see this 15% to 25% of our volume coming from the industrial side of the equation in terms of asset type continue over the next few quarters. In terms of cap rate, look, it's a very aggressive market. I think in previous calls, I've mentioned that cap rates have continued to compress, tighten whatever the right word is. And it's -- I think it's a testament to certainly the type of products that we are pursuing, but more so to the fact that net lease is a very unique way of investing in real estate that is very specific. And as such, for the type of products that we pursue, we have continued to see cap rates compress. And by the way, this is across the spectrum on the credit curve. It's not just on the investment-grade side. In fact, I'd argue on the investment-grade side, the compression has been more muted on a relative basis versus what we have seen on the high-yield side of the equation. So -- and that trend is continuing, and we saw that in the second quarter as well. I believe on the industrial front, it has continued to tighten, but it has -- the speed with which it's tightening has certainly slowed down. And we're seeing products on the industrial side for well-located assets in the high 3% cap rate, low 4% ZIP code to, on the rare occasion, high 4%, low 5% ZIP code depending on location. On the retail side, it's a similar story for high-quality assets with long lease terms, good growth, you're seeing in the low 4% to low 5% ZIP code. And then if you're willing to compromise on lease term or growth rates or what have you, perhaps credit, you can see transactions transacting in the mid-5% to low 7% ZIP code. But the stuff that one buys in the high 6s, low 7%, that has credit profiles, lease terms, et cetera, that obviously has a much higher risk profile associated to it. So I don't know if I got all your questions in, Nate, but please let me know if I missed something. Nate Crossett : No, I think that's good. I'm just also curious, have you guys looked at any transactions on Continental Europe yet? Sumit Roy : Yes. Thank you. We certainly have, and this is something that I have touched on in some of my previous calls. We just haven't been able to get some of these transactions over the finish line, but we are very close. The success that we have accomplished in the UK is one that we are trying to mimic in similar geographies with similar risk profiles. And with every day, every week that goes by, we are getting ever so close to being able to report to you additional markets that we've been able to add, which will become incremental source of growth for our business. But the direct answer to your question is, yes, we continue to look at opportunities, and we've come pretty close, but haven't been able to get them all the finish line as of the end of the second quarter. Nate Crossett : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Nate. Christie Kelly : Thanks, Nate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Christie Kelly : Hi, Caitlin. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. You historically mentioned one of the reasons the announced VEREIT is attractive is that by being larger, you can do some larger transactions without risking concentration increasing meaningfully. I think you referenced it again in the prepared remarks. So I also imagine that those kinds of deals take time to complete. I was wondering if you could comment on what the opportunity set is for something like that and how frequently you expect a deal of that nature could come up in the future. Is it something that could be like once a year or maybe never even happen? Just trying to understand how realistic something like that could be. Sumit Roy : Yes. That's a very good question, Caitlin. Look, in terms of predicting what can happen in the future, some of what you see is publicly available. You have seen some large companies come out and say as part of their financing, sale leaseback is going to be a source of capital, and they've come out with multibillion dollar numbers. And those are the ones that are obvious, both you've seen that here in the U.S. and you've seen that in the UK as well, with some of the M&A work that happened and large sale-leaseback opportunities on the industrial front in one specific transaction in the UK and then there was a retail client here in the U.S. that has come out with something like that. But I think what we would like to be able to change is to proactively go and be a solution for transactions that may not be in the public eye. And given the fact that we will have the size and scale, it is more difficult for me to predict as to how many of those opportunities can we create. When you talk to large companies and you go in there and you say, \"Oh, we can do -- we can take $1 billion of your real estate off the balance sheet.\" Sometimes that's not meaningful enough to engage in a conversation. I mean, here, we are talking about $70 million, $80 million, $100 million companies, and that sort of capital doesn't really move the needle for them. And so what we are very optimistic about is to be able to use our pro forma on larger scale to be able to have more aggressively some of these conversations that we started a few years ago. And the feedback that we had received was, oh, yes, thanks a lot, just not big enough for us to be meaningful to engage. And so I think those conversations, we hope to get over the finish line and create more opportunities. But Catlin, I can't sit here and tell you that there will be one or two of those transactions per year. I think we have to view those where we are generating those transactions on our own as opportunistic. And time will tell as to how many of those we can sort of get over the finish line. But even if you were to just look at the ones that are not opportunistic, the ones that are part of M&A capital strategies, you're starting to see a lot more today than you ever did in the past. And I've just referenced two transactions in the recent, call it, five months, six months period. I'm not trying to suggest that you should extrapolate that. But those types of transactions didn't see the light of day three years ago, four years ago. And so that's what gives us confidence that being a larger company will allow us to more proactively take advantage of these opportunities that present themselves and be that one-stop shop, which even with our current size, we sometimes fall short. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. And then maybe just talking about on the tenant side, retailer bankruptcies have been pretty limited this year. Could you give some detail on the status of your watch list or maybe just more generally, your understanding of how your tenants are doing today? Sumit Roy : Yes. Our watch list stands right around 4% currently, Caitlin. And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%. And some could argue over that 99% may have built in a lot of abatements and a reduction in rent that you might have passed on to clients. And I just want to make sure that we make it very clear that it doesn't. I mean, if you look at the numbers, and we've put this out publicly, if you look at the abatement number, it's about slightly more than $1 million on $1.6 billion of rent. So it's about 90 basis points is what we have -- not even actually, it's a lot less than that, what we have updated, and these are largely to smaller operators. So when we are collecting above 99% on rent that has largely not been abated, it's very similar to what we had pre-COVID that should be a testament to the credit profile of the tenants that we are exposed to, and that is by design. So we feel very good about where we are and especially with every month that goes by this continued optimism that we have in our ability to get back to pre-pandemic levels without having to give abatements, I think, is a testament to the credit quality of our operators. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Katie McConnell with Citi. Katie McConnell : Now that your theater collections are becoming much more stabilized, can you talk about your approach to converting cash basis tenants back to the accrual method eventually and how we should think about potential timing of that? Sumit Roy : Sure. Katie, if you wouldn't mind, I'll have Christie talk to that. Christie Kelly : Certainly. Thanks, Sumit. Thanks, Katie. So essentially, Katie, we have very positive momentum as we've discussed in our theater industry collections. And as we look forward towards the end of the year, there are a couple of things that we're really watching. And first is going to be collection experience, and that is sustained and in accordance with our contractual and any deferral agreement. Second is in relation to that experience going into not only the third quarter but the fourth quarter to ensure that we have consistency, that we maintain momentum on collections and that we're able to report the 98% to 100% collections that we're expecting going forward with no additional reserves. And so CBD, we're booking and looking and reviewing as part of our routine every week, every month, and we'll have more to report after the third quarter. Katie McConnell : Okay. Got it. And then could you discuss how your G&A needs could change in international markets of the UK portfolio continues to grow and as you start thinking about entering some new markets? Sumit Roy : Sure. So Katie, part of the strategy we had was to use a combination of folks that we had in-house and some companies that we felt very comfortable with outsourcing to as third-party providers for services that we needed. And obviously, if we -- as our portfolio has grown and now it's about $2.7 billion in the UK, a lot of these third-party providers provide services that we can accommodate internally at margins that are superior to what we were getting outsourcing those particular functions. So as we have grown, we are bringing in-house more and more of these services. One of the other things that we are trying to look at and consider is as we grow into additional markets, and we believe that to be a matter of time, where is it that we should be domiciled, et cetera? And that work has -- we've made a tremendous amount of progress on that front as well. So before we bring in some of these functions in-house, we wanted to make sure that we were structured appropriately to accommodate our continued growth in Europe. And so there will be more to come on that front, but we will certainly be able to create synergies by bringing some of these outsourced services in-house. And it's largely going to be a function of where we ultimately decide to be headquartered to help support the European expansion. And -- but those discussions are ongoing, and we'll have more to report on that front as and when we establish our operations, et cetera. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : I want to talk about UK a little bit more. So the investment spread there is wider than what you've been able to achieve in the U.S. Is that just a function of plus competition? And then what are your thoughts on increasing your investment focus on that market since you started investing there, maybe targeting a higher percentage of UK versus U.S. asset than initially thought of? Sumit Roy : So Greg, part of it was, if you looked at the first quarter, we were in the low 5s in terms of what we were able to accomplish in the UK It's a function of the asset types that we are able to get over the finish line as well as some of the operators that we pursue, the lease term, et cetera, et cetera. And we were hoping to actually close on a few transactions that were slightly more higher yielding in the first quarter that slipped into the second quarter, which is the primary reason for this higher cap rate. In terms of competition, every day that goes by, I'm exaggerating, of course, the competition in the UK is increasing. I think people have started to realize that, that is a market that affords good risk-adjusted returns. And so I don't see competition as being the dictate as to whether we should increase, decrease the quantum of transactions that we pursue in the UK. We have a very defined -- clearly defined strategy in the UK And if there are transactions that we see, if they meet those particular criteria, we pursue it and we pursue it aggressively. And I think that's what's going to dictate the amount of volume. Now clearly, the volume has increased, and part of it is because it took us a while to establish ourselves, establish our name and establish those -- the reputation that we have and the relationships that we've built. But if there are opportunities and more opportunities to -- if the volume of opportunities increase, you can totally see us increasing the amount of acquisitions that we get over the finish line in the UK But we're going to be very true to our strategy that we laid out, and that's not to say it's a static strategy that doesn't get looked at, and it doesn't get added to or subtracted from. It's just something that we spend a lot of time first figuring out what is the right product to pursue and then react to that strategy that we have thoughtfully laid out for ourselves. So it could be volume of acquisitions increase as more and more products start to come to the fourth. For sure, it could. Is competition increasing? Yes. But I think the way for us to think about our international strategy is to think in terms of newer markets to continue to add to the volume of overall acquisitions, not necessarily do more in a given location. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And then to help us better understand the hurdles to additional investment opportunities in Europe, what enables you to more quickly accomplish the goal of finding significant investment opportunities in the UK getting those deals across the finish line in Continental Europe? Sumit Roy : Part of it was pricing. It got so aggressive. These were transactions that met a lot of our strategic objectives that we had laid out. But there's just a lot of capital that is chasing these deals, like I said. And when it got to a point where it didn't make economic sense for us to continue to pursue, we backed away. And I think that has largely been the reason why we haven't sort of gotten into some of the other markets. But I will say that as we have become more visible in given geographies, just like we did in the UK, people are getting familiar with our names. And so there might have been transactions that we might not have seen two years ago or 1.5 years ago, that we are now seeing because people understand that we -- they understand what we were able to do in the UK That reputation has translated to Continental Europe. And the fact that we have pursued a few transactions has obviously led credence to our ability and our desire to grow our portfolio in those particular markets. And I think that is translating into the flow that you need to get into to establish a particular market. And so we are very optimistic that over the next few quarters, you will start to see us expand into other markets outside of the UK Greg McGinniss : All right. If you won't mind, just a quick follow-up there based on that response. Are you -- is it fair to say that you're seeing more competition than in Continental Europe versus the UK? Sumit Roy : I wouldn't say it's more than in the UK What I would say is the pricing could be the folks -- the capital markets environment in Continental Europe versus the UK is different. And that translates into a more aggressive pricing environment at times. And so, we're going to be very disciplined at, Greg. And if we don't feel like it makes sense on a risk-adjusted basis, we are not going to pursue it just for the sake of expanding into new markets. But having said all of that, I'm very optimistic about being able to add to our UK expansion in the near term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Just wanted to go back to the UK cap rates, the jump that we saw there in the past quarter. I'm curious did you enter any new markets within the UK, like, say, Scotland? And then maybe can you comment on what the expectation should be near term? Or how are you thinking about cap rates in the UK near term? Will it be closer to 5% like last quarter or 6% perhaps closer to the new norm? Sumit Roy : Yes. So Haendel, when you say UK, we've been looking at transactions in Scotland, Wales and England. Those are the three countries that we focused on. So the fact that we have closed on a particular transaction, and I don't recall off the top of my head whether we did or we didn't, is not new. We -- from the time we've gone into the UK, we've been looking at all three countries -- not Northern Island yet, just to be clear. The cap rate is really a function of what gets closed in a given quarter handle. As you know, the industrial market is trade at lower cap rates, especially if it has the lease term, et cetera. And it's a similar story on the retail front as well. Perhaps it's slightly higher than the industrial side, but not that much higher, especially if it has lease term and it's with one of the top three operators, top four operators on the grocery side of the business. So it really is a question of whether it's industrial or retail. Within retail, is it grocery or home improvement? What is the duration of the lease term? All of that goes into the mix to define what the cap rate is. And yes, within the three countries as well, there is a slight discrepancy in terms of cap rates, what a similar asset would trade in Scotland versus in England. But it's a function of all of those various factors that go into what the cap rate is for a given transaction. And we have, like I have said before, a very clearly defined strategy. And depending on what gets over the finish line that translates to the cap rates that we've shared. So this particular quarter, it was about 6%. And in the first quarter, it was in the low 5s. So it blended out to -- in the mid to high 5% cap rates, which I think is what one should expect going forward. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Appreciate that. And one more, just again, fully understanding there's a lot of sensitivity regarding matters pertaining to the merger, the pending merger with VEREIT. But there's been some confusion amongst the number of users we talked to you about the 10% accretion target you outlined for the merger. So maybe can you just clarify for us the 10% accretion. Is that before or after the office portfolio spin-off that you're doing concurrently with the merger? Sumit Roy : Yes. The 10% is the overall system accretion. It is inclusive of the office assets. It's inclusive of the entire company. And that's the extent of the comments I'm going to make. I think you can look at the investor deck that we had put out that walks you through the mechanics of what that 10% really entails. But if you look at these two companies and you have one company buying another company, what is the accretion, it's 10%. That's how you should think about it, actually, not 10%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just two quick ones for me. The first, I think you talked about historically in the past, given how well the portfolio did during COVID that there was potential to look at maybe higher-yielding, slightly higher risk assets on the acquisition side. Just curious what -- is that still something that you guys are thinking about in bringing the strategy? Is that still something that's being contemplated? Sumit Roy : Ronald, yes, it's absolutely part and parcel of our strategy. We play across the risk spectrum and the credit spectrum. And so just because something is high yielding doesn't necessarily always mean that it has risk associated with it, for which you are not getting paid. But we don't find those very often. I'll also go ahead and say that. And -- but if we do, and it just happens to have a high 6% cap rate associated with it, and the fact that we have certain competencies on our asset management and leasing side of the equation, which we believe are true competencies that are -- that make us based on some of the results that we've shared, we feel a lot better about being able to pursue those opportunities. And the more assets that we reposition, et cetera, the better we are able to underwrite some of the risk that's inherent in the high-yielding opportunities that we see. And so as we continue to build on our competency of repositioning assets and being able to generate spreads that are north of what the existing spreads were, I think we will look at more higher-yielding opportunities. But it's -- they don't come very often, but it's certainly part of our strategy, Ronald. Ronald Kamdem : And then the second question was just going back, I think you talked a little bit about cap rate compression in the sort of both in the industrial as well as in the retail. So maybe just can you, again, compare and contrast. Obviously, industrial has been sort of very competitive. It sounds like the cap rate compression has moderated relative to the retail. Just curious if those comments are captured accurate, if you can provide a little bit more color there? Sumit Roy : So Ronald, it's a long -- the range of cap rates that I've shared with you that we are seeing in the market on assets that we are pursuing, I do think that where we have seen compression, the retail assets continue to compress more today than the industrial assets. But we hear stories of certain transactions that happen at cap rates that we've never seen before, but I would consider that to be one-off. But it is a question of a lot of capital chasing the same set of products that we find ourselves interested in. And that has resulted in the environment that we find ourselves. Having said all of that, we are still generating -- in the second quarter, we generated over 170 basis points in spread, which is better than our average spread over the duration of our history of acquiring assets. So even in this environment, we are very competitive and we are able to grow our portfolio and generate above average spreads. So we feel very good about where we are. But I don't think that it's a sustainable environment where cap rates continue to compress, especially if it's -- funny I say this, but the 10 year trading in the 1 15, 1 16 ZIP Code, but where the expectation is that inflation should come in and interest rates at some point will start to go back up, I think that's going to be the floor for this continued compression. But we are starting to see some level of stabilization, certainly on the industrial side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS. Brent Dilts : In the transaction market for theater assets, are you seeing any buyers up here yet or any sellers actively marketing properties as rent collection rates improve? We saw the recent AMC deal for the two Pacific theater properties, but just wondering more broadly what you're seeing in the market there? Sumit Roy : I think, Brent, what AMC was able to do is largely along the lines of what their CEO has suggested to the market that they now are sitting on plenty of capital where they can play offense and where they see opportunities with assets that are well located but the operator is no longer there or is in a distressed situation, they're going out and buying out the operators. And that I think is very prudent. We haven't been in the market trying to sell our assets or anything like that. We had a thesis that we have shared with you and with the market about the theater business as an industry. We've also shared with you that the assets that we believe we have tend to be very well located and in terms of performance are in the top two quartiles a vast majority of our assets. And so our expectations have always been that this business will come back and we will start to collect 100% of our rent, and that our operators will start to pay back some of the deferred rent, which in one case has already started. But I did see some news around assets having traded and I think it might have been one of our peer companies that sold a couple of layer assets. But we really are not playing in the market rent. For us, it was more of about in the off chance that we do get some of these assets back, how can we reposition them. And I think I've made comments in the past around our confidence in being able to reposition some of these assets just given their location and given the demand for alternative use. But we haven't been looking to buy more assets nor have we been looking to sell any of our theater asset. So can't really comment on that outside of what I saw in the press. Brent Dilts : And then just a clarification maybe on the guidance for this year. Does the revision for your guidance -- could you just clarify what is assumed on the recovery of deferred rents from the theater tenants versus your prior assumptions? Sumit Roy : We haven't changed -- yes, go ahead, Christie\u2026 Christie Kelly : I was just going to say that as it relates to the guidance, Brent, essentially, we're expecting as we move forward that we continue to incur and experienced positive rent collections similar to the trends that we've been seeing increased through the second quarter and consistent with the experience in July. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : I apologize, another cap rate question, but in terms of the larger sale leasebacks for retail and industrial. How do the cap rates on these deals compare to your regular one-off acquisitions? Sumit Roy : Well, we haven't really seen one of those larger transactions here in the US actually transact, so I can't really comment on that, Linda. But traditionally, we had always seen a discount on the portfolio transactions vis-a-vis what you see in the one-off market. And my expectation would be that in order to facilitate multibillion dollar sale leaseback transactions that that discount will continue to be there vis-a-vis the one-off markets, but time will tell. We certainly have seen a compression on that discount but I believe that there will have to be a discount in order for an institutional buyer like ourselves to continue to engage. Otherwise, what's the difference? We could pick these assets off in the one-off market and we certainly have the infrastructure to do that. So that's my belief. Linda Tsai : And then you discussed before the superior cost of capital in the UK versus the US. What's the differential like currently and do you view it as sustainable? Sumit Roy : So I mean, on the cost of equity, obviously, it's the same. It's really the cost of debt that we see a major difference. You saw what we were able to do on the green bond issuance. I think it priced out at about 1.48% all in. If we were to do a similar issuance here in the US, I think the delta would be 30 to 40 basis points, maybe even larger. Now obviously, the environment today is very different from when we went to the market. But nevertheless, I saw a quote not just too long ago on a 10 year unsecured bond, it was 1.95, 1.98. And we got August, a nine year weighted average on the bond issuance that we just did, and that was at 1.48. So yes, that 50 basis point delta continues to be there. And that's really the advantage that we have, that we have assets, that could be financed with capital being raised locally. And so that's where the cost of capital advantage comes in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. John Massocca : So I guess touching back on the industrial investment platform again. And did I hear you correctly, it seems like at the beginning of the call, you were kind of indicating that maybe you're looking to -- I know you've historically always been in industrial, but maybe you can further grow that platform? And if so, I mean, how has your kind of underwriting on industrial assets changed over the years? I mean, maybe this is a misconception on my part, but I've always kind of thought of your industrial investments being primarily kind of high investment grade rated tenants on long kind of lease term. Has there been any push into areas that maybe have shorter duration leases, maybe some of the more, I guess, less name brand tenants in an industrial asset? Just anything on that front and how that platform is evolving. Sumit Roy : So John, I think we've been asked this question around our industrial portfolio and what is the allocation that we would like to see in an optimal portfolio, and we've said circa 20%. Today, we are right around 12%. So our desire is to grow that asset type to the 20% ZIP code. So I don't think your question is around why are we doing it. I think you prefaced your question by saying we have been in industrial. So I think that hasn't changed. Obviously, as we have underwritten industrial assets now for over 10 years, I think our first investment was in 2010, 2011 time frame We have evolved in terms of being able to take on assets that may have only nine years left on a lease rather than what we used to feel comfortable around doing 10 years ago, which was 15 year leases or 20 year leases and potentially doing it only through the sale leaseback channels rather than providing capital for takeouts, et cetera. And so clearly, on the lease term, we are very comfortable taking on high single digit, mid single digit lease terms, if we can get very comfortable with the market and inherent rent and what the price per square feet is for given assets and what the market can looks like on future rental growth, as well as alternative tenants that could step in. And if that allows us to pursue some transactions, we will absolutely do that. We are very proud of our industrial asset management team. And we share with you the renewals and the releases that we have on a blended basis. And those types of numbers have continued to give us confidence to grow our business and to grow our platform, and to bring in more and more people along with the team that we already have. That's very comfortable playing across the lease term, playing across the credit spectrum, et cetera. Having said all of that, we are still predominantly investment grade. But we are very comfortable playing across the credit spectrum on the industrial side, if we believe it's well located with good real estate metrics associated with it. John Massocca : And then on the balance sheet side, obviously, the UK debt issuance was a green bond. I guess maybe kind of both in the UK and in the US, what's the opportunity set there for more kind of green bond issuance? And I guess what are the advantages essentially from a pricing perspective versus the non-green bond. Sumit Roy : Christie? Christie Kelly : Essentially, one of the aspects of green bond is there is some slight, if you will, favorability associated with the overall rate. I mean based on our research and tracking, it's about 10 basis points, but it's really more than that. It's really about making a statement as it relates to our ESG initiatives and as well, putting a framework out there that really allows us to partner with our clients and doing the right thing as we focus on reducing our carbon footprint. And as we go forward, yes, green bond is something that we're interested in. One of the things that we had talked about in our prepared remarks is the fact that the bond that we executed have about 40% fulfillment as it relates to real estate that meets the criteria. We're focused on completing that, not only with acquisitions that we execute in the UK and eventually potentially on the continent, but also in the US. And we think it's a great vehicle for us to move forward with not only from a liability management perspective and driving competitive weighted average cost of capital, but as I mentioned before, just doing the right thing, allowing us to partner in the right way with our clients to make a difference. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Chris Lucas : So Sumit, just a couple of quick questions for you. Just on the merger with VEREIT. Can you just give us a sense of what are the hurdles left to get through and maybe the expected timing? You mentioned the shareholder vote next week. I'm assuming there's other things that need to get done that push the expected completion date sometime fourth quarter. Sumit Roy : So Chris, I'm very limited and constrained in terms of what I can talk about with respect to the merger. All I can tell you is we are right on schedule. One of the biggest hurdles, as you said, is our shareholder vote next week on the 12 -- well, it's on August 12. And then we -- if you look at our agreements, et cetera, I think you'll see a couple of other conditions that have been laid out, but we feel very comfortable, and we are on schedule so far. So I think by the third quarter, we'll have a lot more to share with you. And so if I can just ask you to be a bit patient, a bit more patient, I'd appreciate it. Chris Lucas : And then I guess just on the significant bump in acquisition guidance. Is there any large portfolio transactions that are embedded in that number that we should be aware of? Sumit Roy : No, Chris. Nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a very healthy pipeline. It's exactly the type of product that you would expect Realty Income to pursue. So no large portfolios are part of this guidance. Chris Lucas : And then last question and maybe for Christie, just on the significant ramp in theater rent collections. Was there anything in your relationship with them that sort of drove that or was it just as random as they just decided to pay you in July\u2026 Christie Kelly : As you can imagine, Chris, we're in close contact with our theater clients and have been so since the beginning of the pandemic and even beyond that. But as you've seen, I mean their liquidity position has improved significantly. Essentially, all theaters are open. And with that, we've had some great results at the box office. So that's all translating to improved collections together with the fact that we hold essentially the best assets. And so with that, we're working in partnership. We expect to be paid in full, as Sumit said, from the abatement activity, et cetera, very immaterial and nothing in relation to our theater clients. And moving forward, we are continuing to partner. We're focused on getting paid in full and that's the manner in which we're going forward. So nothing magic [Multiple Speakers]\u2026 Chris Lucas : Last question for me, just on the deferral repayment schedule. Have you guys outlined sort of what the cadence of that is expected to be? Christie Kelly : I think we've talked about it in general, Chris. And suffice it to say that as it relates to deferrals, we're not at liberty to talk about any one client. But overall, I can explain to you our strategy and essentially, it's to get paid back in full here in the near term. Essentially, any of our deferral arrangements are spanning, call it, a year to 18 months out. We're expected to get paid back in terms of average deferral period within seven months. And as a matter of fact, some of our clients are paying us back early. And so overall, great job done by the team and again, good partnership with our clients. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Spenser Allaway : As it relates to dispositions in the quarter, most of your asset sales were vacant assets. So can you just comment on the market for these assets? And would you say it's harder to offload your vacant assets today than it was pre-COVID, just given the additional headwinds in the market? Sumit Roy : Spencer, actually, again, it's the exact opposite. If you look at the second quarter and you look at the resolutions, we were able to pick up 50 basis points essentially from where we were in terms of occupancy at the end of the first quarter versus the second quarter from 98% to 98.5%. It's largely a testament to what we were able to do on the asset sales side and these are vacant asset sales. I think we had close to 40 resolutions on that front. And then if you look at what the return profile has been, it continues to be year-to-date in that 8% plus unlevered returns. So I think it again goes back to where we buy assets, how fungible are these assets. If not for retenanting purposes to sell it vacant and still be able to capture returns that are well in excess of our long-term weighted average cost of capital. So we've been very successful and part of it is a testament to the team that we have in place. And we haven't seen any drop off, in fact, during this COVID-related downturn that we are coming out of. And I would go so far as to say that our speed, our ability to execute more transactions has continued to increase quarter-over-quarter. So that's the reason why we are so proud of being able to get to 98.5% despite suffering NPC's bankruptcy in the fourth quarter where we were handed back 70 odd assets, and we were able to get right back to that 98.5% ZIP code within two quarters. So we feel very good about our team and our ability to continue to take advantage of the market. Spenser Allaway : And it looks like you sold at least one office asset. Can you just comment on that property type in the market for those assets right now, and especially for assets with low lease term? Sumit Roy : I don't want to speak to specifics, Spencer, because we have NDAs, et cetera. But rest assured that was an asset where if we had discussions with the tenant and it was deemed better to sell it back and move forward. And again, on that particular asset, our overall return profile was well in advance of what we captured for the second quarter. So we feel very good about those opportunistic sales. There is no secret. We've already mentioned that we are not in -- I mean, office is not a long term asset type that we want to be exposed to. And we get these one-off opportunities to take advantage of them. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Elvis Rodriguez with Bank of America. Elvis Rodriguez : Just a quick one on strategy. Sumit, as you think about acquiring these larger portfolios and the sale leaseback deals, how do you think about like the assets you want to keep versus the assets you want to shed in terms of spinning them out versus an outright sale? Sumit Roy : So Alves, that's part of what we do across our portfolio pretty much on a daily basis. It's not just when we are buying large sale leaseback transactions. I mean, obviously, we are somewhat constrained being a REIT. You have holding period requirements, et cetera. But in the past, when we have done large sale leasebacks or larger sale leasebacks, there were some assets that we bought into our TRS primarily with the intent of managing our exposure to the tenant. And so that has always been part of our strategy and will continue to be part of our strategy going forward. So nothing new there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : Just a quick follow-up again. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. So there was a lot of movement on the convenience store side of things this quarter with 7-Elevens, Circle-K, [BWA] and GPM kind of shifting around top tenant list. Just curious there were maybe some trades between those tenants, that was impacting that. And then in terms of increasing exposure to 7-Eleven, was that a deal that maybe you may not have pursued without the pending VEREIT merger or are you comfortable with 6% exposure to certain tenants? Sumit Roy : Well, not too long ago, we had 7% exposure to Walgreens. And now as you noticed, Greg, that has, over time, dwindled down to 7.5%. The biggest movement on the 7-Eleven transaction was that they closed on their Speedway transaction. And you might recall, we used to have, I don't know how many assets, but we were exposed to Speedway. And so once they closed on it, it's obviously now under 7-Eleven and that's what shows an increase in the 7-Eleven tenant client exposure. Then you might have noticed that on the Circle K, Couche-Tard side that went lower, and it's primarily because they sold some of the assets that were our assets to KC. And so that's the reason for some of the Couche-Tard concentration to be reduced from what you had seen in the previous quarter. So that's really what's happening. It's not us going out and doing transactions or what have you. Having said that, if transactions were to be available, we would absolutely pursue it. And we are very comfortable with individual clients representing 6%, 7%, not across the board but for certain clients, we are absolutely very comfortable with that. And 7-Eleven is definitely one of them. Greg McGinniss : And just a final one for me kind of following up on Spencer's question on dispositions. So past quarter was, I guess, the largest number of vacant dispositions in years. Was that just due to the NPC vacancies or is there any other particular tenant or industry type for those assets? And then any color you can provide on the re-leasing or repositioning attempts on those assets would be appreciated as well, because obviously, you showed success in the other re-leasing numbers this quarter. Sumit Roy : So Greg, this is part of our asset management strategy. Obviously, we are very comfortable holding on to assets. It's not like we are trying to manage to an occupancy number. But there is an analysis that we go through figuring out what is the holding cost, what is the re-leasing scenario look like, how long is that going to take, is there going to be capital contribution, are we better off selling it for whatever it is that we are able to get, what's the return profile looks like in a re-leasing scenario versus a sale scenario today. And once you look at the mix, you pursue a particular strategy, and that's largely what's driving the decision making process. And what we found was, yes, that some of the assets that we sold actually were the bankrupt assets that we got back from NPC. They were in high demand but not for re-lease. They were in high demand with folks that wanted to buy these assets outright. And when you look at the return profile, it was superior to us holding it and trying to find a new client that could step into those assets. Having said that, there are some assets that we actually re-leased to new clients as well. So it's a combination of strategies that we execute but the underlying premise and the goal has always been what is going to maximize our returns and whatever that answer is that it's selling it vacant versus finding a new tenant, that's dictated by this return profile. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Well, thank you very much, and I look forward to coming back to you shortly. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income. You may begin your conference. Julie Hasselwander : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income, Third Quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law.  The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a 2-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call-in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Our strong relationships with all our stakeholders enabled the success of our business, and we thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation of our expanded Realty Income team for their tireless efforts in executing on our strategic objectives. Today, our business is at an inflection point, where the advantages of our growing size and scale, provide us an accelerating number of opportunities, compounding our aptitude for growth. We see momentum accelerating across all facets of our business as a result of the following growth catalysts : 1. the depth and breadth of our active global pipeline remains robust. During the third quarter, we acquired over $1.6 billion of real estate across 3 countries resulting in approximately $3.8 billion year-to-date.  We now expect to invest in over $5 billion of real estate in 2021. an increase from our prior guidance of $4.5 billion. Second, we believe our expansion into Continental Europe during the third quarter with significantly deepen our addressable market at attractive spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. Particularly given the comparatively low unsecured borrowing rates in the European bond market.  Third, our asset management activities continue to generate strong results, at the end of the third quarter, our portfolio was 98.8% occupied. And we achieved a rent recapture rate of 107.2%, illustrating the relentless efforts of our asset management team and highlighting the quality of our real estate. And finally, with the closing of the VEREIT merger, we believe our size, scale and diversification will further enhance many of our competitive advantages which we suspect should allow us to augment our investment activities in the future.  The closing upon merger with VEREIT, as well as the anticipated and subsequent spin-off of substantially all the combined Company's office properties, which has previously announced is expected to be completed on November 12, allows us to provide enhanced clarity on our near-term earnings run rate. To that end, we are increasing our 2021 AFFO per share guidance to $3.55 to $3.60 representing 5.5% annual growth at the midpoint.  And we're introducing 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97% representing 9.2% annual growth at the midpoint. Our 2022 guidance assumes over $5 billion of acquisitions and over $40 million of year one G&A synergies we have identified as a result of economies of scale from the merger. These guidance ranges also assume that the anticipated spin-off of our office properties is consummated as anticipated on November 12th. With the closing of the merger, our combined Company eclipses $50 billion in enterprise value with size and scale to support new risk growth verticals. Providing flexibility to close large transactions without creating concentration risk.  Additionally, through this merger, Realty Income has inherited a pipeline platform and talented acquisition team focused on sourcing higher-yielding products that will be additive to our existing pipeline. Further, over time, we expect to generate meaningful earnings accretion by refinancing very outstanding debt supported by our comparatively lower borrowing costs driven by our A3 A minus ratings and capacity to issue debt in lower yielding markets. Finally, we are excited to integrate the capabilities of many talented VEREIT colleagues into the Realty Income business, as we continue to execute our growth initiatives as one team. Now turning to the results of the quarter. We continue to add attractive real estate to our portfolio at a rapid pace. During the third quarter, we sourced nearly $24 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. Of the $1.6 billion of real estate we added to the portfolio in Q3, the largest industry represented was UK grocery stores. On a revenue basis, approximately 38% of the acquisitions made during the quarter were leased to investment-grade rated clients. And our total investment grade client exposure remains approximately 50%. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 13.4 years. And in aggregate, all of our acquisition activities during the quarter resulted in healthy investment spreads, up approximately 164 basis points.  As of quarter-end, our portfolio remains well diversified, including over 7,000 assets leased to approximately 650 clients who operate in 60 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Spain. Giving pro forma effect to the closing of the merger, and the anticipated spin off our combined office assets as of September 30th, 2021. our portfolio now includes over 10,500 assets located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Spain.  Our international pipeline continues to add meaningful value to our portfolio, and we believe it will remain an important driver of growth going forward. In total of the nearly $24 billion in acquisition opportunities that we sourced this quarter, approximately 34% was associated with international opportunities. In the third quarter, we added approximately $532 million of high-quality real estate in the UK and Spain across 31 properties, bringing our total international portfolio to over $3.2 billion.  This quarter, our international acquisition accounted for approximately 33% of total acquisition volume. As previously announced in September, we made our debut acquisitions in Continental Europe through a sale-leaseback transaction with Carrefour in Spain. Subsequent to quarter-end, we announced the completion of an additional Carrefour transaction in Spain, bringing the value of our Continental Europe portfolio to approximately EUR160 million. We are optimistic about our momentum in Spain as we look to replicate the success of our international growth platform throughout the continent with best-in-class operators who are leaders in their respective industries. The health of our core portfolio remains of utmost importance as we continue to expand our platform. At the end of the third quarter, occupancy was 98.8% based on property count, which represents an increase of 30 basis points as compared to last quarter. During the quarter, we released 50 units, recapturing 107.2% of expiring rent, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.5%.  We continue to report on quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,800 releases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those released contracts. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie who will further discuss results from the quarter. Christie Kelly : Thank you Sumit. This quarter our business generated AFFO per share of $0.91. Strengthen by our acquisitions pace and the collection of almost 100% of contractual rent in the third quarter. During the quarter, our theater clients paid approximately 99.6% of contractual rent, representing a meaningful improvement compared to the 38% collection rate in the second quarter.  We continue to be encouraged by the strong box office performance of recent blockbuster releases which we believe signals the long-term viability of the theater industry. I was looking forward to the release of the James Bond film \"No Time to Die\" for months. And based on recent box office numbers, there were many across the globe. We currently have 34 of our 79 theatre assets on cash accountants, with approximately $37 million of non-straight-line reserves on our Balance Sheet. Like our business strategy, our approach to evaluate when these 34 theater assets move back to an accrual basis and the appropriate time to reverse the allowance for bad debt reserves will be conservative and data-driven. More specifically, we will assess the likelihood of collecting on this amount by evaluating store level, and industry-wide data in conjunction with continuing payments of past due rent over a healthy period of time.  As we continue to expand our platform, we will remain steadfast and prioritizing low leverage and a conservative balance sheet strategy while financing our growth initiatives with attractively priced capital. At the quarter-end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5 times, or 4.9 times in a proforma basis adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the third quarter in a row, coming in at 6.1 times. And during the quarter, we raised over $1.6 billion of equities, approximately $594 million, which was through an overnight offering that closed in July, and the remainder primarily through our ATM program. During the quarter, we also issued our debut green bond offering at $750 million multi-tranche sterling denominated unsecured bond offerings, which priced at a blended yield of approximately 1.48% for an 8.8-year blended tenant. We look forward to continuing to partner with our clients around sustainable practices in accordance with our Green Financing Framework. Operator : And now I'd like to hand our call back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christie. In summary, we are energized and pleased by the momentum we see across all areas of our business. We're proud to have close the merger with varied and we expect the benefits of this transaction to be broad and lasting. Enhancing our competitive advantages and generating shareholder value for years to come.  Going forward, the possibilities of our business will be constrained by only our imagination, we look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic growth initiatives, to strengthen our position as the global consolidator of the highly-fragmented [Indiscernible] space while providing our shareholders with compelling risk-adjusted returns over the long run. And at this time, I would like to open it up for any questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Again please limit yourself to two questions please re-enter the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Your line is unmuted. Nate Crossett : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the merge. Julie Hasselwander : Thanks, Nate. Nate Crossett : Yes. I appreciate the color on the pipeline. I would just maybe you could give a little bit more detail, just heading into the end of the year and into next year. What is the mix look like in terms of industrial versus retail U.S versus Europe? Was there a lot of overlap in the [Indiscernible] pipeline between VEREIT [Indiscernible] or the merge? Then I'll ask my second question at same time. Just if you can comment on pricing dynamics U.S. versus Europe. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Nate. Good questions, and yes, we're so happy to have the merger behind us. In terms of the composition of the pipeline ahead, as well as what we've achieved. What we have -- we shared with the market that they should expect the international acquisition to represent about 1/3 of our acquisition volume going forward. In terms of pricing, given surprisingly, when I looked at the spreads that we're generating, either here in the U.S. and comparing it to what we were able to do in Europe. They are very similar for this quarter. And in some quarters, we've seen that we were able to get slightly higher yields in the international markets and in other quarters, it has been the opposite.  So, there's really -- the way we are thinking about our portfolio is through the macro lens that we've identified what it is that is of interest to us. And the area that we, play in Europe is slightly narrower and it's a function of the product that's available than what we play in the U.S. In terms of retail versus industrial, as much as we would like to do more industrial, the pricing in this market keeps us a fairly constrained to that 10%. On a good quarter we are able to get to that 15%, 17% ZIP code.  But that's the composition of the industrial makeup of the overall acquisition. The rest of it is primarily retail. In terms of investment grade versus non-investment grade, we've said this in the past and I'll repeat it again. When we look at credit and we do our own analysis, we don't go out saying if it's a non-investment grade credit, we immediately disqualify it for consideration purposes.  If you look at what we were able to achieve in the third quarter, only 38% of what we did was investment-grade. So, we're very comfortable looking at non-investment grade. A non-investment grade does not necessarily mean sub-investment grade. It just means that it doesn't have a rating from one of the two major rating agencies and it might actually have a sub-investment grade rating, but we're very comfortable with that.  The last question that you had as a subpar to your first question was, in terms of there being an overlap with what we are inheriting from VEREIT, and there really isn't much, there are certainly certain, acquisition opportunities that we would find [Indiscernible] as a competitor. But they play in an area that we believe can truly be additive to our overall platform. And the high-rel side.  And we're still blast to inherit this, this team. And we're really looking forward to being able to completely integrate them into our acquisitions team and have them continue to pursue the transactions that they will pursuing and potentially not be constrained by the cost of capital. So, we genuinely believe that this is going to be an incremental to the acquisitions that we were able to achieve on a standalone basis. And then with respect to pricing, I think I address that through my spread comments so, Nate, I don't know if there's anything specific you want me to dive into. Nate Crossett : No, that's all very helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue. Sumit Roy : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is unmuted. Greg Mc Ginniss : Thanks, Sumit. Hi, Christie. Thinking about the merger with VEREIT, where they have fewer true triple-net leases on average than you guys do. What percent of leases after the acquisition and spend are truly triple-net or will truly be triple-net. And will we be looking to offload some of those non-triple-net leases, and then in general, how should we be thinking about the level of dispositions versus the 5 $billion or more of acquisitions in 2022? Sumit Roy : Good questions, Greg. Look, I think the only area where I felt like we probably had non-triple net leases was on the GSA side of the equation on the office sub-portfolio that they had exposure to. Otherwise largely Greg, they -- these are triple-net leases. And if you think about how this particular portfolio was put together, we'll be able to give you a lot more color once we've got it all integrated, but I'd be very surprised to find gross leases -- preponderance of gross leases on the retail side and the industrial side of the equation.  Obviously industrial products, the landlord tends to be responsible for things like roof and structure, which one could argue is not a pure triple-net lease, but that is largely the same case with respect to our portfolio as well.  But the property maintenance is still the responsibility of the client, the end of the property taxes, the insurances -- insurance on those buildings are still the responsibility of the clients, so we still view those as predominantly net leases. So, with the separation of the office assets through the spend and the GSA leases, I think we are going to be largely a net-lease portfolio, very similar to the one that we have. So, I don't think that that's going to pose any major issues, Greg. Greg Mc Ginniss : Okay. Yes, I was just looking at their various disclosure, has a net around 30% on the retail side, 40 something percent on the industrial side, it's double net, but I get your point on the level of obligation that's really entailing. And then in terms of the level of disposition we should be thinking about whether there's any cleanup there, or just in general versus the $5 billion of acquisitions? Sumit Roy : Yeah. We've been doing about a $100 million to a $150 million. The audio we've gone past $200 million in dispositions on a standalone basis. We would like to inherit and really do a similar analysis on the portfolio that we are inheriting with VEREIT to see if that needs to be altered. A lot of the capital recycling that they were doing pre -merger was on the office side of the equation.  And so, I don't know if the number will dramatically increase beyond a linear extrapolation of going -- adding another $10 billion, $14 billion of assets. So maybe the 150 becomes 250, 275. But give us a quarter to digest this and filter it through our own asset management lens and we'd be able to come back to you with a lot more precise indication. But we don't suspect that it's going to be dramatically different from the run rate that we were doing on a standalone basis. Greg Mc Ginniss : Okay. And then just one quick point of clarification on the $24 billion [Indiscernible] opportunities, you said 34% was international, is that all of Europe or is that just UK and Spain for now? Sumit Roy : Primarily UK and Spain, but we are certainly looking at other geographies that we have identified as core to our expansion objectives but it is primarily in the UK and Spain. Greg Mc Ginniss : So, we could see that source number go up as you start looking more intent. Sumit Roy : As we start expanding, yes, you should expect that to go up. Greg Mc Ginniss : Okay. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brad Heffern : Thanks, everyone. Hey, how are you? On the acquisition guide for 2022, you've talked about how the VEREIT team, the additive but then the guide is the same, the same over $5 billion for 2022. So, is that just beginning of the year conservativism because there's limited visibility in the pipeline or how should we think about that? Sumit Roy : Look, what did we start this year with? It was right around $3.25 billion. Then we went up to $4.5 and now we're about $5. And we want to come out with numbers that we are -- we have a very high level of certainty associated with it. And as we start to develop our pipeline and visibility, we expect that number to go up. But we don't want to come out with a number that we feel like it's overly aggressive coming out of the gate.  So, this has been something that has been very important to us to be able to deliver to the market what we say we will deliver. And as such, you should consider this to be our initial guidance. And the hope is we can do better than that. And with time and as soon as we are in the next year, we hope to be able to get more precise around what the acquisition guidance will ultimately turn out to be. Brad Heffern : Okay. Next one. Maybe for you, Christie. Also, on the '22 guidance, is there anything in there that would be considered kind of one-time in nature, like maybe a reserve release from the theaters or anything like that. We need to consider? Christie Kelly : Hi, Brad. There is nothing of a onetime nature, including reversal at the theater returns. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thank you. Christie Kelly : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Haendel St. Juste: Hello out there. Sumit Roy : Hi Haendel. Christie Kelly : Hi Haendel. Haendel St. Juste: So, I was intrigued by your comments, you mentioned inheriting a team that experienced acquiring high-yielding assets, that'll be added to your platform, and then you also mentioned being very comfortable acquiring hiring yield. I was going to ask you this quarter's 38% investment grade volume was an anomaly, but it doesn't sound like it is. So maybe, can you talk us through your thoughts on portfolio strategy with regards to high-grade going forward and if you are signaling, perhaps a slight shift in your overall thinking of portfolio strategy. Sumit Roy : I'm here to alleviate any confusion Haendel. There are a lot of -- if you look at our top 10 clients and we have Carrefour that shows up there. And Carrefour is a non-rated Company. Yet if you were to look at its Balance Sheet and you were to look at its credit metrics, it would imply a very strong investment grade credit but that does not show up in the 38% investment-grade.  So, we've been playing in the area that we've identified coming out of the strategy sessions that we alluded to in the past. And we feel -- sorry, that's actually Sainsbury it's not Carrefour. Carrefour is actually rated triple B. So, when we come out and we share with you the actual investment-grade numbers, it is truly an investment grade rate rating by either S&P or Moody's. But we play across the spectrum. But we are so focused in the area that we've identified as our area of growth that -- are we as focused in some of the higher-yielding product that our inherited team from VEREIT was focused on. Potentially not. Are we going to do everything that VEREIT was acquiring as a standalone Company? Probably not. But we are trying to create a team and we truly believe that team to be complementary to ours and now it's one team that is going to be able to play across the credit spectrum and be able to truly be an incremental source of acquisitions for us going forward. S o there'll be quarters where we do more than 38%, in fact, we've done up to 50%, 60% of investment-grade, and then there'll be other quarters where we don't. I don't want you to put too much rating to this headline number of how much investment-grade are we actually pursuing, because as I've said to you, that that's a by-product of our strategy, not what drives our strategy. Haendel St. Juste: Great, appreciate the thoughts and clearing that up. Christie, not to beat a dead horse, we've talked about it over the last quarter too, it's been asked on the call today and I guess I'm really still a little reflector still surprised that there hasn't been a recognition of revenues of the movie theatre site. You pointed out a number of the positive industry dynamics that the industry is experiencing here. So is it just more [Indiscernible] And it sounds like certainly right now there isn't any of that in your 20-22 guide. So just trying to square your comments with the I guess the lack of recognition or any sense of timing on that. Christie Kelly : It really, in a nutshell, is timing. We did in the third quarter experience payoffs according to our deferred arrangements, the handful of theater properties and they're back on accrual counting. And we'll continue to evaluate on an asset-by-asset basis and we still have remnants of COVID out there.  We want to make sure that we're evaluating this, not only on an asset-by-asset basis, but also just in terms of what's happening in an [Indiscernible] macro perspective. So, more time. And we'll be back to report to you. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Christie Kelly : You bet, Haendel. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi everyone, congrats on the merger and all the recent progress. Maybe digging a little deeper on the pipeline, I'm wondering if you can talk about the difference in what you're interested in abroad versus the U.S. I think you mentioned that the abroad pipeline might be a little bit narrower? Sumit Roy : Yeah, Caitlin, it's just not as developed -- and partly it's driven by being land constrained. You don't have as many freestanding triple-net opportunities in terms of various industries and various tenants being in that space. Obviously, the size of the actual market is 2x what we have here in the U.S. But the number of industries that mend itself to sort of this triple-net concept are a bit narrower. We've already talked about grocery as being one of the areas that we'd like to focus in on. Hold improvement is another area.  But it is very unusual to find some of the other industries that we're exposed to on the retail side, being available in mainland Europe. And that's really the point I'm trying to make, this is not the constraining factor because I think we put out some numbers, etc. sharing with you how much bigger the actual market is, the addressable market is in Europe that lends itself to net leasable investing. But it really is more of an -- it's just a narrower group of industries that play in that space. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then given your larger size now, do you expect there to be any change in sourcing over the next year? And as a result of that, do you think there will be any meaningful change in your acquisition cap rates? Sumit Roy : I hope so. I absolutely believe that with the newly expanded team that includes folks from what was VEREIT, we will be able to increase our run rate on the acquisition front, and we will be able to cover the credit spectrum a lot more precisely and acutely than we were able to do on a standalone basis, and that should result in not only higher sourcing, but getting more transactions over the finish line.  And that is absolutely one of the levers that we hope will play out for us. And based on everything that we've seen and based on getting to know our new colleagues better, I absolutely believe that is going to play out next year and beyond. So, but time will tell. But that is our expectation. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Great. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, congrats on the VEREIT merger. Just 2 quick ones from me. The first is just going back to acquisition, and I think you've talked about what of a new $50 billion plus enterprise value less concentration risk. There are just more opportunities that present themselves. So, I guess the question is really, is the team doing anything organizationally different to try to source those deals or is the point that historically when those yields have come up, you've had the path on them, but now you could take a look at it. Thanks. Sumit Roy : It wasn't that we were passing on deals, Ronald, it was more along the lines of -- if you look at some of our industry concentration, they were starting to creep to double-digit ZIP codes and somewhat beyond that. And the complementary nature of what we are inheriting from VEREIT, I believe, helps us on a couple of industries. If you look at a few of our largest industries like convenience stores and groceries, etc. All of those concentrations on a pro forma basis, it's actually going to come down. And so, it gives us more capacity to aggressively pursue opportunities that we are finding incredibly compelling to try to get over the finish line. So, it just gives us more capacity, that's one.  The second is, being a much larger Company, and this is a more recent phenomenon, I think 2 years ago, maybe a little bit longer than that, was the first time I heard of a billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunity in our space, and it was on the retail side of the equation. And we've never heard of opportunities of that size. And even for us, if we had some prior exposure to the client doing a billion-dollar transaction, what's going to start to push the concentration risk issue, and now being 1.3 times, 1.4 times the size that we were -- it is less of an issue.  And the size of sale-leaseback opportunities that are now in play are billion-dollars opportunities. Now, we haven't really seen -- there have been announcements, but we haven't seen anything get over the finish line on that front. But that to us is exactly the type of transactions that we would like to be able to show up for and be able to do and be a single-point solution for some of our clients that we perhaps would not have been able to pursue in our previous version. And so, I think that really is what we feel will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. And also, proactively to go to some of these larger companies and be able to say -- and then for large companies by definition, doing a $500 million sale-leaseback doesn't really move the needle for them much. And so, to be able to be a solution and provide multi-billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities for them, I think could be a lot more compelling.  And so those are the types of things that we'd be able to pursue post this closing that we obviously thought a lot about in the past and we have approached certain clients, but it was -- we were guided by what we were hearing in terms of what is really relevant for some of these folks. I think, time will tell, but it certainly creates the platform for us to now be able to pursue some of these transactions which we were not able to as aggressively pursue in the past. Ronald? Ronald Kamdem : Yes. Sorry about that. Great. My second question was just going to 2022 guidance. Obviously appreciate the transparency and I can appreciate these are preliminary numbers. But when I think about the AFFO guidance range, can you maybe share what that assumes in terms of same-store rent growth than the assumptions for reserves for credit losses. Sumit Roy : We obviously gave you a couple of numbers when we came out with this. The point of coming out with a guidance at this point in the cycle, which is non-traditional for us, was largely driven by this acquisition that we did of VEREIT, and there was a lot of uncertainty around what does proforma Realty Income really look like post separation of the office assets.  And this was our attempt to sort of address that going forward. And so, in terms of the other ascension's like same-store rent and other inputs that go into the model, it is largely along the lines of what we've done in the past. And so, you should -- and, of course, as we learn more about the portfolio that we've acquired and we look out into the future and we, more importantly, digest the 6 -- the $5 billion acquisition guidance that we have for this year, I think we'd be in a much better position to give you much more precise numbers on same-store growth etc. But for right now, you should assume it to be the 1% that we usually point to. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS. Your line is now open. Christie Kelly : Hi, Brent. Brent Dilts : Hi, Christie. I've just got a qualitative one at this point, but with the acquisitions in Spain during the quarter, could you talk about what you learned from the transactions and just how does that impact your approach in Continental Europe going forward. And I think in recent calls, you guys have spoken about trying to learn the local market and there's a lot of nuance to it. So maybe you could just provide a little color around your experience there. Sumit Roy : Sorry. Are you asking us what is our filter of going into new markets? Is that the question Brent? Brent Dilts : No, sorry, Sumit, it's more just what did you learn specifically from the process itself as far as like nuance to the deal structures or the negotiations, or just anything about the market that maybe you picked up. Sumit Roy : Brent, I'll tell you very honestly, we did a lot of homework before we actually went into any particular market. We looked at transactions that have taken place in the past, we tried to understand the nuances of the structures, we considered the tax implications, a lot of the homework was done prior to us actually engaging with potential clients or the advisory community to start to pursue transaction.  So, I would say that we weren't overly surprised by the structure of the deals that we've been able to get over the finish line. The one thing that has surprised me personally, and I don't know if Neil and Mark are going to share in my comment, but it's the volume comment, I do believe that we have been able to create these relationships that have cemented to, and have translated into subsequent transactions much more quickly than what we had originally thought.  This is very much a relationship-driven market, which we anticipated but not to the extent that we've seen it play out. They are looking for long-term partners. They're looking for partners that are not in the market to flip out assets and that is right down the fairway for who we are and how we believe in generating value for our investors long-term.  The certainty of close to some is incredibly important, far more so than perhaps here in the U.S., it's not that certainty of close is not important, but they are much more price sensitive here in the U.S., than perhaps in continental Europe, as well as in the UK. So, reputation, size, scale. The fact that we do what we say does seem to be weighed a lot more significantly in all of Europe than what we had anticipated. So that's where the surprise came in, not in terms of the duration of the lease or the cap rates or the growth that we find embedded in these leases. A lot of that was known to us before we went into these markets. Brent Dilts : Okay, great. That's it from me, guys. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Q - John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is now open. John Massocca : Good afternoon. Christie Kelly : Hi. John. John Massocca : Just looking at a leasing spread renewal and releasing [Indiscernible] assets, the third quarter where you're in well above, I guess what -- even recent historical level. Do you think that above 100% recovery is sustainable here or is that maybe more reflection of where we are in the macroeconomic cycle, given the pandemic? Sumit Roy : John, that's a good question. And if you're asking me, can we do positive 7% with next to no capital investments every quarter going forward? I think the answer is probably no. But I do think that over the last 8, 12 and even during the pandemic, the kind of releasing that we've been able to achieve without a bunch of capital investments is a testament to the quality of the portfolio that we have.  But much more importantly, it's a testament to the asset management team under the tutelage of Janine (ph.) that we are able to generate these numbers. And so, I feel like if you look at the trend and you look at what we've been able to do over the last 3, 4 years, we have generally achieved north of 100% releasing spreads.  And this by the way includes not just clients who are renewing an option, but also new clients that we are bringing in, into either empty buildings or buildings that are about to go empty. So, this is the complete picture of what we've been able to achieve. And that is one of the points that we've been trying to talk about that our business, on a normalized basis, is going to become a seven-year world business.  And a lot of value is either going to get created through this channel or not. And we've been anticipating this and building out our asset management team in anticipation of being able to generate the kind of results that we are posting on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So, we feel very good that we -- and we usually target above 100% every quarter and we've been able to do far better than that. And I'll leave it at that. John Massocca : Okay. And then switching gears a little bit back to international, I think can we be pre -pandemic if you look that kind of [Indiscernible] for the UK acquisitions versus the U.S., right UK was always fairly significantly lower than U.S. acquisitions in that spread has kind of disappeared. Also, on top of each other in terms of day one cap rate.  So, is that a factor you think of macro, economic pushes and pulls interest rates, et cetera, or is that a more reflective of different kind of investments that you are targeting either internationally or here domestically? Sumit Roy : It is certainly the latter. And if you're looking at grocery businesses here in the U.S., there's been a tremendous amount of compression that we've seen on the cap rate side of the equation. And I would say that the U.S. market has moved more towards the UK market than the other way around.  But there are differences to the lease structures, etc., and once again, I'm not going to go into the details, but what you see as that headline cap rate, you're seeing that they seem to be very close. There is some inter-quarter variability like I believe in the second quarter we had a slightly higher cap rate associated with international, and it was a function of the type of assets that we got, and the length of the lease terms that we were able to achieve or translated to higher cap rates.  But by and large, the spread which considers both the cap rate as well as the cost of capital, is very similar right now, very, very similar in both these markets. But I do think it's partly driven by -- we are playing in a much narrower industry spectrum in Europe. And we have been doing a lot more industrial here in the U.S. And it sorts of balances out and it yields a number that you see as the headline number posted on our supplemental. John Massocca : That was very helpful. Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is now open. Wes Golladay : Hi everyone. Quick question on the acquisition volume this year. Hi, Christie. When you look at what's driving the upside, is it more on the sale leaseback side or is the developer takeout\u2019s broker deals, just trying to get a handle on where the [Indiscernible] is coming from. Sumit Roy : It's a combination of all forms of development. We are doing takeout\u2019s, we are doing -- we're actually financing 100% of developments. The one common thread is that in the vast majority of the cases, there's a lease in hand. You might see that there's a retail asset wealth, I think on the retail side, it was 93% occupied.  And that's largely driven by repositioning that we're doing. And we don't quite have the lease in hand for that one particular unit. But otherwise, it's all built-to-suit. But we play across the spectrum, providing all of the development funding, as well as doing takeout. Wes Golladay : Okay and then when we look to next year's guidance, you do have about $750 million of high coupon debt in 2023 that is due, is it safe to assume that's not in the number or prepayment of that? Sumit Roy : I'll let Christie answer that. Christie Kelly : [Indiscernible] Wes Golladay : Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Christie Kelly : Thanks Wes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell with Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Katie. I want to come back on the pipeline. Just come back on the $5 billion for next year. And I take your comments are trying to be conservative, it's early, you want to sort of see what the combination of the teams can do. But how did you come up with a $5 billion, you didn't pull it out of thin air, there has to been some rigor to come up with that. So, can you just walk through sort of the analysis and that you went through to come up with that $5 billion. Sumit Roy : Sure. Look, I think as we get more and more comfortable with the strategy that we are currently executing, Michael, it gives us a lot more confidence to be able to say that this is a product that we're seeing. This is the translation rate on that product on the sourcing numbers. We feel very comfortable given the team and infrastructure we have in place that we are going to be able to accomplish the numbers that we've posted.  This year was a very interesting year for us because we had a very healthy pipeline. just like we do today come into the year. But it was post-pandemic and we didn't quite know how things are going to play out. But we felt very good about coming in and saying 3.25 billion, which we have since revised a couple of times.  And so, as we're getting more and more comfortable with the new markets that we're entering into, with the sourcing volumes that we're seeing, with the maturation of the team that we have in place, that's what is giving us the confidence. In the beginning, I assume, talk with my colleagues and we would earmark about 20% to 25% international, well today it's closer to 30%, 35% percent. We've built out the team in the international side.  We have a much more mature team and a fantastic team on the U.S side, and now we're going to inherit a group of veterans from this acquisition. So that's really the buildup that we've done internally and we feel fairly confident about to come out and say, look this year we're going to do north of 5 billion. we should be able to do that with the level of visibility and 1 year behind us now, in 2022. So that's how we came up with that number. Michael Bilerman : Which hearing that would sound extraordinarily conservative, given all the arrows that you have in your quiver to be able to execute additional acquisitions, especially given your other comments about being a bigger Company, allows you to take on different risks, which arguably being a big Company, if you went out and did a billion-dollar portfolio then had $100 million of assets that you didn't want, well, $100 million or $50 billion isn\u2019t that much.  How does that play into your thinking about deal flow from here? And I think you and I talked a little bit about this last quarter or the quarter before, in terms of your willingness to now accept what previously was larger risks that you may be willing to take today in terms of either type of asset, location of asset, credit of tenant, all the variety of things that may have made you pass on deals before? Sumit Roy : I hope what you're saying is exactly right and a year from now we have a number that is far in excess of the $5 billion that we're coming out with Michael. What we don't want to do is have a particular number dictate our decision-making. We want to come out, and this is right along the lines of how we've operated the business. This is the largest acquisition volume number that we're going to be coming out with in our history. You're right, this is by design that we've created all these avenues and we should be increasing our guidance.  And perhaps there is a level of conservatism. But we would like nothing better to come in in February and revise our numbers and say, you know what, we've had a chance to revisit and be able to come in and with a high level of confidence, given all of these new strategies that we are putting a lot more effort into i.e. 1. higher yielding, 2. newer markets, 3. being able to have one quarter, 4. under our belt in Spain, 5. figuring out what we can or can't do there.  All of that hopefully will translate into higher numbers. But this is where we feel that we don't want to over-promise and under-deliver. And that's the reason why we're coming out with what we're coming out with. Michael Bilerman : And then in terms of just from a corporate perspective, I seem time that you're going to talk to large tenants that have a lot of real estate on their books, you are much better equipped today at your size to be able to do those elephant hunting types of transactions.  How active are you in going to those corporations that have the real estate on their books where you can do a direct deal in a much larger scale? And are those further along and -- you have other capital partners as we've seen, there's a lot of institutional capital that would love to get access to the type of portfolios and higher yielding levered plays that you're doing, and so I'm just I'd like to know a little bit more on that front whether we could expect that to be a much bigger part of the story. Sumit Roy : In the past, we have to consider partners when we were coming across these multi-billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities. But I think the need for that has diminished post this acquisition. We had inbounded from investors who wanted to participate on these one-off transactions, larger transactions outside of the realm of the public eye. And we've largely stayed away from that because we felt like the transactions that we were actually seeing in the market that was near-term we could have handled all on our own. We haven't had to pursue a partnership very aggressively.  And I think the need for that has diminished even more so now, with this proforma for the very transaction, and I do believe that our willingness and desire to more actively pursue potential clients that we -- that we've talked about, that we might want to speak with and engage with is a lot higher today, given that the concentration issues that we could have entered into are somewhat muted now. And so, I do think that those types of conversations are going to be a little bit more front and center in terms of what we do. And we are going through it much more proactively. That's correct. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And then the second topic -- last topic is about the office in -- obviously, when you announced the transaction, there was a discussion about not having a plan in place to deal with those assets that you didn't want and be able to contribute the office assets on your Balance Sheet. And you said you were going to pursue two paths, you'd have the spin as you're basically backup option and look at sales process.  Can you talk us through what led you down the path of an office spin and thinking about the dis-synergies from a G&A perspective, how you thought about the value that you would be delivering to your combined shareholder base versus a sale and taking the cash. Why spin versus sale? Sumit Roy : So, you should assume that when we discussed the separation of the office assets, we were very clear with the market that we would have -- that we're going to pursue either a span out or a sale. And we did and where we concluded going through those to parallel path was that the spin is a far better option given where we were coming out on the sales side than not, which is precisely why we decided to choose to go down the spinning of the office assets. Putting a team that was very familiar with all of those assets, had been working very hard on assets managing those assets was, very capable of creating value longer term.  And what we -- the analysis that we went through was to say, okay, they have the thesis. It's a thesis that makes sense. There are some tailwinds in that particular sub sector. Given the success that they've been able to achieve over the last couple of years, you look at that and then you start to see what they can do with this portfolio going forward.  From an alternative perspective, this seems like the absolute right alternative for us to pursue despite the fact that selling the assets would have been an easier step for Realty Income to take. But we did pursue both those efforts in power loan and this is the path that on a risk-adjusted basis yielded the superior outcome for us, and that's the reason why we pursued it. Michael Bilerman : Okay thanks for the time. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Josh Dennerlein : Yeah. Hey guys. Hope everyone's doing well. Now that the VEREIT merger's behind you, you curious, you added a bunch of teammates, any skill set that was brought in that would help you guys widen the aperture? Sumit Roy : Yeah, Josh, that's what we were -- sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead. Josh Dennerlein : No, no, please, please. Sumit Roy : That's what we've been adhering to Josh when we're talking about being able to have a team that is very capable of playing across the credit spectrum for a lack of better phrase, the higher-yielding assets, the lower-yielding assets and being able to cover that entire spectrum with a much broader team. That is one of the biggest advantages that we are inheriting from -- through this acquisition. And there are other advantages of teammates that we are inheriting, not just on the acquisition front, but also on, when you look at some of the data analytics work that we're planning on doing, some of the process re-engineering work that we're doing.  They have a few very talented folks in their team that will become part of some of these opportunities that we are already building out and executing upon and be able to be tremendously additive and help us accelerate some of these opportunities to the finish line and create even more efficiency. So, it's really -- I am so proud of the team that we have inherited and it's [Indiscernible] 100 people that will really help us become a complete team. And of course, helped us absorb north of 3,000 properties, which is not a not a small foot. Josh Dennerlein : Got it. And one other question, I guess relates to dividend strategy going forward. Just kind of curious to hear your thoughts on maybe how about or things about the payout ratio and retained earnings. Sumit Roy : So, our payout ratio is in the high 70s today. We will always be the monthly dividend Company. It took us over 25 years to become part of the Dividend Aristocrat Index, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. This is very core to our strategy going forward. And so, in years where we can grow 9.5% or 9.2% and the midpoint of the range that we've just shared with you, that will just continue to help us grow our dividends in the future.  And that is -- there will be no change to that strategy of annual growth on the dividend going forward. So really no change, Josh, but I just wanted to make sure given that you asked the question that I emphasize how important than core dividend growth is to Realty Income and nothing that we've done either recently or in the past is going to change that. Josh Dennerlein : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Linda Tsai : Hello. With 85% of your leases having some type of contractual rent increased, can you remind us what kind of increases you obtained on the European leases versus domestic, and then across the entire portfolio going forward, what might be average weighted rent increase look like versus what it is now? Sumit Roy : Yeah. Linda, I'm not going to give you precise information. I think it is of strategic importance to us to not be that precise on growth by geography. I will tell you that 85% of our leases have contractual growth.  Either they are in the form of fixed growth, or they are in the form of CPI adjustments, or there are percentage rent clauses into the contract. It's one of those 3 variations that make up the growth profile. You can continue to underwrite to 1% same-store growth for our business going forward, and we will update you as and when warranted, but for right now, that is the assumption you should have for your models. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then how should we think about the pacing mix of capital raising activity in 2022 as you move forward with a plus $5 billion acquisition run rate? Christie Kelly : I think -- go ahead Sumit Sumit Roy : No, no, no, please Christie, go ahead. Christie Kelly : I'll just kick it off to say I think Linda, you can expect that to be consistent with our personal [Indiscernible] this year, in funding our business and continuing to pursue a very competitive cost of capital while maintaining our net debt-to-EBITDA. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Chris Lucas : Good afternoon, everybody, thank you for taking my questions. Really just to -- a lot of the questions have been asked and answered, but I guess just Sumit, given that scale the Company at this point and where your credit rating is. I guess, I'm just curious as to your conversations with the rating agencies post-merger. So, if you've gotten any flexibility or indication from them that you have more flexibility on your leverage side to maintain those very high credit ratings? Sumit Roy : I'll share the headline, but I'll let Christie speak to this point because she actually had the conversation along with Jonathan with the two-credit rate -- rating agencies. They were very supportive. When we in fact went back after our third quarter announcements and spoke with them, they were again, very complementary.  They solve the capital raising that we did and essentially front-loaded the funding of our acquisition pipeline. They continue to reaffirm their current stance of A minus A3 rating and a stable outlook. We feel like we're going to have 2 months of earnings associated with this closing. But all of the Balance Sheet, day 1, so the numbers are going to look a little bit off.  But on a proforma basis for annualized earnings, it's going to be right where we play and where the rating agencies are incredibly comfortable. So, I don't see us being put on any sort of a negative watch or what have you. We've tried to be very transparent, we've shared all the analysis with the rating agencies, and we feel very confident that they will continue to support us and maintain us at the current levels. Christie Chris Lucas : I was just actually going to put it the other way. I'm wondering whether the scale of the Company and the diversification of the portfolio is going to allow you to do more leverage and keep the range that's really where I'm going with this. Sumit Roy : That's a good question, Chris. I don't know the answer to that. And it's very difficult to even enter into a hypothetical with the rating agencies about that particular scenario. It's an -- they tend to be a bit of a black box. And we didn't change our leverage profile that when we were on this way up. And this, I think lends credence to the comments you're making  Chris, but we can't expect that and truth be told, we are very happy with A - /A3 rating, I think. I don't know what the incremental benefit would be getting to an Aa2 rating, but I don't know if it's going to be as significant as going from triple B plus to A minus. But it's a good question and one that I think now that you've asked, we 'll post to the rating agencies to figure out how they're going to think about this. Chris Lucas : And then just a sort of a secondary question, when you think about how you want to finance your business, you mentioned this European rate are more attractive right now than the U.S. for financing. Would you think about financing at a higher level relative to asset base in Europe at this point than you do in the U.S from a debt-finance perspective? And how high would you go? Sumit Roy : Yes, for us Chris, we've been very clear about what the limiting factor has been for us in Europe, we want to use domestic capital to finance as much of our acquisition as possible. But the limiting factor is always going to be the asset value. And so that's one of the biggest advantages that we have is we can raise debt in any geography and in an environment where we see here in the U.S. as the rising 10-year U.S. Treasury not so much today, but expected. We could do a lot more on the unsecured side, assuming we continue to grow in the UK or in mainland Europe, as we grow out there.  But the constraining factor will always be what's on the left side of the Balance Sheet. And does it support, the raising or not. But could it be more levered there than here in the U.S.? Absolutely. That's one of the big advantages of why we did what we did. And on a fully consolidated basis, which is how we think about our business, we're very comfortable implementing that particular strategy. Chris Lucas : Super. That's all I had today. Thank you so much. Sumit Roy : Of course, Chris. Thank you. Christie Kelly : Thanks Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is now open. Christie Kelly : Hi Spenser. Spenser Allaway : Hi. I know you spoke about development earlier; can you just more broadly talk about how the development economics vary between the U.S and Europe? And if possible, can you provide some color around what kind of deals you're expecting on the one UK development you have underway? Sumit Roy : Hi Spenser, we're going to stay away from speaking about specific transactions. We just don't do that. And then I'm going to be asked to remember of 400 properties that we acquired. What is the cap rate on the 388 property? And it's just going to be impossible. That's really the reason why we're staying away from being very precise about specific transactions and we tried to report it to you on a fully consolidated basis.  There is no doubt that we are able to get slightly higher yield on development projects than we would on assets that are ready for delivery. And that could range. It could range anywhere between -- and by the way, that has compressed, but it could range anywhere between 25 basis points to on the odd occasion, maybe 75 basis points, 80 basis points. It used to be north of 100 basis points not too long ago. But for us, we are a yield-driven business.  Every incremental yield is a positive for us Spenser. I do believe that in our supplement, we do provide that level of clarity, we do breakout what the development yields are, and so you should be able to track that as part of our overall acquisition volume, and how much of it is attributable to the development funding. And you will see that it's definitely higher than what we are actually acquiring assets and that's just a testament to our relationships and being able to balance out the overall portfolio. And that's the strategy we continue to play out. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Spenser Spenser Allaway : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you, everyone for coming, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you at Nerige. Goodbye.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2021 Operating [Technical Difficulty]. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager, Investor Relations at Realty Income. You may begin. Julie Hasselwander : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's Fourth Quarter and 2021 Year-End Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements.  We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions].. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. As I reflect on the past year at Realty Income, I remain inspired by the dedication of our colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue numerous profitable growth initiatives while contributing to a record year of acquisitions for our company.  During the fourth quarter, we closed on the merger with VEREIT, welcoming many talented new colleagues that will further help drive our ambitious goals while amplifying our competitive position in the industry. We are committed to a seamless and successful transition as we collectively work to integrate our one team, processes and systems. We remain on track to achieve over 75% of our annualized G&A cost synergies in year one post-merger, as we outlined upon announcing the merger in April of last year. Specifically, we have achieved over $42 million of our $37.5 million targeted synergies in year one, representing full year 2022, with over $50 million in G&A synergies expected in year two, representing full year 2023. Also, I continue to be impressed by the talent and dedication of our new team members as we work to integrate our two platforms and further strengthen our one team. And while we creatively bring together the best practices of VEREIT and Realty Income with our integration efforts to productively scale our operations, I'm encouraged by our integration work completed to date and our journey ahead. Beyond the merger, our business set a quarterly record for investment volume in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we strengthened our foothold in Spain through additional high-quality acquisitions, including our second acquisition of properties leased to a key partner in Carrefour, one of the world's leading grocery retailers.  Our strategic expansion into Continental Europe meaningfully increases our total addressable universe, as we estimate the total addressable market in Europe to be $8 trillion, nearly double that of the U.S. We expect our investment activity in Europe to continue contributing to our competitive cost of capital as we look to further hedge our currency risk with debt priced at meaningfully lower yields than in the U.S.  Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue creating value by capitalizing on our portable competitive advantages globally to deliver favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With regards to recent developments, as previously disclosed this month, we announced our intent to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor, the East Coast's leading integrated resort and casino located less than 5 miles from downtown Boston. The $1.7 billion acquisition is being consummated at a 5.9% cash cap rate with a 30-year initial lease term. The property represents our first investment in the gaming industry and would represent less than 3.5% of our pro forma annual rent. While the property type is new, the lens we use to pursue the merits of the transaction is not. Our investment strategy centers around partnership with best-in-class operators occupying high-quality real estate locations, which is particularly important when entering a new business vertical and geography. We followed this strategy with the Diageo sale leaseback in 2010 when executing our first transaction in the Vineyard space, with the Sainsbury's sale leaseback in 2019 when expanding our business internationally. And more recently, with the Carrefour sale leaseback when we entered into Spain last year.  Our debut transaction in the gaming industry with Wynn Resorts represents the same commitment to partnering with the premier leaders in the respective industries together with a commitment to our overall investment strategy. The Encore Boston Harbor acquisition will add further diversification to our industry and client roster. After closing this transaction, we expect Wynn Resorts will become one of our top 10 clients. Our capacity to pursue and absorb a transaction of this size with a single client was supported by the enhanced size and scale that we gained through the VEREIT merger. And it is a testament to our ability to complete large-scale transactions without significantly impacting our prudent portfolio diversification metrics.  The Encore Boston Harbor transaction meets our key investment criteria and illustrates that our investment opportunity set is not constrained by a particular property type. The merits of this transaction are first, the real estate. We're acquiring 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate strategically located on the banks of the Mystic River. After opening in 2019, the property is still ramping but already generates $210 million in annual EBITDAR, resulting in 2.1x rent coverage initially.  Second, the client lease. We are entering into a 30-year triple net lease with attractive annual rent escalators at 1.75% annually for the first 10 years and the greater of 1.75% or CPI thereafter capped at 2.5%. Wynn Resorts is one of the largest premier gaming operators in the U.S. with an enterprise value of approximately $20 billion. They maintain a healthy balance sheet, moderate leverage and significant liquidity. Third, the industry performance. The gaming industry in the U.S. has recovered to pre-COVID levels. And in Massachusetts, gaming revenues grew 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, outperforming the aggregate regional gaming market that grew 8% during the same time frame. Pending regulatory procedures, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. Craig and his team have been a pleasure to work with, and we are pleased to cultivate this new relationship with Wynn Resorts as we expand our universe of net lease investments across many industries. Now turning to the results for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.5% occupancy based on property count. Bolstered by the inherent quality of our real estate and enhanced by the proactive efforts of our talented and experienced asset management team, we re-leased 232 leases this quarter, recapturing 101.8% of expiring rent and bringing our full year 2021 recapture rate to 103.4%.  Since our public listing in 1994, we have executed over 4,100 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry and is a testament to the merit of our asset management team.  After closing the VEREIT merger, we look forward with an enhanced key competitive advantage of size and scale. With an enterprise value of more than $57 billion, our portfolio now includes over 11,100 properties leased to approximately 1,040 clients in the United States and Europe across a diversified set of 60 distinct industries. Our total portfolio annualized contractual rent increased by over 50% since the end of the third quarter, ending the year at over $2.9 billion. With our expanded size and scale, we have greater client and industry diversification, which further improves our competitive positioning to pursue large portfolio or sale-leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry and be a one-stop solution for multibillion-dollar opportunities. Since the end of the third quarter, our top 10 client concentration has decreased to 29.1% from 34.8%, and we believe it represents one of the highest quality portfolios in the net lease industry. Additionally, our top industry concentration has decreased, creating additional investment capacity. Our top 5 industries now comprise 40% of our annualized contractual rent compared to over 43% at the end of the third quarter and a top industry exposure, which includes convenience stores and grocery stores have declined meaningfully. With the growth in concentration of our targeted industries, theater and health and fitness industry concentrations have naturally declined. In terms of the casual dining contribution from our VEREIT merger, the majority of their concentration is with Red Lobster that has experienced improved operating performance is now owned by Thai Union an established strong financial sponsor.  Our international geographic concentration also declined pursuant to our VEREIT transaction, providing further room to achieve profitable growth in Europe and beyond. We have already started to see the benefits of our expanded platform through increased sourcing and acquisition volume. In 2021, we sourced approximately $84.5 billion of acquisition opportunities and approximately 39% was sourced from international markets. Reflecting our stringent investment criteria, we closed on approximately 8% of the total opportunities, bringing our total 2021 property level acquisitions to $6.4 billion, an annual record for our company. Of the $6.4 billion invested in 2021, over 40% or approximately $2.6 billion was invested during the fourth quarter. Over $1 billion of our volume in the fourth quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to nearly $4.3 billion of invested capital at the end of the year. We believe the market is efficient, and we're experiencing a competitive environment for high-quality assets leased to strong operators. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisition is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the fourth quarter of 5.4% and 5.5% for the year. The largest industries represented in our fourth quarter acquisition were European grocery stores and U.S. automotive services, which represent a continued investment in industries well positioned to perform in a variety of economic cycles, given its necessity-based retail proposition for consumers. The weighted average remaining lease term of assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 14.2 years. We continue to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 140 basis points during the quarter and 150 basis points during the year, consistent with our historical average, while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace.  Inflation has been an important topic to investors in the last few months. I want to emphasize that we believe our business is, by design, well positioned to drive shareholder value in this climate.  From a balance sheet perspective, having a well-staggered fixed-rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024, limits our debt refinancing risk in a potentially rising rate environment. And we believe we actually benefit from an inflationary environment given our lease expiration schedule and our proven ability to recapture more than the value of expiring rent upon re-leasing.  Finally, the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle, which makes the value proposition of owning realty income comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods, as compared to other sectors in the marketplace whose value is high to growth in future years.  At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. During the quarter, our capital markets activity was highlighted by the issuance of over $1.7 billion of equity, primarily through our ATM program, which enabled us to simultaneously complete the VEREIT merger and finance a record quarter for acquisitions while finishing the year within our targeted leverage parameters. As we emphasized when we announced the merger in April, we intended to close the transaction in a leverage-neutral manner relative to our target leverage level, which we are pleased to have accomplished. One of the benefits of our enhanced size and scale is daily trading liquidity in our stock that provides us with the ability to issue significant amounts of equity through the ATM in a cost-efficient manner without disrupting the market price of our stock. As a result, we entered 2022 from a position of strength with a net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3x. Subsequent to year-end, we issued $500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28%, with a weighted average term of 12.5 years.  This was the third sterling-denominated debt offering we have priced in the last 16 months, and we could not be more appreciative of the support we have received from the Sterling fixed income investor base.  Moving on to the financial results for the quarter. In fourth quarter, our business generated $0.94 of AFFO per share, supported by our healthy portfolio, closing of the VEREIT merger, strong acquisition pace and collection of almost 100% of contractual rent during the fourth quarter. Going forward, we will no longer be providing COVID-19 disclosures as we believe portfolio operating performance has returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of overall collection. In 2021, our business generated $3.59 of AFFO per share, finishing near the high end of guidance and representing 5.9% annual growth. Given the health of our portfolio and our active global investment pipeline, we remain comfortable with our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint.  Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In December, we were pleased to have increased our dividend by 5.1% as compared to the same period last year. The increase in the dividend was intended to share with our shareholders, the accretion from the recently closed VEREIT merger, together with continued earnings accretion that we were able to generate throughout the year from our business.  We have now increased the dividend 114x since our 1994 listing and remain proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.  Now I would like to hand the call back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christie. We remain humbled by our collective accomplishments in 2021, including the completion of the merger, but also with the strength of our full year results and our attention now turns to the path forward.  Realty Income has a bright outlook for 2022 and beyond, and we look forward to continuing to build a strong and resilient platform as we embrace the opportunities that lie ahead. As we enter a new year of possibilities, we remain steadfast in our purpose of building enduring relationships and brighter financial futures, while relentlessly pursuing ways to provide shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long run.  At this time, I'd like to open it up for any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Bradley Heffern : Can you talk quickly about how you got comfortable with the risk profile of the Wynn acquisition? Obviously, it's a very large single asset. There are some different regulatory risks involved. So do you see that as being fully compensated for by the higher cap rate and the higher escalators? Sumit Roy : Yes. The short answer, Brad, is yes, we do. For us, our thesis is quite simple. We want to try to partner with the best-in-class operators and get the premier assets that they operate. If you look at the Boston Harbor asset, it is the premier superregional asset in the United States. If you look at the coverage, and this is an asset that is still not fully stabilized, it's at 2.1x. If you think about Wynn, they are an S&P 500 company that is arguably the best operator in the space. If you look at regional gaming and compare it to the volatility associated with the strip, it tends to be a lot less volatile. And more specifically, if you look at the Massachusetts market, which has grown at almost 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Even compared to the national average on the gaming side, it was almost 2x that.  If you look at the actual asset itself and you see what we've paid for the asset and compare it to what was actually invested in the asset, and these are all public numbers, you'll start to get very comfortable with the fact that we feel very comfortable about what we've paid in terms of replacement cost. And we've been very open with the market with respect to our desire to continue to explore new avenues of growth and this is one that completely fits that profile of trying to partner with the best-in-class operators and trying to add best-in-class real estate to our portfolio.  If you look at the lease structure, it's a 30-year lease with growth that is in excess of what we are able to generate on the rest of the portfolio. And those are the reasons why we felt this was the right opportunity for us to sort of enter into the gaming space, with the right operator as a partner and with the right asset. Bradley Heffern : Okay. Thanks for that. And sticking with Wynn, if you did another transaction with them of the same size, obviously, that would likely make them the #1 client. So how do you think about the future of gaming? Is it likely that we'll see another transaction with Wynn? Is it likely that we'll see another one with another operator? Sumit Roy : Look, we did our first transaction in this particular space. So we are very hopeful that we can continue to grow this area. And as long as we feel like we can structure transactions for the right properties with the right operators, we are very happy to grow this area of our business. We've been very open with the market about playing across the risk spectrum with regards to yield, and yield for us is a proxy for the risk associated with it. And if we feel like on a risk-adjusted basis, we're able to grow our portfolio even within gaming, we'll be very happy to do so. We continue to talk about how important partnerships are for us and Wynn is that. It's a long-term partner. And in the event they decide that they would like to pursue other transactions, we would like to be there for them and continue to grow our exposure to gaming and in particular, our exposure to Wynn. Operator : The next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Your line is open. Nathan Crossett : Maybe just following up on those questions a bit. Can you tell us anything about -- was this a competitive bid process? How many bidders? How many rounds? And then I'm assuming there's no other gaming assets in the pipeline right now, but is there a way you could confirm or deny that? Sumit Roy : I'm not going to answer your second question. But the first one, there was no process. This is -- like we said, we emphasize relationship above all else. And we wanted to partner with Wynn. And this came about through a conversation that started towards the end of last year. And so there were no rounds. There were no other folks. It was purely a relationship-driven transaction. Nathan Crossett : Okay. Interesting. Thank you. Maybe just a question on pricing more broadly. Cap rates continue to come down. I think the commentary across the space is that there remains a lot of pressure there, even with funding costs kind of going up. So what are you kind of seeing, I guess, in your pipeline right now? And what's kind of your expectation, I guess, for the numerator side of the equation this year? Sumit Roy : Yes. That's a very interesting question, Nate. We continue to see a very aggressive cap rate market, especially for the type of products that we are pursuing. We would have thought that given the fact that we've been in this -- expectation of higher inflation, higher interest rate environment that would start to sort of percolate into the rest of the acquisitions market, we haven't seen that yet. Now history would suggest that cap rates do tend to adjust, especially if some of these increases become more than just an expectation. But at least the current market situation is one where we are not seeing even a stabilization of the cap rate, we continue to see downward pressure.  And this is where being able to partner and lean on relationships, et cetera, is going to allow us to potentially get that 5, 10, 15 basis points above market. And that is the hope. But I do think that in the next six months to nine months when interest rates do rise, that cap rates will follow suit. This is a phenomenon that we have seen played out in the past, and there is no expectation that it's not going to play out, but we don't see that currently.  In terms of what are we underwriting for the rest of the year? Our hope is that it is slightly above where we ended up last year, but we can't guarantee that. Our pipeline is incredibly robust with, again, opportunities that we love. And like I said, at least in the current market, we are not seeing cap rates move.  The one point I will add, and I think I covered that in my prepared remarks is the fact that we have inherited a team that was very used to focusing on the higher yielding side of the market. And that's part of our business. And that particular team has already started to produce results, above and beyond what we were being able to do pre-merger. And so could we see that help us on being able to achieve slightly higher cap rates? Potentially, but it's still too early to tell. But that is a team that is -- has hit the ground running and is performing as we had expected, and it's great to have them as part of the broader team. Operator : The next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : You're going to hear Encore a bit more here. Hope you don't mind. Just curious how you went about getting expertise on the gaming space that was necessary for underwriting this new vertical? And then who from the team is getting licensed to allow for the acquisition in Massachusetts? Sumit Roy : Greg, like a lot of things. We are so blessed to have a set of colleagues who are capable of understanding a new industry, are capable of underwriting the risk associated with that particular industry. And the fact that a lot of us have come from previous backgrounds that lends itself to a much wider realm of industry focus than what we were doing here at Realty Income also allows us greater confidence. The fact that we partnered with Wynn and to work with Craig and his team, that tool allowed us to continue to refine our thesis around the risks associated with this business. And we are very comfortable that we have underwritten this particular opportunity appropriately. And we have leaned on experts where needed and also obviously leaned a lot on our own research department that continues to be the best-in-class in my opinion, across the street.  And that's how we got very comfortable with this new vertical that we are pursuing and more specifically with the operator that we have partnered with over the long term.  In terms of your second question with regards to who's going to go through the licensing process? Too early to tell. I know Michelle, our General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer, is working very closely with the MCG and is trying to figure the answers to those questions. But I don't have a precise answer on that for you yet. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And then Craig Billings mentioned that in terms of the deal only achievable due to the unique way the Realty being structured, are you able to further elaborate on that comment? And then also, why are you comfortable not requiring the CapEx minimum where the gaming REITs do typically require one? Sumit Roy : Yes. Again, this was very important to Craig and his team. The fact that we were able to create a bespoke lease that works for them and works for us was very important to both partners. And for us, we are not in the habit of going out there and essentially copying leases that our precedents within this space. We approach this as a relationship, and we try to address what their pressure points were. We try to understand what causes those pressure points. And therefore, came up with a very bespoke lease that works for our partner at Wynn and works for us. With respect to minimum capital requirements, et cetera, we feel like the entire brand of Wynn is associated with their investments in their properties. And you don't have to take my words for it. You just -- you can go and actually visit the property and see for yourself what I mean when I say that. And the fact that we don't have that specifically outlined in the lease is one that we were very comfortable with. Plus there are other protections that supported to us through the gaming licenses that you get in the Massachusetts. And so we feel like looking at it holistically, we are very well protected. Partnering with somebody like Wynn who invests in their properties above and beyond what most other operators do plus certain other provisions that we could lean on I think, gave us the comfort and allowed us to partner with them because that was a pressure point for them. So we are very, very comfortable with where we ended up. And we were glad we could do it and structure it so that Craig and his team were very comfortable moving forward. Operator : The next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe moving to a different topic. Sumit, you mentioned earlier that lower-cost European debt helps to support investment activity in Europe. However, taxes do seem to be another piece to consider. So just wondering if you could give an update on how you consider the tax impact on your decision to acquire in the U.S. versus abroad? Sumit Roy : Yes, Caitlin. That is certainly a cost of doing business in Europe and one that we take into account when we are underwriting assets and looking at long-term return profiles of opportunities that we ultimately end up pursuing.  And one of the ways we try to protect ourselves is by essentially match funding with local denominated currency these acquisitions, which is why if you look at it, the international portfolio on a stand-alone basis, you will find that we have raised a lot more debt to finance that business while not compromising obviously, on a fully consolidated basis, the overall leverage profile of our business. And the interest expense associated with that debt is a natural hedge and a natural protection to minimize the effective tax rate that we end up paying. So that's a very important point in our capital strategy of how we want to continue to grow our European business.  Having said that, it is true that the cost of debt in Europe, even in this increasing rate environment, continues to be less than what we can achieve here in the U.S. Today, I would say, if you were to look at a 10-year unsecured, it's probably in the 3.1%, 3.2% ZIP code for us. Whereas we can probably get 2.8%, 2.7-ish percent in the U.K. and 1.9%, potentially even slightly less in Mainland Europe in terms of 10-year unsecured bond. So that's what I meant when I said that our cost of capital is very portable and the advantages that accrue to us due to this cost of capital and our ratings essentially, gets inflated when we are able to take advantage of markets such as Mainland Europe and the U.K. So that's the strategy, and that's what we feel most comfortable with. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then maybe on the tenant side, you guys ended the fourth quarter with occupancy at 98.5% guidance is for about 98% this year. So I realize that's a potential small shift, but we do hear how healthy tenants are these days. So wondering if there's something in particular that you're expecting or if it's more of a general buffer, which then could you just comment on the watch list maybe more broadly? Sumit Roy : Yes. That's a good question, Caitlin. And it's the last statement that you made, which is how we think about occupancy. We say it's roughly around 98%. Keep in mind, we've also just inherited 3,000 assets through the merger that we have digested and we feel very comfortable saying that it's right around 98%.  If you look at where we were last year, you look at the year before that, that tends to be the guidance that we gave to the market. Look, we could flex that number. We could try to have a higher occupancy number, if that was a target for us. But what we are trying to balance Caitlin, and I'm just sharing a little bit about how we think about our business, is trying to optimize the economic outcome on each one of these assets that is coming through to us. And we try to figure out whether it makes sense to sell it and maximize our total return profile, even vacant or invest capital and try to capture the rents and create a profile that is superior to selling it vacant or completely repositioned that asset. And all of those elements are on the table, and we go through and we try to figure out what is the best outcome. And the reason why we say 98% is because there will be a few assets that we want to hold on to and reposition and/or take the time to find the right tenant so that we maximize the total return profile. And that does sort of put downward pressure on our occupancy number. So when we talk about approximately 98%, it's to give us the flexibility to do what we want to do on the asset management side.  And you probably have tracked this, you can see that we have, more often they've not beaten that. So it really is more a mindset rather than a very precise point that we are trying to strike with regards to occupancy is to give us this flexibility that we need to maximize economic outcome. Operator : The next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Spenser Allaway : Given the strength of tenant credit within gaming, you mentioned the coverage levels, the attractive lease terms. As you consider additional gaming deals, does your view on tenant concentration change? Or said differently, how high would you allow any one gaming tenant to go given you could argue it is a superior credit relative to some other traditional retail tenants? Sumit Roy : That's a great question, Spenser. Look, we obviously have certain speed bumps that's part of our investment policy that imposes certain restrictions on tenant concentration as well as industry concentration. Just so you have it, with regards to client concentration, it's 5%. And with regards to industry concentration, it's 15% as per our investment policy. So you have those speed bumps, if you will, to sort of make sure that we continue to be a very diversified portfolio. Having said that, we just executed on a -- well, it's not closed yet, but we've announced a $1.7 billion transaction. And yet, it's going to represent less than 3.5% of our overall client concentration. So we clearly have more room here, both on the industry side as well as on the specific client side to grow this business. We haven't entered into the gaming industry to basically say this is one transaction and we are done. This does become a new avenue of growth.  However, we will continue to remain very selective in terms of how we decide to grow this particular area. But those are the metrics that you can look to sort of to help us through the concentrating, both on the industry side as well as on the client side. But we certainly would like to grow this business. And for the right opportunity, we are more than willing to compromise some of these limits that we have in our investment policy. Of course, it will require Board approval, but we've done that in the past.  If you recall, Walgreens used to be north of 5% at one point. So was 7-Eleven. And post the merger, both of them have dropped below 5% today. But for the right clients and the right opportunity, we are more than happy to make compromises on those limits. Spenser Allaway : Okay. That actually answered all my follow-up questions. And but -- so maybe one more. As you continue to identify new lanes of external growth, just curious if you've explored the possibility of expanding into ground leases similar to what we've seen ABC do? Sumit Roy : Yes, Spenser, I think this is a question that's been asked before. I want to say about 2.5% of our revenues come from ground leases. But let me tell you that when you go into this market today and a particular opportunity is being marketed as a ground lease, i.e., there's a building, but you don't really own the building. If you look at the pricing, the expectation of the seller is that you're paying for both the building as well as the ground because the building is going to come with the ground at the expiration of the lease term. And so yes, it's -- you can claim that this is a ground lease that you are purchasing, but the actual proceeds being paid for those opportunities, are essentially a fee simple opportunities. So we don't talk about the fact that a certain portion of our rent concentration comes from ground leases, primarily because we recognize that more often than not, we are paying for the building as well. And so yes, I'd love to be able to start talking about ground leases that we have, but the cost base is on those ground leases, you recognize to be fee simple transactions. Operator : The next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just a quick question. Following up on sort of the sale-leaseback opportunities. Just want to get a sense of sort of post the merger closing. Just what resources has been allocated in terms of personnel or structure to going after these sort of opportunities and so forth? Sumit Roy : Well, if you track our personnel count, and I think Shannon started posting those, but I don't know. You will see that we have grown our team quite a bit. And some of that has sort of translated into a more normalized G&A number. And if you look at where we ended up in 2021, it's at 371 people. If you compare that to where we were at the end of 2020, it was closer to 230-odd folks. And so the team has grown. Part of it obviously came through the VEREIT merger, but also organically in order to continue to pursue and expand the avenues of growth, we have rightsized the team both on the research side, on the acquisition side, on the asset management side, on the property management side, et cetera, et cetera.  And so I think this is a reflection of a business that is continuing to grow and not only grow in its traditional routes, but also continue to increase new avenues of growth. And so that is going to translate into a broader personnel base as can be seen by these numbers. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my second question is just on your thinking about sort of external growth opportunities. You've talked about sort of looking at higher-yielding structures and so forth. Just curious how much thought goes into potentially looking at higher escalator structures similar to sort of the transaction that went through? Sumit Roy : A lot is the short answer. If you look at our straight-line cap rate for 2021, the headline number was I think 5 4 for the fourth quarter, but there's 80 basis points of straight line. So it's really a 6.2% straight-line cap rate for the fourth quarter. And so you can imagine the only way to generate 80 basis points of straight-line rent on an annual basis is through these higher growth rates embedded in the leases. And so that is a conscious effort on the part of Mark and Neil's teams who continue to generate that inherent growth profile that we have traditionally and make that a much higher number going forward.  And so part of how we think about looking at new opportunities, new verticals, is to see the profile of the existing leases that are percolating in the market within those spaces. And that is certainly an element that we take into consideration before deciding to pursue routes. Operator : The next question is from Katy McConnell with Citigroup. Mary McConnell : Just wanted to follow up on an earlier question on taxes. I'm just wondering what the higher tax expense guidance for the year is factoring in, in terms of your targeted U.S. versus international acquisition mix for this year? Sumit Roy : Christie, do you want to take that? Christie Kelly : Sure. Thanks, Sumit. Thanks, Katy. Yes, the higher taxes are incorporating our international growth, Katy, which is very similar to what we experienced this year as well, as Neil and the team are making some great progress. Mary McConnell : So just in terms of a targeted mix for U.S. versus international, what should we be thinking about this year relative to last? Christie Kelly : I think that international, you could be looking at 35%, 65%, 60-40 U.S. international. Mary McConnell : Great. That's helpful. And then just regarding the acquisition pipeline, are there any other new investment categories that you're still actively exploring outside of gaming that you can speak to or update us on? Where you're finding similarly attractive investment or opportunities today? Sumit Roy : Yes, Katy, I won't go through the areas that we are internally discussing, exploring, underwriting, because that becomes an exercise in futility, right? We talk about certain avenues and they don't materialize, and then it becomes a constant question in every subsequent call as to when we are going to go into it. We'd much rather consummate a transaction, get it over the finish line and then discuss our rationale as to why we chose to go down the path of entering into that new area. But suffice to say, Katy, we are exploring multiple avenues of growth. And some of the discussions that we've had on this call should give you an insight into what is driving our thought process around new avenues that we would like to consider going forward. But I just don't want to engage in a conversation right now, Katy, with respect to going into too much details on what those are because some may never materialize. And so just bear with us, and I want to be very clear, there are new areas that we are constantly looking at. And if and when we are able to get something over the finish line, we will absolutely talk to you, and you can grill us on the details as to the why we chose to pursue those routes. Operator : The next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : A question on what percent of your ABR is on cash accounting basis? And then could you provide some color on the rent repay that you got in 4Q on the previously uncollected amounts? Sumit Roy : Christie, you want to take that? Christie Kelly : Sure. Yes, of course. So essentially, when we're taking a look at the overall deferred rents and impact of -- essentially, collections have been exceedingly strong. The total deferral amount is about $140 million, $150 million as of 12/31/21 at the end of the year. And we're achieving a very strong collections in that regard. As we also noted in the fourth quarter all of our theater clients are current. And so great progress.  And then in terms of what you would have seen in the fourth quarter, because of those strong theater collections, we actually recorded total bad debt expense of less than $1 million and less than $15 million for the entire year because of the fact that we had those strong collections. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. And sorry, did I miss what percent of your ABR is on cash accounting basis or... Christie Kelly : We have overall cash accounting basis on ABR, modest I want to say. Yes, it's less than 2%. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. Perfect. And then sorry if I missed this in the opening remarks, but the Encore acquisition, it came with an expansion opportunity. Could you maybe walk us through this opportunity and the additional economics it would offer? Sumit Roy : Sure, Joshua. So there is a parking lot that is across the street from where the main building is located. Today, if you talk to Craig and his team, they're actually having to pass on some of the patrons given the lack of parking space that is required to accommodate this increase in traffic. So the goal is for them to develop a multistoried aboveground, potentially even below ground parking that is going to not just be a parking lot, but also it's going to have an entertainment venue of up to 1,000 seats, maybe it's 999 seats. Plus a few other entertainment areas right in that -- in the same building that is going to get constructed across the street. And it's going to have an enclosed tunnel, aboveground tunnel pathway that leads right into the casino into the Encore Boston Harbor building from this building. And so the expectation is that this is going to get built over the next couple of years and will actually add to the overall performance of the building.  And clearly, this is a very symbiotic relationship between this parking lot, this enclosed pathway that's going to connect the 2 buildings. And so we -- they have the ability -- once constructed, and there's a 6-year time frame within which they have to do this, which gives them plenty of time to be able to consummate their current plans. We will buy this building at a 7% yield. And obviously, this should translate into even better coverages than we currently have at the particular building. But that is the option that you're referencing that's there in the lease. Josh, did that answer your question? Josh, I think, you're muted. Operator : His line is now closed. And the next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. John Massocca : First, just a quick kind of detailed question. Was the Wynn transaction kind of contemplated in your prior guidance? I just think, obviously, the per share results won't be heavily impacted given the expected timing, but it was just notable that there wasn't really a change in acquisition outlook. Sumit Roy : John, I think you've been covering us for many, many years, and you probably have a very good understanding of when we talk about acquisitions, when we talk about guidance, it really does not have the underlying opportunities perfectly laid out because we don't have that visibility. There's a confidence level, there's a feel for the market. There's a feel for the opportunities that we are seeing. And that is the reason why based on the earnings guidance that came out, the underlying acquisitions guidance was above $5 billion. We don't know what the makeup or the composition of $5 billion worth of transactions are going to look like, some of which could be assets like the gaming asset that we just announced. But that's a very big asset.  So we feel now even more confident that above $5 billion is very much an achievable number, assuming that we are able to close on this transaction by the fourth quarter. But it is very difficult to say, oh, you should completely exclude this number from the $5 billion or it was inclusive of the entire $1.7 billion, just given the sheer size of this. But what it does allow us to do is stand in front of you today and say with a high level of confidence -- a higher level of confidence that achieving a north of $5 billion number for this year is, in fact, something that we feel very good about. So that's how I would answer that question. John Massocca : Okay. Understood. And then maybe thinking bigger picture, you've obviously been in the net lease space for a long period of time. As you look back to other periods of times where you've been in a rising interest rate environment, and you compare it to the kind of current environment we're in, what do you think are kind of the factors, if you will, that will drive cap rates to be more reflective of kind of rising rates?  And I guess maybe as you look at kind of the competitive set that you compete with for these net lease investments, how kind of interest rate sensitive maybe are they today versus kind of the competitive set in other periods of time kind of similar to the one we're in today? Sumit Roy : Yes. That's a very good question, John. I can tell you that based on our own internal analysis, we have obviously seen the cycle before. Rising interest rate environments, what happens to cap rates then. And what we found is that there is a positive correlation between rising interest rate environments and cap rates, but there tends to be a bit of a lag now. Is it 6 months, 9 months, 12 months? It's somewhere in that ZIP code, but there is. And if you think about it fundamentally, obviously, if cap rates are rising, especially in the private markets that leans on the debt environment a lot more, the cost of that debt is going up.  And so at some point, there's a mismatch between existing cap rates and the cost of financing that particular opportunity. And so those do tend to sort of balance out and reach an equilibrium point. That's what we've seen in years past.  There is one difference in today's environment, and that is that net lease as a product has become much, much more institutional. And we have seen a plethora of capital coming into our space on the private equity side, on the sovereign wealth side and, of course, with the preponderance of public net lease companies that have recently come into the floor.  So I think that wall of capital that is now interested in net lease is going to potentially put a curve on how quickly we get to this equilibrium point going forward. And I think in this sort of environment, once again, the fact that we are an A-, A3-rated company. And yes, our cost of debt will certainly go up and has gone up. But it will tend to go up less than a lot of our competitors who are perhaps not as rated as highly. And also in the private markets, the folks that lean on leverage a lot more and therefore, there -- the impact to their cost of capital will be much higher than the impact to ours, I think is an advantage that should allow us to continue to do transactions that others might have to step away from. So even though I believe in today's environment, that the equilibrium point might take a little bit longer to achieve. I believe that some of the advantages that Realty Income as a platform is able to sort of embrace. I do think that, that will play out more in our favor and will allow us to do things that others might not be able to get to as quickly. Operator : The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : I believe the later 4Q closing of the Wynn transaction is typical for the industry, given regulatory considerations, but what are your general thoughts around buying high-value assets or portfolios that close at a later date to create more visibility in terms of funding and hitting investment targets, do you see advantages to this approach? Sumit Roy : Yes. Linda, that's a very good question. And I think I've received questions around, \"Hey, this is a very large transaction, it's $1.7 billion. How are you going to finance it?\" For us, yes, it's a single transaction, but that the size of that transaction is -- it's not unprecedented. We just did $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. And -- just in that quarter, and we're able to match fund our acquisitions by raising our equity, $1.7 billion of equity in the fourth quarter through the ATM.  And obviously, we did some more debt on the unsecured side post the fourth quarter. So for us, I think, again, one of the big advantages that we have is the liquidity that our stock affords us. We are trading close to $200 million in stock on a daily basis and are able to very easily raise capital to match fund, what might seem nominally as being a very large number, we are able to match fund it without this overhang situation. So we -- if it closes in the third quarter or whether it closes in the fourth quarter, it doesn't really matter to us because we'll have a much better feel for it internally. And we'll be able to match fund accordingly. So yes, it's a big number on a single asset, but I don't think we see this as necessarily causing any overhang or should not cause any overhang issues for us. Linda Tsai : And then in terms of vacated boxes, you talked about weighing the decision between selling and maybe putting some capital back in to maximize value. Could you give us some examples of how you've repositioned boxes in the past and maybe what type might be more amenable to the strategy currently? Sumit Roy : Yes, Linda, that is very much a function of the type of box that we are talking about, a convenience store could be converted into a car wash or could remain a convenience store. A 10,000 square foot box could be turned into a 2 or 3-tenant box that actually generates 150%, 160% of expiring rents. We've had examples of Pizza Hut that have been converted into Starbucks in multiple places. And there are a lot of coffee chains that are aggressively growing their portfolio and are more than willing to pay for repositioning of either previous QSRs or Pizza Hut et cetera given the location, et cetera, and are more than willing to pay us rents that are in excess of what the expiring rents were in their previous life. So those are some of the repositionings that we have accomplished to date and what we hope to be able to do because these can be quite positive from a rent per square foot perspective is to grow that part of our business going forward, and that is the goal. But yes, so far, so good. Operator : The next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Christopher Lucas : Just a quick question on the balance sheet, if I may. And Sumit, thank you for the sort of current pricing on 10-year debt that you see out there. I guess just curious as to what the capacity you think you have today is for additional sterling-denominated and/or euro-denominated bonds given the portfolio at this point? Sumit Roy : Christie, do you want to? Christie Kelly : Yes -- sure, Sumit. Yes, Chris, I think from that perspective, we've got plenty of runway for 2022 in order to be able to execute in alignment with our capital strategy. And further to this, realize it wasn't part of your question, but we're also looking forward to executing on the euro market, too. Christopher Lucas : Okay. I guess the point of the question really gets to -- you've got a number of bonds. They're not near term, but they're sort of intermediate terms that are coming due at above market relative to sort of what you think you could do today. Just curious as to how you think about how aggressive you'll be in terms of looking to essentially refinance that debt? Christie Kelly : Yes. And I think Chris that's -- for example, in 2022, we have a very modest debt maturities. And in terms of what we articulated as it relates to the VEREIT transaction, we're very focused on that here in the coming years, and we will be aggressive in that regard. Sumit Roy : The only other thing I'll add, Chris, is we've done liability management throughout the years. Even last year, we went ahead and we paid the 2023s and the '24s out. So this is something that we will continue to monitor. And if it makes sense, we are more than happy to prepay our unsecured bonds and take advantage of interest rate environments that we find ourselves in. So I just wanted to leave you with that, but that is certainly a tool available to us, and we will avail of it at the appropriate times. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I'll now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Chris. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you soon at the upcoming investor conferences. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to Realty Income\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Operating Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager of Investor Relations at Realty Income, you may begin your conference. Julie Hasselwander : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s first quarter 2022 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Julie. Welcome everyone. 2022 is off to a strong start, and we are continuing to build momentum in our business. I want to express my deep appreciation of our One Team whose dedication and collaboration showcased the strength of our team through a timely closing of the first quarter, while integrating new processes and systems following the close of the VEREIT merger last November. All integration efforts are progressing and we remain committed to delivering continued scalability. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives and partnerships with our clients. In April, we published our second annual sustainability report, which details our commitments, goals and progress on our ESG efforts. I welcome all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to build sustainable relationships for the benefit of those we serve and encourage everyone listening to read through our 2021 sustainability report, which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility page of our website. Looking at macro trends, inflation persists as an important topic on the minds of many stakeholders and I want to emphasize that we believe our business is by design well-positioned to drive value in this climate. Our business model is one that generates significant recurring revenue that flows through to the bottom line. As a triple net lease REIT, our business is insulated from inflation. Our clients are responsible for covering taxes, insurance and other operating expenses. And as prices increase, many of our clients pass the incremental cost burden on to their consumers or suppliers. The efficiency of our model is reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin, which is routinely around 94%. Maintaining a conservative capital structure has been a key tenet of our business since our founding and having a well-staggered fixed rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024 limits on debt refinancing risk in a rising rate environment. In summary, we believe the appeal of our consistent and predictable stream of cash flows is amplified during periods of volatility like we find ourselves in today. To that end, we look at the last period in which the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from December 2015 through 2018 as a helpful case study. During this period, Realty Income\u2019s total return outperformed the S&P 500 and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index both in year 1 of the rate hike cycle and throughout the 3-year duration of that cycle. And during the Great Recession, Realty Income exhibited less operational and financial volatility as compared to many other S&P 500 REITs that carry A credit ratings. From an organic growth standpoint, our asset management team continues to report impressive recapture rates. This quarter, we recaptured over 106% of rental revenue on expiring leases. Given our lease expiration schedule and proven rent recapture track record, we believe we are well-positioned to manage through an inflationary environment. Through 2024, nearly 12% of our portfolio annualized contractual rent is set to expire. And in this regard, inflation could serve as a tailwind to our business as rents and costs to build rise. On the acquisition front, our transaction flow remains strong. Certain categories of the market, has seen discernible increase in cap rates, which we believe should accrue to our advantage as a net acquirer. Historically, we have observed that when interest rates increase, cap rates are just following a lag period of 6 to 12 months. Much of this cap rate expansion can be attributed to levered buyers who have relied upon record low debt pricing to underwrite their returns. Given the current yield environment, we are in a comparatively strong position given our financing strategy. And as such, we would expect our competitive standing to strengthen further. Now, turning to the results for the quarter, our size and scale, in conjunction with strong relationships we have across the marketplace, continue to provide benefits through robust sourcing and acquisition volumes. This quarter, we sourced over $34 billion of acquisition opportunities. And approximately 40% of this amount was sourced from international markets. Our total property level acquisitions for the quarter, was approximately $1.6 billion. Approximately half of our volume in the first quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to approximately $5 billion of invested capital. As we announced in February, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor Resort and Casino leased to Wynn Resorts under a 30-year triple net lease with favorable annual rent increases. The $1.7 billion transaction includes more than 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate less than 5 miles from Downtown Boston. Pending regulatory procedures, we continue to anticipate this transaction closing during the fourth quarter of 2022. We believe the market is efficient. And while cap rates have stabilized, significant competition remains with the high-quality assets we pursue. Our average initial cash cap rate for the quarter was 5.6%, which reflects the quality of locations and clients we are adding to our portfolio. As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. We estimate the difference between cash and straight line cap rates to be approximately an additional 70 basis points in the first quarter. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.3 years and the top industry invested during the quarter was grocery stores. We continue to have access to attractively priced capital, which has allowed us to maintain healthy spreads on our investments even as interest rates rise. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.6% occupancy based on property count. The weighted average remaining lease term of our overall portfolio is approximately 8.9 years, which as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we see as an advantage. As leases roll, we continue to favorably recapture rent as a result of diligent underwriting and the inherent quality of our real estate enhanced by the proactive efforts of our experienced asset management team. This quarter, we re-leased 119 leases, recapturing 106.2% of expiring rent. And since our public listing in 1994, we have executed 4,260 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 101% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates, because we believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. During the quarter, we sold 34 properties, generating net proceeds of approximately $122 million. Approximately, 84% of the sales volume during the quarter related to former VEREIT properties that were sold rated. And our portfolio delivered healthy same-store rent growth increasing 4.1% during the quarter. This was largely attributed to the reversal of $9.4 million of rental revenue reserves during the quarter within the same store pool compared to a reserve of $8 million recognized for the same pool during the year ago period. Excluding the impact of reserves in both periods, we estimate that our same-store rent growth would have been approximately 1.2%. At this time, I will pass it over to Christie who will further discuss results from the quarter. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. During the first quarter, our business generated AFFO per share of $0.98 supported by a strong acquisition pace and a healthy portfolio. As Sumit mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized a $9.4 million reversal of non-straight line rental revenue reserves. This was primarily driven by the $7.7 million reversal of our outstanding reserves related to AMC, reflecting the recovery from the pandemic. Given the performance of our One Team, the health of our portfolio and progress achieved during the first quarter of 2022, we reaffirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint. From a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.4x in line with our target leverage ratios. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal with a well-staggered predominantly fixed rate debt maturity schedule and no corporate bond maturities until 2024. As Sumit mentioned in his opening remarks, our modest debt maturity schedule through the end of next year limits our refinancing risk in a raising rate environment. Our size and scale provide us access to attractively price debt across several markets. For example, in January, we issued \u00a3500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28% with a weighted average term of 12.5 years. During the quarter, we issued over $660 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. And subsequent to the quarter end, we entered into a definitive agreement for the private placement of a \u00a3600 million sterling-denominated offering of senior unsecured notes, pricing 8-year, 10-year and 15-year notes at a weighted average fixed rate of 3.22%, with a weighted average tenor of approximately 10.5 years. We greatly appreciate the support from the investors who have participated in our capital markets transactions. Finally, just last week, we announced the recast and upsizing of our credit facility, which now includes a $4.25 billion multicurrency revolving line of credit with an initial maturity in June 2026 and two 6-month extension options as well as a $1 billion accordion feature. At our current credit rating, the new revolving line of credit provides a borrowing rate of adjusted SOFR plus 72.5 basis points as compared to our previous credit facility of LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points. In total, 25 lenders participated in our recast and we greatly appreciate the support of our relationship banks, many of whom have supported us for decades and have been integral towards our growth. We have been most active during the last 12 months within corporate finance and capital markets. I\u2019d like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and his team who have worked tirelessly to bring our corporate financing strategies and capital markets execution together with our partners to fruition on behalf of all whom we serve. Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In March, we celebrated the payment of our 620th monthly dividend by virtually bringing the New York Stock Exchange closing bell. At Realty Income, the dividend is sacrosanct and we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. And the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle. As a result, the value proposition of owning Realty Income is comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods versus those whose value is tied to growth in future years. And now, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christie. Our business continues to perform and we are well-positioned to build on our momentum throughout 2022 and beyond. These are interesting times and I remain encouraged by our One Team\u2019s creativity and work effort. We remain steadfast in our pursuit of providing our stakeholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. Thank you again to our team and partners for helping us deliver these results and to our stakeholders for their continued support. With that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brad Heffern : Hey, everyone. Christie Kelly : Hi, Brad. Brad Heffern : Hi, Christie. Sumit, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have seen an increase in cap rates in certain categories. Can you give more color there and are there differences by credit quality or geography? Sumit Roy : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Brad. Good question. I think the most obvious difference in cap rates \u2013 increasing cap rates we see is in the industrial sector and more so here in the U.S. than in the international markets. I would say if I was asked to quantify what this change is in terms of what we were seeing in the third and fourth quarter of last year to what we started to see in the first quarter and beyond of this year, I would say it\u2019s in the tune of 25 to 50 basis points of increase in cap rates on the industrial sector. We are also starting to see on the retail side some of the transactions that were struck again in the fourth quarter of last year with potential levered buyers coming back. And certainty of close is taking on paramount importance with regards to the sellers and they are coming back at slightly higher cap rates. We see this more on the larger dollar retail acquisition opportunities, not so much on the QSR and smaller opportunities. But we are starting to see movement higher on the retail side, but it is not as dominant and it\u2019s not as widespread as we see it on the industrial side. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thank you for that. And then are you seeing any companies that potentially wouldn\u2019t have been interested in sale leaseback in the past come in just given the higher cost of alternative forms of financing? Sumit Roy : Yes. I think part of it is that sale leaseback may potentially be a better avenue to raise capital and monetize their real estate, but I think part of it is also the maturation of the sale leaseback market, especially here in the U.S. We are starting to see first time operators engaging in sale leaseback conversations and a lot of it is not necessarily being generated by activist investors coming into play. A lot of it is organic. This is becoming part of their balance sheet management strategy going forward. And some of these are much larger than what we have typically seen in years past. And when I say that, I mean with $1 billion in front rather than $1 million. And to us, it is a function of the maturation of the sale leaseback market and of course, also what is happening on the CMBS and secured debt markets today. Brad Heffern : Okay, thank you. Operator : Sure. Next, we will go to Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Christie Kelly : Hi, Greg. Sumit Roy : Greg, you maybe on mute. Operator : Yes, Greg. Your line is open. Greg McGinniss : I certainly was. Thank you so much, Sumit. So, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Christie, the line of credit can now support a pretty significant level of acquisition activity. Just curious how you are thinking about maybe debt raises through the balance of the year, where do you anticipate you could raise debt and then thoughts on sterling and euro debt versus dollar debt at this point? Christie Kelly : Yes. Thanks for that, Greg. Yes, we are very excited about the renewal of our $4.25 billion credit facility. The team just did a great job, and we\u2019ve got great support from a lineup of banks. In terms of indicative pricing right now, 10-year U.S. treasuries, we just received this morning above 4%, call it, 4.2%, 4.3%. When we look at sterling, we\u2019re probably in 3.7% range. And then euro-related debt, high 2s, 2.8% to 3%. And as you know, part of our strategy is to really take advantage of the European execution from a liability perspective. And so as part of our capital strategy, we\u2019d be looking to execute in sterling. And depending on how things pan out throughout the rest of the year, potentially execute from a euro perspective as well. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And then in terms of how you might be thinking about raising debt this year, I mean, do you guys feel a need to get more permanent financing versus using the revolver? Or are you comfortable just based on where the acquisition guidance is just continuing to load up there? Christie Kelly : I think what you can expect from us, Greg, is to just really be consistent as we executed, for example, in April with the private placement of approximately $800 million. We have a delayed draw on that. So the paydown is in June. And as you mentioned, we\u2019ve got our revolver, and we also have our commercial paper program that is even further pricing inside the revolver. So we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity here in front of us to fund our acquisition volume and do so within the range of guidance. Greg McGinniss : Okay, thank you very much. Christie Kelly : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Next, we will go to Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Your line is open. Nicholas Joseph : Thank you. Maybe just following up on that line of questioning. Just with the sterling debt issuance and the other capital raising, how hedged are you from a cash flow and asset exposure perspective today? Christie Kelly : Hi, Nick. Yes. So from a hedging perspective, we have hedges in place that we\u2019ve executed both from an interest rate perspective. The team executed those back in the 2020 time period in June. And as you can imagine, we\u2019re in the money. And it was very well designed as it relates to the current environment. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. And then just on external growth. I mean just given the 1Q activity and then the casino deal under contract, what were your thoughts on moving acquisition guidance with this earnings release? Sumit Roy : Nick, sorry, you cut off. Could you repeat that last question, please? Nicholas Joseph : Sure. Can you hear me? Sumit Roy : Yes, I can. Go ahead. Nicholas Joseph : Yes. So the question was just on maintained acquisition guidance, just given the pace of acquisitions year-to-date and then also with the casino under contract for later in the year, if there are thoughts of moving up the acquisition guidance or just given kind of the uncertainty in the market, how that all blended together in your thinking? Sumit Roy : Yes. So Nick, if you recall, when we first came out with our guidance, this was in late October, I think, of last year, which was very unusual for us, and a lot of what was driving that thinking then was making sure that people were able to underwrite what this merger was going to mean for the pro forma company. And we had come out with a number of $5 billion, approximately $5 billion. We haven\u2019t changed that. And like you\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve obviously made the announcement subsequent to that initial guidance of a $1.7 billion transaction. And what I can share with you, Nick, is not all of that $1.7 billion was contemplated when we had first come out with the $5 billion. In fact, we weren\u2019t even sure we had a deal at that time. So could that $5 billion go up? Yes. But what I \u2013 what keeps us a little bit on the sidelines is this continued volatility that we are seeing on the capital markets side. And from a pure sourcing perspective, as you can see from the numbers that we\u2019ve posted, from a \u2013 the next 4 to 5-month pipeline perspective, I can continue to share with you that the momentum is there. It is incredibly positive. And what sort of keeps us sort of hedging is what\u2019s going to happen in the last 4 to 5 months if this continued volatility remains. We are very comfortable with the $5 billion number, and it\u2019s actually, we say, above $5 billion. And I think we can also go so far as to say that not all of that $1.7 billion, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, was contemplated when we came out with the numbers that we did. Nicholas Joseph : Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Thanks, Nick. Christie Kelly : Nick, I just wanted to follow-up, too, to make sure that I captured the breadth of your question. I also wanted to just share that as we\u2019ve talked about, that we use foreign debt to serve as a natural hedge on our foreign assets. And probably the only other thing you\u2019d be interested in is we also have FX forwards in place to hedge some of our foreign earnings. Operator : Okay, alright. Next, we will go to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Can you give us an update on the VEREIT merger and how the G&A synergies are trending so far? Sumit Roy : Sure. I\u2019ll start off. And then Christie, if you wouldn\u2019t mind just addressing the run rate on the synergies. With regards to the integration itself, I think it has gone according to plan. I would even go so far as to say it\u2019s ahead of plan. The two companies are integrated from an organizational perspective. The personnel have integrated into their various teams. Common procedures and processes and controls have been adopted. And we are clearly seeing that on the acquisition front, on the asset management front and the property management front, etcetera. So I think organizationally, we are where we were hoping to be. In terms of synergies, I\u2019ll let Christie take that question. Christie Kelly : Thanks, Sumit. So we had shared during the transaction that we were focused on executing $45 million to $55 million in synergies. And from the perspective of where we are right now, we\u2019re tracking towards the higher end of that range and well ahead of plan. Michael Goldsmith : That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, more focused on Europe. Given what\u2019s transpiring there, can you provide an update on the health of the investment landscape in Europe broadly and then maybe touch on some of the specific regions? And then within that, your European portfolio is more concentrated in certain retailers. So how do you \u2013 over time, how do you look to diversify that to kind of spread \u2013 to spread out the exposure? Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure, Michael. Very good questions. Look, I think by design, we had chosen to enter into Western Europe. And we, by design, chose the UK primarily because of the ease of affordability of our cost of capital and processes and tax regime, etcetera, etcetera. You\u2019re absolutely right that we have chosen to continue to work with some very large operators, and that investment pipeline has continued to be a major source of our growth of what is today a $5 billion portfolio. The good news here is the operators that we are partnering with they are very, very large. And so there is a tremendous amount of runway for us to continue to do the consolidation. I think there was an element of your question that also touched on, given what is happening in Eastern Europe, how are we impacted? How are our operators impacted? What I can share with you is, as of right now, all of the operators that we have done business with in Europe, none of them have operations today. None of them have operations in Russia, Ukraine or any of the adjacent countries that are potentially being impacted by what\u2019s playing out in Eastern Europe. The only operator ironically that does have some element of exposure to Russia is actually Couche-Tard that has about 36 assets, which is less than 1% of their overall footprint \u2013 global footprint that is based in Russia. And outside of that, none of our operators today have operations in either of those impacted countries. So we have a tremendous amount of pipeline. We have a fair amount of runway to not only continue to grow with the operators that we\u2019ve established, but also as we branch out into new countries with other dominant operators in those countries, and some of which, as you can tell, Carrefour was a brand new name for us, and we did the sale-leaseback in Spain. We have continued to grow that name. And as we continue to add more and more countries, and even within countries, as we get more comfortable with the landscape and operators, you\u2019ll start to see a few other very large names get added to our client registry, so, so far, so good. And by design, we\u2019ve stayed on the western side of Europe. And those businesses continue to do well. Operator : Okay, alright. We will go to our next question, Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess, it\u2019s good afternoon out there, as well. Christie Kelly : Hi, there, Haendel. Haendel St. Juste: Hi, there. So you guys sold $122 million in the first quarter, you said mostly VEREIT assets. But I guess I\u2019m curious how much more is there left to sell in that platform that you\u2019ve identified? And I guess why were there so many vacant properties there to lease? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Yes. It\u2019s about \u2013 so I\u2019ll answer your last question first, Haendel. There is about 156 assets that are vacant in our portfolio close to 11,500 assets. So it\u2019s not significant, as you can tell which is clearly why we have 98.6% occupancy. Look, for us, it is \u2013 this quarter happened to be one where of all the assets sold, about 97%, 98% \u2013 I believe it was $118 million $119 million of the $122 million were vacant asset sales. And even that number was largely dominated by two industrial assets that we sold vacant where we were able to strike very good total return profiles. This is going to continue to ebb and flow. There\u2019ll be quarters where we have some occupied assets that we have opportunistically decided to sell. And clearly, selling vacant assets is very much part and parcel of our business. And when we do sell vacant assets, we give you a total return profile on what is the unlevered return that we were able to achieve, which this first quarter was north of 9% on an unlevered basis. So these are assets that we may have held for 10, 12, 15 years, have generated a fair amount of cash flow. And even when sold vacant, especially in inflationary environments, it allows us to create and capture the kind of returns that we are posting. But the point I want to make and I want to leave with you, Haendel, is selling vacant assets is absolutely part of our business. We go through an asset management analysis where we try to figure out what is the most economic \u2013 what is the most positive outcome in terms of the economics of selling the asset, re-leasing the asset, repositioning the asset or entering into a negotiation with the existing client. And once we sort of go through that, we make the determination to go down one of these paths. And that\u2019s what drives our thinking in terms of how we decide whether to sell vacant assets or occupied assets. And that will continue to be the mantra that dictates our asset management strategy going forward. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe some comments on business \u2013 thinking of business overall, I understand you\u2019re not in a position of having to sell assets, but just curious if you\u2019re maybe thinking a bit differently here, maybe selling a bit more in light of the movement in rates? Sumit Roy : So Haendel, do you think what we\u2019re experiencing today is going to continue on? Because, yes, if what we have experienced in the market more recently sort of creates this disconnect between private market valuations and public market valuations, and obviously, selling assets becomes very much part and parcel of our strategy. Truth be told, Haendel, we\u2019ve never, outside of those very small pockets of time, i.e., when the pandemic first started, where we had a few weeks where there was a dislocation. For a sustained period, we\u2019ve never encountered a scenario where asset prices were being valued in the private market higher than what our public market valuation indicated. But if that were to play out, hypothetically speaking, we would not be averse to raising capital, if needed, through asset sales. This is, again, I think, will accrue to our benefit given the quality of assets that we have being able to assemble especially over the last 10 years, and more specifically, over the last 3 to 4 years. So that continues to remain a strategy but one that we hope doesn\u2019t play out because I think the only scenario where I can see that happening is a macro environment where things are incredibly uncertain. And I hope that, that doesn\u2019t play out that way. But look, it\u2019s absolutely a theoretical strategy that we can lean on if needed. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. One more on the guidance, maybe for Christie, you reversed the $10 million of movie-theater-related reserves. I\u2019m curious what\u2019s left that opportunity bucket here today and what\u2019s contemplated in the guide. And maybe a question on the lower end of guidance, run-rate FFO was closer to $0.95. You didn\u2019t raise the lower end. Maybe help us square that a bit? Thanks. Christie Kelly : Yes. I think certainly, Haendel, I mean, in terms of the overall reserves that we have remaining from the COVID time period, it\u2019s approximately $30 million. And the majority of those deferral arrangements are going to be in effect as of July. And so in accordance with our guidelines and the like, we will be ensuring over the next 6 months towards the end of the year that we\u2019re collecting in accordance with our deferral arrangements. And so as it relates to guidance, we really don\u2019t have anything else factored in of note into the midpoint of our guidance. Haendel St. Juste: Okay, thanks. Operator : Okay, we will move to our next question. Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Yes. Great. Maybe on the tenant side, Sumit, earlier, you referenced it briefly, but obviously, you have a lot of individual tenants. What\u2019s your impression on how they are doing? To what extent they can pass along inflation impacts to their customers? And how that ultimately impacts their ability to pay rent? Sumit Roy : Yes. Look, it is certainly a story that is playing out very differently for those that are well-capitalized businesses versus those that tend to be smaller operators in this high inflationary environment. We had Neil\u2019s team, the research team, do an analysis on our top 150 clients. And they represent about 85% of our rent. And we were like very focused on what is going to happen to their balance sheet, their ability to pay in the event that interest rates were to rise 300 basis points from where it is currently. And, this is a big and, they didn\u2019t have the ability to pass through any of those increased costs that they were bearing on to their customers, which is a highly unlikely scenario, but we were trying to figure out what would happen in that particular scenario for us. And it was 11 of these operators of the 150 representing less than 5% of our rent where the coverages fell below 1x. So, we feel like \u2013 again, by design, we have created a client registry that\u2019s predominantly made up of very well capitalized operators. But those one-off operators \u2013 and Caitlin you are right, we have 1,000 different clients. So, we certainly have a few one-off operators that tend to be smaller operators. It is going to be more difficult for them to be able to absorb this and their inability to pass through their costs. But we have had a few general merchandising stores. We have had a few folks who are going to \u2013 who have actually talked about increasing EBIT margins because of their ability to pass-through a lot of these costs. And predominantly, our client registries made up of those types of folks. So, yes, hypothetically, Caitlin, the smaller operators will suffer in this environment and may not make it. But thankfully, we don\u2019t have too much exposure to that, and it is very small in terms of percentage of our overall rent. Caitlin Burrows : Great. Thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up to an earlier question regarding that $45 million to $55 million of VEREIT-related G&A synergies. Christie, could you just clarify to what extent Realty Income is already at a good run rate, or how much further there is to go when you think I will get there, just trying to think of the cadence and timing there? Christie Kelly : Yes. I think, Caitlin, we are already over the midpoint of our guidance for the first year of execution. And to that point, we probably have 10% to 15% more to go. There is essentially some lag associated with timing that will also spill into 2023, but we have made excellent progress as a team. Caitlin Burrows : Thanks. Christie Kelly : Thanks Caitlin. Operator : Next we will go to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ronald Kamdem : Yes. A couple of quick ones for me. Just going back on sort of the gaming acquisition, I think you have mentioned in the opening comments still on track. Can you remind us what else sort of needs to be done before that\u2019s done and dusted? And the follow-up is just, have you sort of gotten \u2013 received more interest in sort of the gaming side? And is that an opportunity? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Hi Ron. Yes. So, the biggest element to closing this transaction is the licensing process, and we are well in the midst of going through that process. We have submitted our application. It is being reviewed by the Massachusetts Gaming Group. And we are very hopeful that by fourth quarter, we will be in a position to close this transaction. But that really is the one outstanding element to be able to close this transaction, but so far so good. Everything that we are hearing, everything that we have received in terms of MGC\u2019s response to our initial application has been quite positive. So, we feel pretty good about that. In terms of the industry itself, no surprise, we are getting a lot of inbounds from potential sale-leaseback opportunities. And the team is reviewing them one at a time. But our thesis around this particular space remains the same. We want to partner with the best-in-class operators and find assets that are truly one-of-a-kind, just like we did with the Boston asset. And if at a very high level, those criterias are met, we will absolutely continue to increase our exposure to this particular sector. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And if I could just sneak in one more. Just earlier in the call, you made some comments about sort of the top 150 tenants in the portfolio and 85% of rents. And when I think about aspirations of doing these larger sale-leaseback opportunities, just you take a step back, how many of those clients potentially do you think are \u2013 would be interested this would be the right solution for them versus it sort of have to be new relationships, new tenants for sort of these larger sale-leaseback deals in the future? Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. So Ron, I mean you have seen us grow our existing relationships to areas where they start to dominate our shareholder registry. So, for instance, I will give you a perfect example. We did the first sale-leaseback with Dollar General. This was, I believe in 2015- 2016 timeframe, and it was maybe $130 million, $140 million sale-leaseback. We subsequently continued to grow our opportunity with Dollar General through multiple sale-leasebacks. It\u2019s a similar story with 7-Eleven. A lot of these clients that you see in our top 20 have grown over multiple years and they continue to have ambitious growth profile. So, that channel of growth remains for us. Then we also have the ability to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a large way with clients like Wynn. These are asset classes that tend to be very large. But again, given that we are about a $57 billion, $58 billion company today, it is going to register as a 3.5% client. And clearly, we have said this very openly that in the event, Wynn decides to continue to execute and grow their footprint beyond the two locations that they currently have, we would love to continue to partner with them. And so this is a function of being able to do first time sale-leasebacks in a big way. And now that we are of the size that we are, our ability to absorb those \u2013 and when I say big, I mean $1 billion sale-leaseback, even multiple billion dollar sale-leasebacks that has grown over the last few years and especially post the VEREIT merger. Ronald Kamdem : Helpful. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Next we will go to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes. Hey everyone. Sumit, just wanted to follow-up on your comment that cap rates tend to lag, interest rate moves by six months. So, I guess why not maybe slow down acquisitions a bit and kind of weight maybe towards the back half of the year to kind of get that better cap rate? Sumit Roy : Yes. Hi Josh. I wish our business was a spigot where you could switch it off and turn it back on at a moment\u2019s notice. Unfortunately, our business doesn\u2019t work quite like that. When you think about how we source opportunities and how we create a pipeline of opportunities and what is the timing that it takes from making a decision to pursuing a particular transaction and then closing it, it could take anywhere between four months to six months from start to finish. So, unless you have a crystal ball, it is very, very difficult to be able to sort of do exactly what you suggested, which would have been perfect, if we could. The other thing I would tell you is there is a lag even in our cost of capital. When you have volatile situations like this, but you are seeing opportunities that seem very well priced on a pure real estate underwriting in terms of replacement costs, in terms of price per pound, and you think about the leases that we are able to capture with the clients that are engaging in these types of transactions, you obviously build into your underwriting a particular buffer. And hopefully, we have been conservative enough where we are still being able to capture positive healthy spreads to our cost of capital while continuing to enhance the \u2013 our basic AFFO per share growth as well as our client registry with new relationships. So, it\u2019s very difficult. We had a different mindset over the next six months to nine months, which said, hey, the world is going to fall apart. We absolutely will pull in our horns just like we did in that very first quarter right after the \u2013 it was actually the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic hit where we slowed down our ability to sort of continue looking at transactions, and truth be told, even the market there, the transaction market sort of went silent for a bit, just because people are very unsure of how things are going to play out. But that I have already shared with you is not the case. Sourcing remains very healthy. And we feel like even with the appropriate flexing of our own cost of capital, we are able to grow our business in a manner that is very much aligned with our acquisition strategy. But Josh, I will be very honest, if our views change, we will stop continuing to build the pipeline. But that is not the case right now. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then maybe another follow-up about expanding into other countries in Europe, what is it that get you comfortable to expand outside the UK and Spain? Sumit Roy : The right opportunities. There are already a set of countries that we have preapproved, so to speak, internally and have shared with our Board that there are countries that we would like to be able to grow in the event the right opportunities come along. We have identified the businesses that we would like to do business with. We have identified the clients. We have identified the fact that these are businesses that will continue to thrive even in cycles like the one that we are experiencing. And if those boxes are checked and we are able to sort of strike the right balance in terms of spreads, etcetera, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to allow us to continue to expand our geographic footprint in Western Europe. Joshua Dennerlein : Great. Thanks guys. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Next we will go to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open. John Massocca : Good afternoon. Christie Kelly : Hi John. John Massocca : So, I think historically, you have kind of looked at long-term same-store growth. I understand you have a target for guidance this year. But long-term same-store growth is being right around 1%. And some of the things you are seeing in terms of maybe rent on renewals and just the effects of increasing prices across the real estate world, in general, increase that outlook, I mean is that enough to move the needle, or is it just \u2013 it\u2019s obviously going to primarily be the rent bumps you have in place. But I mean can that be big enough given the lease expiration schedule to move that up maybe noticeably? Sumit Roy : Well, John, that\u2019s what makes us different, right. I mean if you look at our world, vis-\u00e0-vis our peers, we are at right around 8 years, 8.5 years. And if you look at our lease maturity schedule and I think I said this during my prepared remarks that 12% of our leases are going to renew over the next 2.5 years. And so it does \u2013 if we can keep this momentum, I don\u2019t know if it will be 106%, but the other thing I would say about that 106% is it\u2019s effectively net increases. And so if we can keep it in that ZIP code, that will become a major growth driver for our business, and it will become an internal growth driver of our business, especially if we continue down this highly inflationary environment. The other good news is if you think about our international expansion, a lot of those leases tend to be CPI-adjusted leases. And they don\u2019t tend to have this collar \u2013 a ceiling and a floor that we experience here, but it\u2019s a relative comment. I would say the vast majority of CPI leases that we have here in the U.S. tend to have a collar. And I would say maybe one-third to even 40% of the leases in the international markets tend to be \u2013 basically do not have a collar around it, and they are very much tied to CPI growth. And so I think all of that will start to percolate through our portfolio and will help us drive more internal growth than what we have historically experienced in our business. And we think of this as an opportunity, and we have been talking about asset management now for about 5 years, 6 years in anticipation of what we are now starting to experience as a company. And so look, we think we are very positively set up to take advantage of this situation. And it then helps us alleviate some of the pressure of just growing through external measures, which of course, is also something that the team is doing very well. John Massocca : And then on the external growth side of things, obviously, you are a bigger company, so you would expect this to grow. But the development pipeline seems to kind of keep taking legs up. I mean is there something specific driving that? Sumit Roy : Yes. It\u2019s by design, John. We want development to continue to tick up because we do get more spread doing development. And this allows us to continue to be the one-stop solution that our clients are looking for. And just to be super clear, we are talking about build-to-suit on 99% of our development. So, I mean\u2026 John Massocca : Are you talking about client demand, or is that something just you haven\u2019t been exploiting that market maybe 3 years ago the same way you are today? Sumit Roy : John, they are build-to-suit. So, by definition, they are being driven by our clients coming to us or coming to a developer and saying we would like to have you develop here in this particular location because we would like to enter into a long-term lease. And we have either relationships directly with our clients who then ask us to work with the developer or with some developers who have asked us to become their capital source as a permanent takeout. And that is what\u2019s allowing us to continue to enhance our development pipeline. So, this is absolutely being driven by the clients, not by us. This was just a hole in our overall strategy that we are now addressing in a meaningful way. John Massocca : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Thanks John. Operator : Next we will go to Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Linda Tsai : Yes. Hi. In terms of driving higher internal growth that you just mentioned, is there a range you would like to target or move towards over time? Sumit Roy : 10%. Linda, I am not trying to be flippant, but look, our intention is to try to drive that up. Some of it will naturally come with the expansion in asset types. There are certain asset types that lend themselves to higher organic growth. That was part of the attraction that we had with investing in industrial assets, and we saw that. And some of these other asset types, just like I said, do have a higher profile than the 1% that we have traditionally been able to get in the space that we had targeted historically. So, could I see that tick up, that\u2019s the hope with more international acquisition, with more industrial, with more development where we can create more bespoke leases. If we can get that 1% to 1.5% to 2%, that would be a major uplift and a source of internal growth. But that\u2019s not going to happen overnight. It\u2019s going to take us time, and it\u2019s going to take intentionality, which we certainly have. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then just to follow-up, any general update on the theater business? To the extent you have seen more recovery, would you look to sell some of these assets? Sumit Roy : We are not quite there where we would want to sell our theater portfolio, Linda. In fact, all indications have been all trend lines have indicated that the theater business is getting back to a strong footing despite all of the noise that we hear about the theater business and PBOD [ph] and all of that. In fact, I was looking at some numbers in the first quarter of 2022. We are back to about 75% of 2019 levels. And so clearly, this is a business that is largely driven by content. We are also very encouraged by the pipeline of big-tent movies that are going to be released over the next two months to three months. We are very hopeful that, that will translate to more attendance. And the good news is a couple of these large operators like Regal and AMC are cash flowing positive on the assets that we own. So, I think all of that leads us to believe that this industry as we had hoped and our hypothesis was is sort of on demand. Having said all of that, we also did a fair amount of downside scenario analysis where we looked at some of these locations and we feel like we have the ability, the capital, the relationships to reposition these assets in the event that the business doesn\u2019t play out. I think the wrong economic decision today would be to sell some of these assets at what I would consider to be fire sale prices. And again, just to remind everyone, 82% of our portfolio is in the top two quartiles of performance for both these operators. So, we feel very good about the theater business, but more specifically about the portfolio that we own. And so the decision to sell, though a theoretical one and has been considered, is one that we are not in a position to execute on given some of what I just said. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for any concluding remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to speaking at the upcoming NAREIT conference. Thank you all. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea Behr, Manager of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. Andrea Behr : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Also joining us on our call is Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President-Corporate Finance, together with our One Team leaders. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Andrea. Welcome everyone. Cultivating strong and enduring relationships with all our stakeholders is foundational to the success of our business. And I'd like to thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to all my Realty Income colleagues who continue make significant contributions towards our growth initiatives, while serving our clients and all stakeholders as one Realty Income team. We are pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business amidst an uncertain macro environment, which we believe once again, demonstrates the stability of our business model and its ability to thrive irrespective of the economic cycle. The strength of our global investment pipeline has allowed us to invest over $3.2 billion in high-quality real estate in the first half of the year, including approximately $1.7 billion during the second quarter. Given this momentum, we are increasing our 2022 acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion. On the topic of acquisitions, I'd like to mention two key developments that we are observing in the marketplace. First, as demonstrated by the weighted average 5.7% cash cap rate, we were able to achieve on our investments in the second quarter, cap rates are moving higher in our target markets. Our second quarter cap rate ticked higher compared to the 5.6% and 5.4% cap rates we achieved in the previous two quarters. The positive correlation between cap rates and interest rate is also evident in our acquisition pipeline. Second, as a corollary to rising debt and equity costs that have impacted much of our competition, the pipeline of acquisition opportunities materializing for us at accretive spreads continues to grow. As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. On a straight line basis, we estimate our second quarter cap rate to be approximately 6.2%. And generally, the difference between cash and straight line cap rates ranges between 50 and 70 basis points in any given period. Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $26 billion in this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume to approximately $60 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 5% of sourced volume year-to-date. During the second quarter as percentage of revenue, approximately 39% of acquisition volume was leased to investment-grade rated clients. We remain committed to our underwriting principles of partnering with well capitalized clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Our international investment volume continues to comprise a significant percentage of our total volume, representing 41% of global volume in the second quarter at a cash cap rate of approximately 5.8%. We are encouraged that our size, scale and access to well-priced capital provides us with the platform and currency to actively deploy capital as we build continued momentum heading into 2023. It was also an active quarter with regard to dispositions. We sold 70 properties, generating net sale proceeds of $150 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.3%. Year-to-date, we have sold 104 properties with net sales proceeds totaling $272 million, generating an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.4%. Capital recycling continues to be a value accretive activity for us. And importantly, the unlevered returns we have been able to deliver speak to the attractive risk adjusted investment profile of our properties that have gone through our full investment cycle. Our diligent underwriting process, exposure to high-quality credit clients and the inherent quality of our real estate continue to deliver consistent performance. At the end of the second quarter, our occupancy was 98.9%, the highest occupancy rate we have achieved in over 10 years. Based on our current occupancy rates and client profile, we are increasing our year-end 2022 occupancy guidance to over 98%. During the second quarter, we re-leased 193 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 105.6%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.9%. At quarter-end, 43.2% of our portfolios annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Further, our properties leased to clients on our portfolio watch list represents less than 4% of our portfolios analyze contractual rent, which is largely consistent with the low percentages we have seen so far this year. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 3% year-to-date. With a continued strong operations performance of our portfolio, we are increasing our guidance for same-store rent growth to approximately 2% for 2022. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. During the second quarter, our business generated $0.97 of AFFO per share, representing 10.2% year-over-year growth. The growth engine of our Company revolves around accretive acquisitions. Our investment goals are supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and favorable cost of capital, which remain competitive advantages for us in the net lease industry. We finished the quarter well within our target leverage ratios with net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3 times or 5.2 times on a pro forma basis, giving annualized effects to net investment activity during the quarter. It was another active quarter for us on the capital raising front. As we issued approximately $1.8 billion of long-term and permanent capital, including nearly $1.1 billion of equity through our ATM program and a \u00a3600 million private placement note offering which priced at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.22% with a blended tenure of 10.5 years. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $1 billion of commercial paper and revolver borrowings net of cash. Our outstanding CPE and revolver borrowings essentially represent our only variable rate debt exposure across a total debt principal balance of almost $16 billion. As Sumit mentioned previously, our ability to access well-priced capital is a competitive advantage and we took steps during the quarter to further bolster this capacity. As previously announced in April this year, we recasted and upsized our multicurrency revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $4.25 billion. Subsequent to quarter-end, we upsized our U.S. Commercial Paper Program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established our Euro Commercial Paper Program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion Commercial Paper Programs for which our revolving credit facility serves as a liquidity backstop will give us the flexibility to efficiently finance our short-term funding needs at materially lower rates than comparable facility borrowings. Given the momentum we continue to see in our investment activities in Europe, the establishment of a Euro program was a strategic goal of ours this year. And it will serve as an efficient tool for us to take advantage of the comparably lower all-in commercial paper rates in the Euro market. With the health of our portfolio and investment progress achieved year-to-date, balanced alongside the timing of capital deployment and continued capital markets volatility, we affirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing nearly 9% annual growth at the mid-point. From a dividend perspective as the monthly dividend company, consistent quarterly increases in dividend reflects the confidence we have in the cash flow generated capacity of our business. In June, we increased our dividend for the 116th time in our company\u2019s history. And last month, we declared our 625th consecutive common stock monthly dividend. From a sustainability perspective, further in June, we published our green bond allocation report, and I\u2019m pleased to report that the net proceeds from our inaugural green bond offering have been fully allocated to eligible green projects in accordance with the criteria outlined in our green financing framework. From a merger perspective lastly, I am pleased to report that we have completed the integration of our VEREIT merger, which culminated in the conversion to a single ERP system for the combined entities during the second quarter. This could not have been accomplished so seamlessly without the commitment and dedication of our talented one team. And finally, we remain on track to achieve the expected $45 million to $55 million of annualized run rate cost energies we initially shared over a year ago when we announced the merger. And now, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christie. Coming off a record 2021 from an investment standpoint, I\u2019m proud that our team has only accelerated the momentum this year. Most importantly, we believe the future is bright as our positioning to further gain market share in the investment arena grows. Indeed, the advantages afforded to us given our size scale and access to well priced capital have rarely been more pronounced than they are today. And we look forward to continuing to capitalize on this in the days ahead. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Christie Kelly : Hi, Michael. Michael Goldsmith : Hello, good. Thank you for taking my question. First question is on cap rates moving higher, the markets getting a little bit better. You have a larger acquisition team due to the VEREIT merger. How can you be a little bit more aggressive or take advantage of the improving markets, just given that combined with there are some uncertainties in kind of the borrowing markets as well. Sumit Roy : That\u2019s a good question, Michael, because there are competing variables in this market today. You\u2019re absolutely right. That cap rates are moving in the right direction. There are adjusting a lot quicker than I had originally anticipated. We do have a much bigger team. And with the VEREIT merger, some of the team members that we have inherited, they are definitely producing and focusing on a certain area of the high real market that is actually resulting in transactions for us. The offset to that, however, is the capital market. Look, on a relative basis, we are doing very well. If you look at our tenure unsecured bond spreads, they have moved, I would say approximately 85 basis points. You look at our peers, our net lease peers with a BBB rating, it\u2019s moved 120 basis points to 150 basis points. If you look at our cost of equity, it is essentially unchanged from the beginning of the year. But if you look at our net lease peers, they\u2019ve dropped by about 1.8 times. So those are the positive momentums, but it is true also that our cost of capital overall has also increased. And the question really is around, can we generate the right spreads to move the needle on the overall AFFO per share growth? And the answer is yes. But as you know, there is an adjustment period, which is why we have increased our acquisition guidance to over $6 billion from over $5 billion as a testament to what we are seeing in terms of benefits accruing to us, based on some of what I just discussed. We are starting to see a lot more transactions coming back to us those that we were not willing to price at the levels that the sellers were expecting when they initially brought it to us, are now coming back with an adjusted cap rate, which works. It is also true that the overall team has been able to just source more and those are sort of shown in the sourcing volumes that, that we have shared with you of $60 billion year-to-date. But with interest rate movements and more importantly, the velocity at which these interest rates have moved, the spreads continue to be right around at 110 basis points, 111 basis points year-to-date, which is slightly below our overall average. So that\u2019s the reason why that this positive momentum is being reflected in higher acquisition volume, but not necessarily translating into higher earnings guidance. Michael Goldsmith : Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, European acquisitions were about 40% this quarter. And so that represents a bit of an acceleration from what we\u2019ve seen. So is 40% kind of the right mix for next year or at least the second half into next year like how are you thinking about the U.S. versus Europe mix going forward? Sumit Roy : Yes. Michael, it fluctuates. I mean there have been quarters actually where the international acquisition number has been not the 50% of the overall volume. And as we start to grow into newer markets, et cetera, obviously, the total addressable market continues to increase for us. And as we become much more mature in each one of these newer markets, the sourced volume as well as which translates to closed volume will increase. But I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that, at this point in time, we should be thinking anything north of this 40% number 41% is what we achieved in the second quarter, as being it should be the guiding composition of the overall acquisition numbers going forward. There will be quarters where we\u2019ll do more just like we\u2019ve done in the past, but 40% seems to be the right number. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Mike. Operator : The next question is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Christie Kelly : Hi, Nick. Nick Joseph : Thank you. Hi, how are you? You touched on cap rates obviously expanding a bit. Wondering if you could break that out between international versus the U.S. where you\u2019ve seen more expansion, where you\u2019ve seen more stickiness or any differences between the two. Sumit Roy : Sure. That\u2019s a great question, Nick, and welcome back to our space. I would say that the movement in cap rates here in the U.S. are certainly much more pronounced than what we have seen in the international markets. And it is largely a function of the Fed being a lot more aggressive than the ECB or the Bank of England have been. Having said that, we just saw an announcement earlier today that the Bank of England has moved its interest rates 50 basis points. So we do see that translating to higher cap rates in the UK as well as in the rest of Continental Europe. So just to quantify some of these movements, I would say that depending on the product, and when I say retail, you can go from groceries, which have moved the most because they had become the most aggressive, they\u2019ve moved up about a 100 basis points to some of the other industries that we focus on within the retail space, I would quantify that movement is being right around 25 basis points to 50 basis points. And you should start to see that being reflected in the subsequent quarters and the acquisition cap rates \u2013 cash cap rates that we are going to share with the market going forward. In the \u2013 in Europe, we have also seen movement, but it hasn\u2019t been quite as pronounced maybe 5 basis points to 10 basis points. On the industrial side, the movement has been a bit more visible 25 basis points to 50 basis points, similar to what we experienced here in the U.S. But I would say the industrial market has continued to see an expansion on cap rates. And I would say, from beginning to end, maybe you circa 50 basis points of movement on average. Now, obviously, there are certain markets where the movement has been a lot, lot less than that Inland Empire comes to mind. But the more secondary tertiary markets, you have seen a more pronounced movement than it could be even north of 50 to 75 basis. Nick Joseph : Thanks. That's very helpful. And then you mentioned deals coming back, do those fall out of contract, did they \u2013 did the seller just not get the pricing? What are you see broadly as those \u2013 as you get a second crack at some of them? Sumit Roy : Yes. It's largely buyers that rely on the debt capital markets either the CMBS market or the bank loan market. You are in New York, you know what the money market, the big banks, the BofAs, the JPMorgans, the Wells, I'm not going to say that they have a moratorium on new loans, but it is much more difficult for them to create new bank debt or increased revolvers, et cetera, for more distress credit. So the overall debt market has sort of become a lot more expensive for some of these levered buyers. And that's what we've seen is that they're no longer being able to honor the original cap rates that transactions were being struck at. And of course, we chose not to pursue those transactions at those given pricing. And so when they do come back to us and as long as we like the transaction, it was just a pricing discussion. We are being able to now, either honor the cap rate that we had or even expand out those cap rates to reflect current market conditions. But the fact that the surety of close has become so much more important for the sellers today is clearly prevalent in a lot of the discussions that we are having with the sellers today. Nick Joseph : Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Connor Siversky with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Christie Kelly : Hi, Connor. Connor Siversky : Thanks for having me on the call. I'm curious on this cap rate discussion, and I'm appreciate your comments that you have a correlation between rising rates and subsequent impact on cap rates. But I'm wondering if you've ever been able to establish what the lag looks like. For example, with a 25 basis point increase in rates, how long does it take for that to reflect in cap rates? And then second to that, are you seeing that relationship accelerate, given that you are seeing some of these lending partners shut down their operations? Sumit Roy : Yes, it's a great question. And unfortunately, if we were in a lab where we could control all variables that sort of drive this correlation, it would be a lot easier of an answer to give you. Historically, when we've done these correlations, we have found that the lag to be anywhere between nine to perhaps even as long as 12 months. I was a lot more skeptical coming into this particular situation coming into this year and seeing the rising interest rate environment. Just because of the \u2013 the sheer volume of capital that has come into our space on the institutional side. And I was a bit hesitant to continue to say, hey, it's going to be this nine to 12 month lag before cap rates start to reflect the new environment, because of this wealth of capital. However, what I didn't take into account was the debt markets adjusting as quickly as they did. And even this new capital that has come into our space, both on the private equity side, as well as on the public side of the equation. The debt markets adjusted a lot faster. And therefore the pullback from these newer buyers in our space has been a lot more acute, which has resulted in cap rates adjusting a lot faster. I mean, we've had a rising interest rate environment now for the last six months. And we are already starting to see cap rates adjust 25 to 50 basis points. And like I said, in the grocery sector, we saw sale leasebacks being done in the low fours that are now coming back and being done in the low fives to mid fives. So it's not a constant Connor that I can point to. It is a reflection of the environment that you're faced with, but it's a good thing for us truth be told that cap rates can adjust, as quickly as they have in a rising interest rate environment. I just hope that the corollary is not true. Connor Siversky : Got it. That's a very interesting color. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Christie Kelly : Hi, Haendel. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, there. Hello, everyone. So I guess, I'm curious on your assessment of the non-high grade portion of the market right now. Curious, I understand, it's not a focus of yours, but you do dabble and do have exposure there. Curious, of the relative attractiveness of high grade versus perhaps non-high grade and if there was a scenario perhaps enough premium of a return to perhaps make you do a bit more on the non-high grade side. Thanks. Sumit Roy : Hi, Haendel. Yes. This is a narrative that continues to be out there that we are not focused or that we are disproportionately focused on the high grade side of the equation. Just look at what we did this quarter. I mean, 62% of what we did was sub-investment grade or non-rated. So it is \u2013 I don't believe true to say that all we focus on is investment grade credit and that particular product. What we have tried to share with the market clearly unsuccessfully. So that we focus on risk adjusted returns that are points in time where the risk adjusted returns on investment grade credit is far superior to what we were seeing on the non-investment grade side. And we pivot there and we try to do those transactions. And then there are other times where the exact opposite is true, where sub-investment grade is allowing you to capture risk adjusted returns that are far superior. And so we find ourselves in that period today, where we are finding very good opportunities on the non-investment grade side of the equation, and as such are being able to get a lot of those transactions over the finish line, i.e., 62% in the second quarter. So we are indifferent to the credit ratings. What we focus on is looking at the totality of that particular opportunity to then ascribe a return profile that makes sense for the risk that we are undertaking. And that will continue to vary. We don't target investment grade. Investment grade tends to be a byproduct of the underwriting. So hopefully that clarifies the question you asked. Haendel St. Juste: Sure, sure. Certainly appreciate the color, the perspective. Any update with Encore still on track to close I believe in fourth quarter, how's the regulatory and licensing coming along. Sumit Roy : Still on track, we are quite optimistic. We've continued to stay very close to the MGC. We are working very closely with them, so we are very optimistic that it'll close by the end of this year in the fourth quarter. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Christie Kelly : Hey, Brad. Brad Heffern : Hey, everyone. Hi, Christie. One for you, I guess. On the new guidance, can you just talk about the moving pieces that kept the AFFO per share number unchanged despite the higher acquisition total? I assume it said potentially tighter spreads versus the cost of capital, but I'm curious if there was a FX impact or a interest expense impact or anything else. Christie Kelly : Yes. I think, Brad, just to start off Sumit \u2013 Sumit had started to touch on this in terms of some of the moving pieces given the fact that we had increase our acquisition volume to over $6 billion, but kept as you observed in our AFFO per share guidance the same and reaffirmed it. And there are some factors there in terms of first, the volatility in the capital markets as we've discussed, the overall rate hikes and the magnitude of those hikes and any future actions that may be taken. Both in terms of the European and U.S. environments. We also to the point that you were making. We do actually hedge from the perspective of FX to protect our international income as well as we\u2019ve got hedges in place to lower our effective interest rates, and we\u2019ll touch on that a bit more in a second. But the other thing too is that just the general timing of the investment volume, the team has just been doing a great job. We\u2019ve got really strong momentum as Sumit discussed in the market. And the acquisitions that we close from now towards the end of the year, while our attractive are really going to be setting us up nicely for 2023. So the timing of that isn\u2019t as beneficial for the year in AFFO as it will be for the full year impact next year. And I think, to the upside, we still have some clients on cash accounting, that have just started under their deferral arrangements. And so we\u2019ll be monitoring them for continued consistent payment performance, and make the appropriate calls and alignment with our policy and guidelines when we may be taking them off of cash accounting. But I\u2019d love to turn it over to Jonathan to talk a little bit more specifically about hedging and the impact. Jonathan Pong : Thanks, Christie. Yes, Brad, you\u2019ve seen us obviously issue a lot of local currency debt in the sterling market that\u2019s intentional, obviously, much lower haul in rates there. But certainly, from a natural hedge perspective, having interest expense denominated in the same currency where we\u2019re now getting rent limits the exposure that we have in volatility. And then we have a cleanup methodology where we hedge a portion of AFFO that is unhedged. And so from that dynamic, we feel like we\u2019ve mitigated the range of outcomes, upside and downside, but there is still some unhedged exposure, about 60% of our foreign-denominated AFFO is unhedged. So for every 10% move in the dollar, for instance, you\u2019re looking at maybe $0.015 of volatility on an annualized basis. So, we\u2019re not completely hedged, which can lead to upside if we see some mean reversion here in the dollar. But just a little bit of conservatism that we\u2019re taking here sitting here in August. Brad Heffern : Okay. I appreciate all the color. And then, Sumit, some of your peers this quarter have talked about portfolios trading at a discount to single assets. Is that something that you\u2019ve seen? And are you interested potentially in pursuing more portfolio deals? Sumit Roy : No more than in the past, Brad. Portfolio deals generally do tend to trade at a discount, especially in times like this when the cost of capital have gone up. And a lot of these potential buyers of big portfolios are sort of sitting on the sidelines. So this is essentially reverted back to where it was, where we would get a discount on portfolio transactions. And so if you look at our volume today, about 62% of what we did were portfolio transactions. So that actually accrues to our benefit, Brad, and we are certainly seeing exactly the same scenario as some of our peers have commented. Brad Heffern : Okay, thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Hi, everyone. Christie Kelly : Hi, Wes. Wes Golladay : Hey there. I got a question also maybe on the FX, more so on the future hedging, I guess. As you buy more properties overseas, would you do more, I guess, CP issuance tip for the hedging? And could we see the U.S. issuance of CP maybe go down to zero and unusual full capacity overseas? Jonathan Pong : Hey, Wes, it\u2019s Jonathan. I\u2019ll take that one. You may have seen our euro commercial paper program establishment recently, $1.5 billion equivalent together with the upsizing of our U.S. dollar commercial paper program. Focusing on the Euro CP side, we absolutely intend to utilize that to the extent that we have a use of euro currency. But right now, obviously, interest rates are much lower comparatively. We could probably issue one year year-old CP [ph] in a 25 basis point context and that compares to revolver borrowings that are 75 basis points or so. So certainly, having a liability and a very cheap liability at that denominated in euros will be additive on all fronts, limiting the amount of derivatives that we have to engage with to hedge our exposure and lowering the old interest rate that we have to pay on your borrowings. Wes Golladay : Got it. And then want to go back to the comment, sorry, go ahead. Sumit Roy : Yes, Wes, having said all of that, we will be leaning towards permanently financing our acquisitions as soon as possible. I mean this is really a mechanism for us to provide the surety to the market and take advantage of our A-/A3 rating. But this will continue to not dominate our overall debt profile. If you look at what our outstandings are today, it\u2019s about 7%. And that is how you should think about us running up business going forward. Wes Golladay : Got it. Then I want to go back to that comment about why do you need cap rates. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any difference between sale leasebacks, marketed assets, developer takeouts, any of your channels that you look at? Sumit Roy : Yes. It\u2019s not a function of the channel. I would say, Wes, it is much more a function of the overall market. If you are starting to see cap rates move in portfolio transactions, whether the portfolio comes from another seller or from a sale-leaseback avenue it\u2019s going to be reflective of markets. Does relationship play a hand? Sure, it does. But those are 5 basis points to 10 basis points to maybe 15 basis points at best. But it is really the market that dictates what those cap rates are going to be, not so much the channels. Wes Golladay : Great, thanks a lot. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Christie Kelly : Hi, Josh. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey Christie, hey, guys. So now that you\u2019ve kind of completed the integration of the VEREIT merger, what \u2013 how are you guys thinking about additional M&A? Sumit Roy : Josh, we won\u2019t let us breathe, will you? Joshua Dennerlein : You guys go to work hard. I mean, especially Jonathan, he got to work extra hard. Sumit Roy : That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. Josh, we\u2019ve always said that, look, as far as M&A is concerned, we are always open for opportunities. But it is not easy to facilitate an M&A trade. You need willing partners, you need the market environment to be conducive, you need to be able to look at the other portfolio to figure out, is there a massive amount of overlap in terms of strategically what we would have gone after had this entire portfolio been available. You then have to take into consideration social issues. There are so many things that sort of have to align before you can help facilitate an M&A trade. But having said all of that, and this is very consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past, we are always looking. And if the right opportunity presents itself, we\u2019re not going to shy away from it. So, we\u2019ve shown that we can do it. We\u2019ve done it a couple of times now. And we\u2019ll keep looking and keep working hard, like you said, Josh. Joshua Dennerlein : And then I think you mentioned grocery anchors. It sounds like the cap rates moved like 100 basis points higher. Were there any other asset classes or property types where you\u2019re seeing that kind of magnitude of a move? Sumit Roy : Yes. The industrial, I would say, not across the board, but some industrial, the movement has been quite pronounced as well, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 100 basis points, but it wouldn\u2019t be far to say, 50 basis points to 75 basis points. I just felt like the grocery market decelerated, i.e. the compression of the cap rates was so immediate from where we used to buy grocery here in the U.S., in the high-5s, this was the best-in-class grocery it accelerated down to the low-4s. And this was absolutely a testament to the amount of capital that had come into our space and the cost of debt available that allow these buyers to essentially hit the yield that they required on a cash-on-cash basis. And the unwinding was as quick, partially driven by what the Fed chose to do, partially driven by how that translated into the debt market. And then the withdrawal of some of this capital that relied on the debt markets. So, I think that phenomena is very unique to that particular sector of retail. And we didn\u2019t see that compression in any other sector that I can think of. Joshua Dennerlein : Interesting. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just a couple of quick ones staying on, maybe not.. Christie Kelly : Hey, Ronald. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, how are you? Just staying on the theme of large acquisitions, maybe M&A, but just even just bigger portfolio deals. I remember one of the benefits of sort of having a larger platform is being able to do these larger sale leasebacks, just any update on how that pipeline is building. And when can we see sort of more of those deals come through? Sumit Roy : Yeah, Ron I'll tell you the pipelines is big. And we are in discussions on fairly sizable opportunities. Again, similar to my comments with regards to M&A, I think it's difficult, sellers are still a bit anchored on the past in terms of where the market was literally five to six months ago, and their willingness to sort of recognize the current state of affairs is what's going to dictate as to whether these conversations and these pipeline opportunities translate to under contract opportunities. But I can tell you, Ron, that our pipeline has never looked stronger and a lot of that makeup is from bigger portfolio transactions. And so we are hopeful that a few of these will get over the finish line, and if it does, you'll be the first to know. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And if I could just ask one quick one on the guidance, just what's the assumption for \u2013 and sorry if you covered this already, what's the assumption for bad debt and that change at all, because it seems like that's been pretty low? Sumit Roy : Yeah. Jonathan or Christie should take that. Christie Kelly : Yeah. In terms of we're on a bad debt. Yeah. There was no specific change as it relates to bad debt. And in terms of the impact, for example, we've talked a lot about the clients that we still have on cash accounting and the fact that the deferral arrangements for a good approximately handful of those that were primarily impacted during COVID in the theater and health and fitness space. Their deferral arrangements started in July. And so we will be looking at their continued strong collections performance and make the appropriate calls in relation to our policies and things as we continue through this year and determine if we will be taking any of those clients off of cash accounting. And some of that impact Ron, is also one of the variables that we factored in as it relates to the upper end of our guidance. Ronald Kamdem : Thank you. Jonathan Pong : Ron, I'll just add, in terms of the remainder of the year guidance we're really looking at more of a normalized assumption. So, the first half of the year we've actually benefited from some paybacks on deferral agreements that have actually resulted in flat or even negative bad debt expense. So a little bit of conservatism in back half of the year, just given the macro environment and uncertainties. But definitely assuming just a normalized run rate in a pre-pandemic year. Ronald Kamdem : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. John Massocca : Good afternoon. Christie Kelly : Hi John. John Massocca : How's it going? So as we think about the competitive environment you face in the Europe versus the U.S., I mean, how sensitive are your European competitors to rising rates? And I guess if we can see continued upper pressure on UK and EU rates, could it push certain competitors out of the market kind of similar to what you've seen in the U.S. year-to-date? Sumit Roy : Absolutely. not trying to be flipping to John, but that is exactly what we expect to see happen. I think I mentioned that the BFA has just raised their interest rates by 50 basis points to 1.75%[ph]. We should start to see the cap rates adjust, but a lot of the levered buyers and those happen to be quite a few there. We will start to fall by the wayside. We've already seen that on a few transactions that we've been pursuing in the international markets. And again, this certainty of close is what gets amplified at times like this. And we've had transactions that literally have come back to us in the international markets, because they recognize our ability to close on especially large transactions. And so I expect, what we are seeing happen here in the U.S., a similar storyline to play out in the international markets and given that the level of competition that we face there, John is actually a lot less. We expect those advantages to be even more enhanced in quarters to come. John Massocca : And I guess maybe if we think back to kind of 3Q and 4Q of last year, I mean, how important was the non-public levered buyer in the European markets versus the U.S.? Is it kind of a bigger portion of the competitive set or is it equal less? Sumit Roy : Yeah, that's very difficult to quantify, but if I had to guess, I would say that there are more of the buyers in Europe that rely on the debt markets. And what makes it challenging is that the debt markets are potentially not quite as mature as we have here in the U.S., the circa few fewer people that we were competing with for the kind of product that we've been pursuing. And this is consistent with one of our strategic reasons to expand into Europe is the lack of similar kinds of competition that we see here in the U.S. and more of an amplification of our inherent advantages in that particular market. And we are certainly starting to see that more so recently. John Massocca : Okay. And I know it's a relatively recent phenomenon, but as you think about tenant credit, both with acquisitions and the in-place portfolio, how are you thinking about sellers of kind of hard goods versus more services-oriented tenants, given some of the recent shifts in consumer demand? Sumit Roy : Yeah, it does depend on the type of hard goods. I will tell you, Walmart just came out with another announcement today. They're getting pressured. But do I see Walmart struggling to pay their rent? I don't. Do I see now, if you were to look at categories, do I see apparel companies suffering a little bit more, especially if discretionary income continues to get pressured? Absolutely. Do I see quick service restaurants suffering the same? I don't. We saw this play out in the great financial crisis where some of the service oriented businesses actually thrived. The movie theater business did very well. The health and fitness business did quite well because, especially the lower cost health and fitness concepts, because they tend to attract the more value sensitive consumer base at times where alternatives have become a lot more expensive. I do expect, casual dining to feel a little bit more of the pressure. But again, the concepts are important who the operator is important, their balance sheet strength, their ability to take lessons learned from the pandemic where there were a lot more click and collects and deliveries that they were able to pivot to in terms of their business model. Those I think will hold them in good stead for the ones that survived and were able to institute those types of changes to their business model. But it's very much specific to the particular vertical and the environment we find ourselves in. John Massocca : Very helpful color. That's it for me. Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Thanks, John. Operator : The next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please go ahead. Christie Kelly : Hi there, Chris. Chris Lucas : Good afternoon. Hi, Christy. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a follow-up question on the commercial paper program. I guess, I'm just thinking about it so you've got $1.5 billion denominated in \u20ac1.5 billion denominated. Was there a specific reason why euro denominated rather than pound denominated related to efficiency, depth of market future uses? Just trying to understand why euro and not pound? Christie Kelly : Sure. Chris. Jonathan Pong : Hey Chris, it's Jonathan, you know, there's a nuance in the commercial paper market. The storage market is really not that big. So you don't really see a lot of stand-alone sterling programs. The Eurocommercial paper program does give us the flexibility to issue in sterling. And so to the extent there is demand in that market, we'll be able to tap into it. But by and large, this market is dominated by dollars and euros. Chris Lucas : Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then Sumit, just kind of taking a step back, sort of talk a little bit around the foreign exchange issue that's occurred this year. You've seen a pretty meaningful move in both in terms of the dollar appreciation relative to the euro and the pound. And if you kind of look historically back at this other than really like a week during COVID in March of 2020, you have to go all the way back to the Reagan [ph] Administration decline sort of this relative value on both the pound and on the, on the euro impact that far, but in terms of the dollar strength. So my question is, does that impact at all your view about where to allocate capital at this point? Or are you completely agnostic to the exchange rate? Sumit Roy : It would be unfair to say, Chris, that we are agnostic to the exchange rate. Obviously, this is something that we have an acute focus on \u2013 like we said, we are not 100% hedged. That wouldn't be economically prudent to do so. We are about 40% hedged on our income stream. And we have instituted strategies to sort of mitigate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Having said all of that, we did exactly the same analysis, Chris, to figure out at which point in time where these exchange rates at current levels and concluded the same that look, again, I might look foolish in three months from now. But this looks like the low point in terms of foreign exchange between the GBP and the U.S. and the euro in the U.S. And you're starting to see with increases in interest rates by the Bank of England, similar to the ECB, you're starting to see that correct itself and start to revert a little bit more to the mean. So that could potentially act as a tailwind. But not knowing and not trying to take a forecast on where these things are going to play out. That's the reason \u2013 one of the main reasons why we kept our range exactly the same, but we believe that we are very well situated currently. Ultimately, this is a long game. And what we want is to let the product and the acquisition opportunities dictate with is with an eye on the exchange rate, dictate how we build out our portfolio. So totally not fair to say we would be agnostic, but it is something we keep in mind, but doesn't necessarily drive our strategy in its entirety. Chris Lucas : Great. That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s all I have this afternoon. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Chris. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Chris. Operator : The next question is from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street. Please go ahead. Christie Kelly : Hi, Harsh. Harsh Hemnani : Hey, Christie. A quick one for me. When you think about the investments in Europe, what percentage of them are sale-leaseback originations versus acquisitions of existing leases? And how does that compare to your investments in the U.S.? Sumit Roy : I don't think that there is a major difference between the compositions. If you look at what we did on the sale leaseback side, Harsh, it was right around 28% year-to-date. And we've had quarters where it's been as high as 75% and we've had quarters where it's been as low as 20%. And so it really is a function of what's available, when is it closing in a given quarter, et cetera, that dictates the sale-leaseback piece. Having said that, I think when we do decide to pursue sale leasebacks in a meaningful way. It is possible that some of those transactions would be much larger in size. For instance, if you think about our inaugural transaction that we did when we first went into the U.K., it was a sale-leaseback that we did with Sainsbury's. That was $0.5 billion. If you think about the gaming industry and the sale leaseback we've done with them, it's going to dominate that particular quarter because it's a $1.7 billion transaction. And we see similar types of opportunities where when and if those close in a given quarter, it's going to dominate that particular quarter. And I don't think it's unique just to the U.S. I think it will be consistent between the U.S. and the international markets. Harsh Hemnani : Okay, thank you. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi. Christie Kelly : Hi, Linda. Linda Tsai : Hi Christie. In terms of the 2% growth in same-store revenue, I saw health and fitness and restaurants and materially theaters contributed to the positive change in second quarter same-store. When did the strong comps start to normalize? And is that partly dependent on cash basis payback? Sumit Roy : It is. It's when we start to sort of take a lot of these clients off of the cash basis and get them back on accrual basis. You're still going to have a period of about 12 months where there's going to be this mismatch. And some of these higher, same-store rental growth that you're seeing is essentially a byproduct of moving some of these cash accounts back to accrual account. And once all of this normalizes, you should expect us to be back in that 1% to 1.5% same-store growth. But right now, it's a period where we are now starting to recognize and move some of these clients and case in point AMC back to accrual accounting, and that's disproportionately impacting the growth rate in a very favorable way. Linda Tsai : That's helpful. And then I think previously, you talked about putting some money into vacant properties to redevelop to help releasing prospects. Is this something you're still pursuing? Sumit Roy : Very much so, Linda. And I think that is being captured in some of our re-leasing spreads that we've \u2013 that I'm so proud of the asset management team, over 105% essentially net with zero TI dollars. A lot of that \u2013 not a lot, but some of it is certainly driven by our repositioning. One of the highest recapture percentages that we had was taking a quick service concept and converting it into an alternative retail concept largely driven by a predictive analytics tool, saying that the best and use for this particular location is not a quick service restaurant, but this alternative concept. And we went down that path and we're able to recognize north of 200% in terms of recapture rates. And we share all of that information in aggregation with you on our supplemental so you can track some of that. But that is absolutely very much a focus of ours, Linda, and we hope that, that will continue to be \u2013 become a bigger and bigger portion of the value driver of our growth going forward. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today. I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the summer, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, that this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Andrea Behr, Corporate Communications Manager. Please go ahead. Andrea Behr : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Andrea. Welcome everyone. At Realty Income, we pride ourselves in having a consistent and dependable business model. For 53 years as an operating company, we have persevered through a variety of macroeconomic climates and our track record of stability notably during periods of volatility is particularly relevant during current times. We sit here today well positioned and operating very well across all areas of our business. We are grateful for all of our team members who make the success possible. To start off, we capitalized on opportunities to bolster our balance sheet in the third quarter, including raising over $2 billion of equity on the ATM with approximately $700 million of proceeds received during the third quarter as well as over $1.3 billion remaining subject to our settlement on a forward basis in alignment with our capital strategy. In addition, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in October to further increase our liquidity. Between cash and cash equivalents, our availability under our credit facility, our liquidity as of the end of the third quarter was over $2.5 billion, which when combined with the $1.3 billion of our unsettled forward equity and approximately $744 million in net bond proceeds equates to liquidity of approximately $4.6 billion had the forwards and net bond proceeds being received at quarter end. Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we acquired approximately $1.9 billion in high-quality real estate, bringing us to approximately $5.1 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. A significant portion of the properties purchased in Q3 were part of portfolio deals or large transactions. We believe these deals were accessible to us because of our size, scale, relationships, ability to close, access to and cost of capital together with our research and technology-driven analytic capabilities. For Realty Income, our competitive advantages allow us to design and execute on strategies that benefit all those we serve including our clients. The pending $1.7 billion Encore Boston Harbor transaction, which we continue to expect to close this year remains an example of this dynamic. Based on our current total portfolio annualized base rent, the transaction would comprise approximately 3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent, once closed. Further leveraging our international capabilities, we made our advent into Italy last week investing approximately \u20ac165 million in seven high-performing wholesale clubs, operated by Metro AG in major Italian cities like Rome and Florence. Metro is a pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry and operates almost 700 stores across Europe. Metro is publicly listed and investment-grade rated, and has continued to perform well during and since the pandemic. We are delighted to add them as a client and hope we will be able to add to this initial portfolio over time. During the third quarter, we did experience cap rate expansion registering a 6.1% cash cap rate on investments, which compares favorably to the 5.7% cap rate we realized our investments in the second quarter. This resulted in a third quarter investment spread, of 165 basis points based on actual capital raised, which is higher than our year-to-date total of 161 basis points and above our historical average. As we move towards year-end, we continue to see cap rates push higher as capital costs increase. This is consistent with the historical correlation we've come to expect, which has tended to preserve investment spreads as the market adjusts. Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $18 billion this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume approximately $78 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 6.5% of sourced volume year-to-date. The international market continues to be an important part of our strategy and it remains an active component of our volume, representing approximately 33% of investment volume in the third quarter. Capital recycling continues to be a strong component of our funding strategy, which also has the dual purpose of culling noncore properties from the portfolio. During the third quarter, we sold 34 properties generating net sale proceeds of $142 million, at an unlevered IRR of 12.8% illustrating the full cycle attractiveness of owning net lease real estate under long-term leases.  We intend to continue to act opportunistically to dispose of assets at moments in time when we can obtain attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to the disposition of properties on our balance sheet, we also sold our interest in seven properties owned in an industrial JV that we assumed as part of our VEREIT merger. The gross purchase price totaled $905 million, at a low 4% cap rate. Our share of net sale proceeds was approximately $113.5 million. Our core portfolio continues to perform and by and large our clients have generally continued to perform very well despite the cyclical market changes and shifts in consumer behavior. A point to note, as previously publicly announced one of our clients Cineworld commenced Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September. Despite being one of its largest landlords, Cineworld represented only 1.5% of our total portfolio annualized base rent as of Q3. We'll continue working closely with Cineworld, as this process continues towards resolution. For some color regarding theaters, for the third quarter 2022, we collected approximately 85% of the contractual rent across our theater portfolio, as Cineworld Group plc was not yet required to pay rent for the month of September. For the month of October 2022, we have collected 100% of the contractual rent across our theater clients including Cineworld. For some specifics, our Cineworld portfolio consists of 41 properties, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Through September, we have recognized $23.5 million of cumulative reserves on these properties, representing primarily contractual rent and expense recoveries that have not been collected, dating back to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These 22 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $1.6 million of monthly contractual base rent or 40% of our total exposure to Cineworld. Based on current public information and our internal analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets are generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio. Our locations are freestanding, single-tenant assets, typically with large land areas and close proximity to population centers, supporting potential conversion to residential, industrial or life science uses. We have received reverse inquiries from multifamily and industrial developers exploring opportunities on these sites. We believe there is alternative and adaptive reuse potential if Regal were to vacate any locations as part of bankruptcy. Moving on to some of the most important key operational metrics, delivering value that continue to demonstrate a consistent well-positioned real estate portfolio. At the end of the third quarter our occupancy was 98.9%. In Q3, we released 169 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 108.5%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 106.7%. As we look forward, less than 4% of our contractual base rent comes due through the end of 2023, providing strong visibility into our near-term portfolio performance. At quarter end, approximately 43% of our portfolio's total annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Our properties leased to clients in our portfolio watch list represented less than 4% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent. Lastly, our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date and we continue to expect full year same-store growth to be approximately 2%. At this time I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. Put simply, it was another productive quarter for us. In the third quarter our business generated $0.98 per share of AFFO, representing 7.7% year-over-year growth. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR was 5.3 times or 5.2 times giving effect to the annualization of net investment activity during the quarter. These ratios do not reflect the $1.3 billion in outstanding equity forwards we had at quarter end. As Sumit previously mentioned, we were both active and prudent in our capital-raising efforts since the end of the second quarter. In addition to raising over $2 billion during the quarter at an initial weighted average price of approximately $68 per share, subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $750 million bond transaction, the majority of which served as a synthetic euro offering to take advantage of favorable foreign exchange dynamics, while also allowing us to return to the US dollar public fixed income market, which we last accessed in 2020. In conjunction with this offering, we executed a US$600 million to euro 10-year cross-currency swap, resulting in the receipt of approximately $612 million in euro proceeds, an effective fixed rate euro-denominated semiannual yield to maturity of 4.7%. Additionally, giving effect to $500 million of interest rate hedges, which were terminated with the operated, we generated a $72 million cash settlement gain at pricing, which when amortized over the 10-year tenure of the note is expected to result in an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 3.93%. Financial flexibility has long been a hallmark of our strategy and our ability to move between various financing markets given our international capital needs is a competitive advantage. As previously reported in the third quarter, we upsized our US commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established a euro commercial paper program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our multicurrency $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, gives us the flexibility to efficiently match fund our short-term funding needs in various currencies at much lower rates than comparable US facility borrowings. As we look forward, we have limited near-term refinancing risk as only $23 million of mortgage debt comes due through the end of 2023 and our next unsecured debt maturity is not until 2024. With continued stable and consistent results in the quarter, we tightened our AFFO guidance range by $0.06 to $3.87 to $3.94, maintaining the midpoint at a 9% year-over-year growth rate, consistent with what we initially provided a year ago. As the monthly dividend company Realty Income's dividend will remain sacrosanct to our mission. This is a testament to our confidence in the time-tested consistency of our business model, supported by a conservative balance sheet and diverse real estate portfolio leased to clients that are leaders in their respective industries. In September, we increased the dividend for the 117th time and for the 100th consecutive quarter, representing a 5.1% increase compared to the dividend declared one year ago. We are proud of these accomplishments and the work our talented colleagues perform every day to help drive this consistent track record. Earlier this week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our VEREIT merger. We've grown together as one team over the last year and I'm pleased that we remain on track to realize over $50 million in run rate annual cost synergies that we estimated when we announced the merger. And with that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you Christie. Our strengths have been accentuated in this quarter's result. While we cannot control the macroeconomic forces that periodically introduce volatility in the capital markets, I am regularly reminded that the resiliency of this team and the inherent stability of our business model allows us to look to the future with confidence. I'm pleased that we are able to lean in to market conditions when it's advantageous to serve our shareholders, and I believe that the best is still ahead of us. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Now we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Brad Heffern, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern : Hey, good morning out there, everyone. Cap rates on acquisitions were up 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Looks like some of that's related to the mix of industrial and investment grade, but can you talk about how much of that was underlying market cap rates moving? And was there a particular goal to pursue higher cap rates to preserve accretion? Sumit Roy : It's more the former than the latter. We are definitely seeing movement in cap rates. If we were to compare it to what -- where the environment was at the beginning of the year, which is what I would say we saw over the last couple of years and compare it to cap rates that we are seeing today and what we experienced in the third quarter, I would say retail cap rates have moved circa 100 basis points. And it's a story of basically two ends of the credit spectrum. If you think about the high investment grade grocery assets those at the beginning of the year were trading in the low four cap rate range and those have moved the most. I would say today they are in the 5.5% maybe even in the 5.6% ZIP code. So that's about 150 basis points. And then on the other end of the spectrum, it was the higher yielding cap rates that had compressed quite a bit over the last few years that also saw similar movement. But the stuff that was in between has seen movements circa of 100 basis points and that's really what is starting to translate into actual realized cap rates that you noticed for the third quarter. Having said all of that, things don't happen at the spur of the moment. I mean, a lot of these transactions -- we started to have discussions with our potential clients about the movement that we were seeing in our cost of capital, which was quite brutal and quite immediate. And thanks to the relationships, thanks to our ability to close all of the things that I enumerated in my prepared remarks, some of the more institutional type clients were also experiencing similar dynamics and we're more than willing to adjust cap rates to continue to do business and continue to fund their respective businesses. And I think that's what you saw translating to the 40 basis points of increased cap rate that we were able to realize in the third quarter. But it is a timing thing. I just want to be very careful that depending on -- if for instance if the gaming asset in Boston, if that were to have closed in the third quarter that's already been sort of -- it's a transaction that's going to have a 5.9% cap rate that's going to sway the overall cap rate. So, it really is a question of when did those transactions get under contract and what is the timing of close that's going to dictate, what the quarter results are. But having said all of that, I think we are definitely seeing movement and it is in the quantum that I described earlier. It's a similar story on the industrial side. I would say, that industrial cap rates have also moved considerably and this is something that we started seeing even in the early part of the year. I think in my first quarter comments, I had talked about maybe seeing a 25 to 50 basis point movement. This was on the heels of Amazon announcing, that they are no longer going to be big takers of industrial assets. They accounted for about 20% of the volume, over the last few years. That started to see some movement -- that resulted in some movement on the industrial side. And then that movement continued through the second quarter. And I'll say today, despite what we quoted in our joint venture that we sold in the low 4s, I would say, similar assets that we were pursuing are in the 5.5 ZIP code today. So, there's clearly movement. And the hope is that the movement will continue in the right direction, over the next coming months. And our portfolio is a testament -- our portfolio, as well as our pipeline is a testament to that. Brad Heffern : Okay. Appreciate the detailed answer. Christie, I was hoping you could walk through the puts and takes on the new guide. Obviously, you had headwinds from FX and from higher rates. I'm curious, what the offsetting factors were they kept the midpoint the same. Thanks. Christie Kelly : I think Brad, you captured the headwinds together with the strengthening US dollar. I think in terms of where we see opportunity, is first as it relates to the determination on our AFFO per share, is the overall developments and as it relates to our clients that are on cash accounting. I just want to note that for Regal, we have no change associated with the status of Regal and in the midpoint of our guidance are expecting full collection. A couple of other things, is also just our access to the international borrowings, which are a nice tailwind and you can see that demonstrated in what we were able to do with the euro commercial paper program. And as Sumit articulated, our relationships with clients our ability to pivot in the marketplace, together with our strong pipeline and the timing of the Encore transaction, which could be a positive or a negative. Hope that helps, Brad. Brad Heffern : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from R.J. Milligan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. R.J. Milligan: Hi, good afternoon. I'll start with my boiler plate question for the quarter, and certainly appreciate the attractively priced capital, you guys were able to source in 3Q, but I'm curious how you view your current weighted average cost of capital and what kind of spreads you've been able to achieve here quarter-to-date. Sumit Roy : Yes. So, the spread we were able to achieve third quarter year-to-date was right around 161 basis points and this is based on actual capital raised throughout the year. And for the quarter, it was closer to 165 basis points. And one of the things I'll point to is that in our investor deck, I believe it's Page 26, we do lay out precisely how we calculate our cost of capital. And there are basically three components to it, one of which is the free cash flow that we are generating. -- as well as the cost of equity loaded for the cost of raising that equity and our bond prices. But there was a strange thing that played out in the third quarter, and I don't know if I've got this fact 100% right, but we reached a 52-week high as well as our 52-week low during the third quarter. That was the level of volatility that we experienced, and we will call it luck, call it Jonathan Pong doing his thing, -- we were able to raise a lot of our equity capital on a forward basis with an average price of $68, and that's $2 billion worth of equity 700 of which we obviously was able to -- we were able to close and settle at the end of the third quarter and $1.3 billion of which we will settle at the end of the fourth quarter. And so that's the reason why I want to be very precise around the actual realized spread versus what traditionally has been a calculation of average WACC over a given period. This is the first quarter where we felt like there was a massive diversion precisely driven by the volatility that I just spoke about. But yes, that's how we calculate our WACC. R.J. Milligan: That's helpful. And so given the fact that cap rates in general are starting to move higher, but probably not as quickly as the cost of debt. How are you thinking about acquisition volume as we move into 2023? Is it time to maybe tap the brakes, sort of keep the pace, or do you think there's going to be more opportunities to potentially even accelerate the pace? Sumit Roy : Yes. R.J., it's going to be a function of how quickly the cap rates adjust. Clearly, there are mechanisms available to us on the capital side on the financing side that we are going to avail of -- but that's limited in terms of what is the ultimate spread that we can realize. And we are being incredibly disciplined around making sure that the team is pivoting to hurdle rates that we need to achieve on the cap rate side in order to continue to maintain spreads that we feel like represents the right spread for the kind of risk that we are taking based on the acquisitions that we are pursuing. And I think I mentioned this in the second quarter, but I'll say it again, I have been pleasantly surprised with how quickly cap rates have moved. And again, based on some of the transactions that we are seeing in our pipeline, we are very optimistic that we'll be able to continue to maintain the spreads that we have historically maintained -- and we see that over the continuing next few quarters. But timing will be of the essence. Like I said, if there are certain transactions that we entered into, especially on the development side, that was 12 months ago, those are going to not be quite as accretive as transactions that we are entering into today, which will potentially close in the fourth quarter and some of which will close in the first quarter that have spreads that are more in line with what our historical spreads have been. So timing is going to be of the essence in terms of what we report at the end of a given quarter. R.J. Milligan: Make sense. Thank you for the color. Sumit Roy : Thank you, R.J. Operator : Thanks. Next question will be from Greg McGinniss, Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Hi. Good afternoon. Sumit, deal sourcing is still significant, but it's also slowed each quarter in 2022 even, while potentially casting a wider net internationally. What are the drivers of that trend? And do you expect it to continue that way into Q4 in 2023? And how might that declining investment opportunities impact acquisition levels and cap rates? Sumit Roy : Yes. It's a good question Greg. And it goes back to having sticky sellers. Sellers who haven't quite embraced the changing cost of capital environment, who are hoping for this to have a shorter duration disruption and starting to recognize that given what the Fed is doing, given what they're seeing on the inflation side that this may be a longer process than what they had anticipated. I think that is part of the reason why you saw a tailing off on the sourcing side. We were averaging around $30 billion per quarter. Third quarter I would still claim was quite robust with $18 billion worth of sourcing, one-third of which was from the international market. And so on a relative basis, yes, there was a bit of a slowing down and it's largely being driven by the time it takes for sellers to adjust to the new environment. And there too it really is a story of those that are institutional sellers they are able to adjust to it a lot quicker than some of the non-institutional more private owners of real estate for whom it has taken and will take a little bit more time to adjust. Greg McGinniss : Great. That's fair. Then just going back to the portfolio deals or transactions that you mentioned in your opening remarks. Can you provide a little more detail on the size of some of those deals asset types and whether that's maybe trend that you expect us to move into maybe that seller is just more willing to accept the current financing environment for what it is? Sumit Roy : Yes. I think, the way I'll answer that question is to say in large portfolio deals, which tend to be owned by institutional owners they're far more receptive to the changing cap rate environment and far more accepting of the changing cap rate environment. And so it will come as no surprise to you that over 70% of what we did were portfolio deals in the third quarter. It should also come as no surprise to you that some of the institutional owners of real estate were far more willing to enter into sale leaseback as an alternative source of raising capital, especially, given their traditional sources of capital which may have been the leverage finance market or the high-yield market and the disruption that they saw there. And so about 50% of what we did in the third quarter were largely -- were sale-leaseback transactions. And so I think that will give you a flavor for some of the transactions that we did. It was still mostly I want to say 94% was retail and there was about 4%, 4.5% of industrial assets that we did, but largely driven by what we are seeing on the retail side. Greg McGinniss : Great. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Next question will be from Michael Goldsmith UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. International acquisitions represent about 33% maybe lighter than what we've been seeing. The opportunity set just larger in the US now relative to Europe. Or are you seeing anything in Europe that you want to highlight in terms of pricing or sentiment and recognize that also comes at the time when you moved into Italy? Sumit Roy : I'll tell you Michael I mean we were doing north of 50% in the international markets in the first quarter. We did north of 50% in the second quarter. We are at one-third of the total volume in the third quarter. Again, it really is a function of the timing of close et cetera. Having said that, I will say that the sellers in the US are far more accepting of the changing financing environment than perhaps in Europe. And Europe is by country. It's a smaller market. And so it does take a little bit longer for things to adjust. Having said all of that, we are finding very good opportunities in the UK. And now with the advent into Italy I believe that momentum will continue. Because for precisely some of the reasons that I think we touched on during the second quarter, the debt markets are very unsettled. It has a very high cost associated with it. And that's driving some of the transactions actually on both sides of the pond. But one of the additional dynamics that we are seeing play out in Europe is some of the pressures that some of the funds are feeling. And in order for them to raise the appropriate level of capital, monetizing real estate is creating opportunities for us. And so I wouldn't read too much into it. There is still a very, very healthy pipeline that we have within Realty Income. And the sourcing volumes continue to be yes, lower than what we saw in the first half but still very healthy. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you, Sumit. And as a follow-up grocery is in your top 10 industries. Kroger is one of your top 10 clients. Does consolidation in the grocery industry give you any pause or change your opinion about kind of the future of this sector and as a product type within your portfolio? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Sure, Michael. Look I mean anytime you have consolidation the question needs to be asked who is doing the consolidation? If Kroger is going out there and this is a publicly announced transaction with regards to Albertsons, Kroger is still BBB rated. S&P reaffirmed the rating, although they did put it on a negative outlook. And they're acquiring Albertsons, which is a BB-rated credit still solid rated. But I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. Now there are obviously a lot of other social issues that we have to also address and take into consideration. But from a pure credit standpoint it's actually -- it's a stronger outcome for us that suddenly 30 basis points that we have of Albertsons that has a BB credit associated with it, is now going to get enhanced to a BBB rating. So from a purely a credit perspective, that's not necessarily a bad outcome for us, but that obviously doesn't address a lot of other issues that should be addressed. And I think is percolating through the markets today, around the viability of this combination. But by and large there isn't a standard answer that all consolidation is good. It really does depend on the specific situations. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have a question from Wes Golladay of Baird. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Hey everyone. Just a question on the hedging, a lot of the ForEx volatility and interest rate volatility is that making it easier or harder for you to hedge cost effectively? Jonathan Pong : Hey Wes, it's Jonathan. Look it's been a very volatile FX environment as we certainly saw in the third quarter. I wouldn't necessarily say that's been harder to hedge. I mean, these are all very liquid currencies that we're looking to hedge going out very short-term. And so from that dynamic, yes, it's difficult to understand where these rates might be going but the mechanism itself nothing has really changed. On the hedging front, I would say that when you look out the next 12 months we are around 50% hedged at this point on earnings. And we aspire to get to our hedging program where hopefully going forward rates aren't the story -- FX rates aren't the story of any quarterly earnings. So rest assured we're very mindful of that. Wes Golladay : Got it. And I want to touch upon Regal. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic under an adverse scenario for the cash basis tenets. So I guess question number one do you overall expect a positive outcome here? And then question -- part two of the question was for the master lease asset. That's -- and all are typically is how we view it. In your history is that typically the case where do these ever get negotiated for a modest haircut? I guess, what should we embrace for based on historical precedent? Sumit Roy : So Wes, there isn't one single answer that can address the master lease question. It is very much jurisdictionally dependent, depending on where the bankruptcy is playing out. And in this case, I think, I believe, it's in Texas. It's a function of how they're going to interpret the strength of the master lease. But yes, having a master lease certainly does accrue certain benefits to us. And it should be viewed as an all or nothing situation. But we can't guarantee that going forward. We'll see how it all plays out. With regards to Regal and the ultimate outcome, you read a fair amount of optimism into some of our prepared remarks and when we have answered questions directly. That is a true read. I'm not saying that, Regal will continue to run 41 assets when they emerge from Chapter 11 but what I am telling you is the ultimate economic outcome, on this portfolio, we feel very comfortable about. And a lot of it has largely been driven by unsolicited inbounds that we have been receiving, even on some of the assets that we recognized to be not very good performers and recognizing that the best use for these assets perhaps may not be a theater asset going forward but something totally different. And when you start to look at where these are located the amount of land in some cases north of 10 acres creating a mixed use or a multifamily makes it tremendous amounts. And value creation opportunities for us to partner with some of these developers can create a lot of value for us. Yes, it's going to take time, but we feel fairly optimistic that the ultimate economic outcome on this portfolio will be one that we will be very comfortable with. Wes Golladay : Got it. Thank you very much for that. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Next question will be from Ronald Kamdem, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. Just a couple of quick ones. Just back to sort of the tenant health. You sort of talked about Regal which was really good disclosure. But any sort of other tenants that are of material size whether it's 50 basis points, 100 basis points on the watch list that we should be thinking about? And how are you guys -- and can you just update us on what the reserve for bad debt is looking like so far year-to-date? Sumit Roy : Yes, I'll take the question around do we have more than 50 basis points -- 50 basis points for any other clients outside of Regal and the answer is no, we don't. Our total watch list is less than 4%. It's actually 3.9%. And we don't have any large clients on this watch list outside of Regal. Regal is the largest one. We do have some other clients on this in the health and fitness industry et cetera. But again from an overall perspective we feel pretty good about it. In terms of -- I'll have Christie answer the other part of your question. Christie Kelly : In terms of reserves Ron total reserves are $33 million. And just dovetailing with what Sumit said in regards to the watch list and what we've already made publicly available it's really primarily a story around Regal and the reserves that we have on the books associated with Regal. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And if I could sneak in -- my second one was just look if you take a step back and you think about sort of the company the balance sheet when the rest of the capital markets are sort of challenged it seems like this should be the environment where you guys can thrive and I think you sort of mentioned some of that in your opening comments. But I guess my question is just going back to sort of the acquisition volumes and the cap rate, just trying to get a sense of how much sort of pricing power, how much can you guys actually ask for higher cap rates right thinking could this be 25, 50, 75 basis points cap rate higher given that you do have such sort of advantaged cost of capital when others are looking for it? Sumit Roy : Ron I don't want to overstate the environment. You just need one other competitor to come in and undercut what the normal situation would dictate in terms of cap rates to continue to keep a lid on cap rates. Having said all of that, if you look at the trend lines, there is no doubt that cap rates are moving and they're moving much faster than -- and I've said this before -- than what I expected. It is also true that clients with whom we have relationships, we've been able to enter into contracts with them, where we've asked even from where we first started, and didn't have a contract to when they came back and reengaged with us and said, look, the cost of capital environment has changed for us. This is what we'll be able to do. They're still chosen to work with us, exclusively, and these tend to be larger transactions. So, there is no doubt that having fewer competitors out there, who have the cost of capital to be able to transact that spreads that would be acceptable to their investors, creates an opportunity for us. And this is a relative gain. We have been able to move cap rates, but I think it would be overstating, if I were to tell you that everything that happens going forward, we are going to be the beneficiary of. That's not the case. But we will do better than our share. I think that, Ron you can take away from what I'm saying. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Thanks so much. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street. Please go ahead. Harsh Hemnani : Thanks. Going back to the portfolio transactions piece, your peers have pointed out that there's a trade-off between acquisition volume in cap rates. You can always drive higher volume on cap rates in the fives. But it seems like because of the ability to drive larger portfolio deals you can drive both higher volumes than them at higher pricing. So, I guess, could you point out, how much of \u2013 how many basis points of pickup you can get on a portfolio transaction versus maybe a one-off single transaction deal? And how long you think, it will take for these higher cap rates to show up in the single transaction market? Sumit Roy : Yeah. Harsh, that's a very difficult question. But if you are forcing me to answer that question, I would say, anywhere in the region of 20 to 30 basis points, 35 basis points. And if that \u2013 if the transaction size continues to be bigger and bigger, you're going to start going beyond that is how you should think about it. There is a dearth in this particular environment of potential buyers being able to write large checks, and that is our single biggest advantage today, along with the fact that obviously on a relative basis our cost of capital has held up. But it is going to be very much asset-by-asset, portfolio-by-portfolio discussion in terms of what is that delta between the one-off market and the portfolio market. In terms of how long is it going to take, I'll tell you that, a Chick-fil-A \u2013 15 year Chick-fil-A will still trade in the force today. There is enough buyers \u2013 private buyers who can write a check for $5 million or $4 million who don't necessarily need to rely on the debt markets in order to do so. And so it's a tough question to answer in terms of how quickly the one-off market is going to adjust. There will be an adjustment, there's no doubt because even a lot of the private buyers would lean on the debt markets to finance some of their asset purchase. But it's tough for me to \u2013 I mean, I saw this Chick-fil-A example literally a week ago, and I asked the team what is the ask and what do you think it's going to trade at. And the answer was mid-4s. And so how long will it take for that to adjust? Who knows? The good news here is it helps us on the disposition side. And if we have one-off assets that we feel like we can take advantage of this market we'll certainly do so. It's not a big part of our business. But like I said more than 70% of what we buy are portfolio deals. And so there I think we are getting the kind of differential that it warrants. And so we continue to focus on that side of the business. Harsh Hemnani : Thanks. And then just considering the timing of moving into Italy, you mentioned that cap rates in Europe haven't reacted as much as those in the US, and it seems like the economic outlook might be slightly worse for Europe tenets as in the US. Given that backdrop what caused you to enter Italy today? And I guess, more importantly, what prompted the debt swap that was swapped into euros which suggests that maybe you're expanding more into Europe? Sumit Roy : Well, certainly part of that swap was to help finance, the transactions that we have in Europe including the one that we did with Metro. Look that's a fantastic transaction. We started having conversations around this transaction if I want to -- maybe at the beginning of this year perhaps even late last year. And it's a very interesting geography Italy is. It's the fourth largest GDP in Europe. It is one that we feel like, we can find these types of transactions with investment-grade rated or highly rated operators executing very good businesses, who are looking for real estate partners. And that's the reason why we find Italy to be very fascinating. And we haven't disclosed the cap rates. But suffice it to say it was a very healthy cap rate. And even in this environment is allowing us to capture spreads that are very acceptable to us. The point about Europe that I want you to take away is not so much that cap rates taking longer to adjust. It is adjusting. It will take longer. But to your point I think the pain in Europe is going to be a lot longer than the pain that we are planning on experiencing here in the US. And therefore it will create opportunities. And we want to be front in line to take advantage of those opportunities. And I think under Neil's tutelage, the team is very comfortable continuing to cultivate the relationships that they have established and -- in some of the areas that we would like to grow our business. That work is already being is already underway. And so this is going to continue to be a very important area of growth for our business. And I want to remind you Harsh, when you think about when we first went into the UK, this was in 2019, retail was not in favor. Brexit has dominated the conversation and we were able to do deals that subsequent to us having done those deals, cap rates compressed to the tune of 70 basis points 80 basis points perhaps even more. And so we are going to be opportunistic. We are going to position ourselves and use our inherent competitive advantages to execute transactions where it makes sense. But yes, we will be very diligent and very selective. But we didn't enter Europe to shy away when things got rough. We believe the exact opposite that, it's going to be at times like this and what we believe will happen in Europe over the next 12 months that will create opportunities for us. Harsh Hemnani : Great. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi. Thank you. Just a point of clarification. So in terms of the $31 million and the outstanding receivables from Regal, is that all factored into your reserve of $33 million? Christie Kelly : From the perspective of the reserves Linda, we took reserves on Regal as we had communicated of $23 million. And there, another $30 million of outstanding receivables associated with Regal to clarify. Linda Tsai : Okay. But then your -- the reserves you have right now, for just tenants on your watch list are $33 million? Christie Kelly : In terms of the total, we have for the watch list is $33 million, of which $23 million is Regal. And the remainder, as you would understand is primarily health and fitness. Linda Tsai : Okay. Thank you. And then just in terms of the recapture rate, that was very strong the 108%, could you just talk about what's driving this overall? It's been strong pretty much all year. Sumit Roy : Yes. Linda, I think it's a testament to the team. It's a testament to us controlling more assets for given operators. There is certainly, a drop of -- switching costs have gotten much higher for a lot of our clients. One of the things that we would compete with is the ability for our clients to basically say, I'm going to go and build the new asset down the road. And that's going to be a better outcome. But now, given the inflationary environment, given the construction costs, the switching cost hurdles have certainly crept up. And the fact that we do have 11,700 assets, we tend to control a lot more of the assets for a given client. And so, not talking about leverage, but we can have a much more holistic conversation with clients that not only take into account near-term resolutions but mid-term resolutions as well and come up with a win-win situation and therefore, be able to get the kind of re-leasing spreads that we have. Having said all of that, it is quite -- I'm very happy that we were able to do 108%, but it is -- I don\u2019t want to view it as an outlier. But if you look at the history of the company since we've been reporting this, we've basically been right around 100%, 101% net of re-leasing spreads. So this on a proportionate basis is certainly higher, and I think it's a testament to the environment we find ourselves. Linda Tsai : Do you think this continues for next year? Sumit Roy : I think near term, you can expect us to continue to be in this particular ZIP code. The one thing that I will say that we are looking into is, especially in an environment like this, we will be a little bit more receptive to looking at clients. And, look, this is an analysis that we do across the portfolio, what is the best economic outcome. Renewing with an existing client based on the 5% increase, engaging with an existing client that is asking for a 10% reduction from where it's closing and then looking at the alternative of selling the assets and putting the proceeds to use in the current cap rate environment. Once we go through that decision tree and let's also throw in repositioning of the asset as a fourth variable, we decide what is the most favorable outcome. And so far, the outcome that -- for the last few years has been resulting in north of 103%, 104%, 105% of re-leasing spreads, but it is possible that it might revert back to 100% or 101%, because it is more favorable for us to keep an existing client, while taking a bit of a haircut. But over the next six to eight months, I still believe that we'll be north of 100% in terms of recapture rate. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please, go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Sumit, you talked about the volatility, obviously, in your shares, but also really across the space. And so, at this point, there're some diverging multiples in cost of capital. So hoping to get your thoughts on M&A broadly within the sector and then your appetite for it. Sumit Roy : Yes. Nick, if you can point to candidates who'd be willing to engage in conversations around M&A today, this can be a very interesting time to discuss that. But I suspect that a lot of the management team, Nick, would be very focused on trying to run their business trying to make sure that they emerge from this particular economic environment stronger, so that they can engage in M&A transactions. But theoretically speaking, M&A is something that one should absolutely consider, especially if it's a 100% stock deal and you don't have an over-reliance on the public markets on the debt side to help finance. And if your relative cost of capital is stronger, which in our case, under most circumstances, it is, and that is something that would be very attractive to us. It's just -- it'll be difficult and I'm just -- it's a hypothetical comment I'm making. It'd be difficult to see management teams of potential companies wanting to engage in that sort of discussion in this environment. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And I completely understand that it takes two there, but that's helpful. And then just -- I know we've talked a lot on cap rates. You called out the casino deal that is still expected to close later this year. I think you mentioned a 5.9% cap rate that was struck earlier. Where would that be struck today do you think? How much cap rate expansion would you expect kind of on the casino cycle? Sumit Roy : Yes. You tell me, Nick. You cover all the gaming companies. And what I'm seeing is that, they've all gotten repriced. And I don't know if we did them the favor or what, but they're trading at levels that I don't know if there'll be a lot of movement from, where we entered into the win -- the Encore Boston Harbor asset. But, look, I still think that that is a wonderful asset. We underwrote it about a year ago now -- well, not quite, almost a year ago with a profile of about $210 million in EBITDA and it is already performing at a $250 million EBITDA and I still don't believe that it has fully stabilized, especially with gaming -- sports betting sorry being legalized. So I don't know if I would say to you Nick that that five nine would be dramatically different today, but we haven't seen an asset like that yet. So difficult for me to opine on that. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And where do you think it closes? Sumit Roy : We are hopeful and that's one of the things that we talked about on the earnings guidance. We are expecting to close in the fourth quarter. That remains our conviction. But really as to when in the fourth quarter remains a bit of a question mark, but we still believe that it will close in the fourth quarter. And I have a very high conviction on that front. Nick Joseph : Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from John Massocca, Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. John Massocca : Good afternoon. Sumit Roy : Hi, John. John Massocca : So just a quick one for me. It sounds like you were surprised by how kind of receptive cap rate environment has been to interest rate changes. Have you seen that kind of same receptiveness to maybe higher escalators particularly on retail transactions? Sumit Roy : Yes, we have. It's still difficult here in the US to get untethered or uncapped CPIs, especially given the environment that we are in and retail tends to be a low-margin business, but there is far more receptivity to getting higher interest rate -- higher -- what do... Christie Kelly : Escalators. Sumit Roy : Escalators. Thank you. Higher escalators in our leases today than it was perhaps 12 months ago. The same discussion on escalators in Europe, it is a lot more easier for us to engage and get CPI-type adjustments. And in fact, the Metro transaction that we talked about has CPI escalators built into the lease. And so I think those are easier in Europe than it is here, but we are starting to see the seller being more willing to give us higher escalators than what we have traditionally seen in this space. John Massocca : In terms of the fixed escalators on kind of US investments, particularly retail, any kind of brackets on how much they've increased maybe versus last year or even pre-pandemic? Sumit Roy : Yeah. John. Again, it's going to be a function of the type of retail. The higher-yielding stuff is going to tend to have higher elevation, higher escalators. The investment-grade guys -- it's still going to be tough. Maybe they'll be willing to give you fixed bumps every five years, which perhaps they wouldn't have 12 months ago. But I mean it's difficult for me to quantify the exact amount of increase in this environment. What I can tell you is we are seeing increases. John Massocca : Understandable. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much. Sumit Roy : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question will be from Chris Lucas, Capital One Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Lucas : Sorry for the long call. Just two quick ones for me, Sumit you talked a little bit about or actually frequently about the Encore transaction. The question I have is just, are you just waiting for regulatory approval? And once that occurs, you can close immediately, or is there some other timing issue related to the close? Sumit Roy : That is it Chris. It really is waiting on the regulators to give us a thumbs up. And once we have that, then we'll be in a position to close. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then Christie just a quick one for me. The -- I guess the other adjustments was about $0.04 a share, which is huge. Not a lot of detail there. Can you give me some color as to what that breakdown was, I know foreign exchange is a big one. I just don't know how much of it is? Christie Kelly : Yeah. The other adjustments was really related on the income statement to non-cash oriented translation loss of about $20 million. Chris Lucas : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Christie Kelly : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sumit Roy for closing remarks. Please go ahead. End of Q&A: Sumit Roy : Thanks Nick. Thank you all for joining us today. We're looking forward to ending 2022 strong and in seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in two weeks. Good evening. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Fourth quarter 2022 Operating Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager of Investor Relations at Realty Income. Please go ahead. Julie Hasselwander : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance.  During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Julie. Welcome, everyone. 2022 was a year of significant growth for our company. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the Realty Income team, who have worked tirelessly to execute on our strategic objectives and all of our investors for their support. The result of our team's collective efforts was reflected in our 2022 results, highlighted by AFFO per share growth of 9.2%, the highest annual growth rate for our company since 2013. Additionally, we closed on approximately $9 billion of high-quality investments in 2022, including $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, both the annual and fourth quarter investment volume set record highs for the company. Underpinning investment activity, transaction flow remains robust. We sourced $17 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing 2022 sourcing volume to $95 billion. Finally, we ended the year with occupancy of 99%, our highest occupancy rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. At Realty Income, we strive to provide stability and sustainable growth on behalf of our investors. And during periods of economic uncertainty like we find ourselves in today, the resilience demonstrated by our business model is important to highlight. During our 28-year history as a public company, our combined total return consisting of AFFO per share growth and dividend payments generated by our operations has not experienced a single year of downside volatility in the form of negative total returns. We believe we are in a very limited company among companies in the S&P 500 who can make that claim. This is a testament to the durability of our underlying cash flows, which is supported by a diversified portfolio of properties under long-term leases with clients that are leaders in their respective industries. We are constantly working to incubate new swim lanes for growth that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Since the start of 2022, we have expanded our [technical difficulty] new verticals to our platform. In October, we completed our debut transaction in Italy, acquiring seven wholesale clubs operated by Metro AG, an investment-grade pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry. As we discussed in 2019, when we purchased our first property internationally, we are intentional about consolidating the fragmented commercial real estate market in Europe and Italy represents the third country abroad in which we now have a presence. In December, we closed our $1.7 billion acquisition of Encore Boston Harbor resort and Casino from Wynn Resorts, which represent our first transaction in the gaming industry. The property is a good example of our strategy to partner with best-in-class operators to acquire high-quality real estate. It was purchased at a discount to estimated replacement cost, is subject to a long triple net lease of 30 years with attractive annual rent escalators and is located on prime real estate with structural barriers to competition. As anticipated in August 2022, Massachusetts partially legalized professional and collegiate sports wagering for the state, unlocking an estimated $850 million of gross annual gaming revenue and further supporting the strategic importance of this asset. In addition, we are pleased to announce a significant investment in what we are calling the consumer [technical difficulty] through the acquisition of a 224-property portfolio of dental practices during the fourth quarter. We expect this $520 million transaction to be just the start of additional investments we hope to make in a sector that we estimate has a total addressable market in the U.S. of nearly $1.8 trillion in real estate. We believe the consumer-centric medical industry shares many of the same attributes of the nondiscretionary service-based uses that make up much of our portfolio, and that have proven resilient throughout our company's long history. These locations offer essential goods and services in and around the major thoroughfares in which our assets are [technical difficulty] for properties leased to clients in the consumer-centric medical industry is extremely fragmented, which creates consolidation opportunities, we believe we are well suited to address. We believe this industry will continue to move towards a patient-centric model. The trend towards the outpatient model has been ongoing for decades, but we expect this shift to occur in an accelerated fashion post pandemic and will manifest in several ways that support our investment in the industry. First, the convenience of having care delivered closer to the patient will increase accessibility to the patient and reduce costs for all, including patients, payers and providers. Second, existing clients of ours like Walgreens and CVS will continue to disrupt the status quo as they gain an increasing share of primary care over time. And third, we believe these industry dynamics will help lower the per capita spend on health care in the U.S. and help improve the quality of outcomes. It is also important to note that the adjacency and fungibility of these assets are a strong fit with our existing footprint from a real estate standpoint. As we underwrote this industry, we conducted a study analyzing over 30,000 variables and found that our portfolio had a 90% similarity with a data set of assets in this industry and we look forward to increasing our exposure over time.  Moving on, as we announced earlier this week, actually yesterday, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Plenty, an emerging leader in vertical farms operations to support the development of Plenty's indoor vertical farms. As the initial transaction of the alliance, we will fund the development of an indoor vertical farm asset near Richmond, Virginia, located adjacent to an Amazon distribution facility. Plenty's highly automated farming architecture efficiently harnesses scarce natural resources to generate production yields that it believes are up to 350 times greater per acre than conventional farming. We regard Plenty as the forefront of a structural evolution in crop production and [technical difficulty] growth plans. In summary, these distinct new verticals are representative of the growth opportunities we expect to unlock over time to create value for our shareholders.  Moving on to our portfolio. In addition to our record occupancy at year-end, we are proud to have delivered a rent recapture rate of 103.8% during the fourth quarter on properties renewed or re-leased, bringing our full year recapture rate to 105.9%. We attribute these results to our proactive asset management efforts, the underlying quality of our real estate and our rent levels in the portfolio relative to market. Despite our recent accomplishments, we are still working through the impact of the pending bankruptcy on our Cineworld exposure, which is 1.4% of our total portfolio annualized base rent. As a reminder, -- we own 41 assets, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Following the announcement of the Cineworld bankruptcy in September 2022, we have collected 100% of contractual rent in each month from October 2022 through February 2023. As resolution on the bankruptcy has not yet materialized, we deemed it appropriate to revisit [Indiscernible] as we've had on our Cineworld receivables balance as we continue to evaluate the collectability of these amounts.  As a result of this analysis and in an abundance of caution, in the fourth quarter, we recorded $13.7 million of additional reserves associated with nine Cineworld properties previously on accrual accounting. In total, we now have $35.6 million of cumulative reserves on 31 properties that are on cash basis accounting, representing approximately 70% of our outstanding receivables from Cineworld. As a result of these changes, our unreserved receivable outstanding from Cineworld was $15.6 million at year-end, excluding straight-line rent receivables and including both deferred contractual rent and deferred expense recoveries. The 31 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $2.6 million of monthly contractual base rent. Based on public information and our proprietary analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio, and we will provide an update on the outcome of our negotiations when appropriate.  Finally, in January, we were pleased to welcome Greg White as Chief Operating Officer. The COO role has been vacant since 2018 when I assumed the role of CEO. And having known Greg for many years, I believe he has the experience, leadership qualities and business acumen to add immediate value to the management team.  Most recently, Greg served as a senior adviser in the Real Estate and Lodging Investment Banking group at UBS Securities. I admire Greg's extensive knowledge of the commercial estate space and his thoughtfulness and integrity will mesh well with our culture at Realty Income. I will now pass the call over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. Moving on to the balance sheet. As publicly disclosed, we've been quite active on the capital markets front. During the fourth quarter, we raised approximately $52 billion of equity proceeds primarily through our ATM program and when including equity sold in the first quarter of 2023, and we currently have approximately $850 million of unsettled forward equity available for future issuance. Throughout 2022, a we raised over $4.6 billion of gross equity proceeds at a weighted average price of $67.04, almost entirely through our ATM program. We ended the year with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA in our targeted range at 5.5 time or 5.3 time giving effect to the annualization. Please note that these ratios do not reflect the outstanding equity forwards I referenced previously. Our capital market activities in the fourth quarter and in January were aimed at striking the right balance between terming out our short-term borrowings while providing us the flexibility to participate and a lower rate environment over the next three years. In addition to the 10-year $750 million senior unsecured bond issuance we priced in October at an effective yield of 3.93%. In January, we executed a dual tranche $1.1 billion senior unsecured bond offering. The offering consisted of $500 million three year notes callable after one year and $600 million of seven-year notes. In conjunction with the three-year note, we capitalized on an attractive window to swap our interest payments from a fixed to variable rate structure, which we expect will replace a portion of our existing variable rate exposure in the capital stack. After giving effect to the interest rate swap, we effectively locked in a variable rate spread of negative 3.5 basis points to SOFR, which represents estimated savings compared to our credit facility of over 85 basis points. It is important to note that the $500 million of variable rate exposure is expected to be in lieu of variable rate borrowings we would otherwise have outstanding on our revolver or on our commercial paper program. Lastly, in January, we closed on a new $1 billion multicurrency unsecured term loan with an initial tenor of one year and with two 12-month extension options. In conjunction with closing of the term loan, we entered into a variable to fixed-rate swap resulting in an all-in effective yield of 5%. I would like to take a moment to say thank you to each of our lenders that participated. [technical difficulty] I would also like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and Steve Backe for their tireless efforts and leadership in delivering upon our capital market strategies. Moving on to guidance for 2023. We are initiating AFFO per share guidance of $3.93 to $4.03, representing 1.5% growth at the midpoint of the earnings range and including our current dividend yield, a total operating return profile of circa 6%.  So, the annualization of higher interest rates has moderated our expected growth rate for 2023, there is much to be optimistic about. The investment pipeline remains active. We continue to source investment opportunities across our target markets at accretive cap rates in the mid-6 to mid-7 range. As a result, we are introducing 2023 investment guidance of greater than $5 billion, and we will, of course, revisit this guidance each quarter as we gain incremental visibility to our transaction pipeline. Finally, as the monthly dividend company, an increasing monthly dividend remains central to our business model. We were pleased to have announced a dividend increase of 2.4% last week which represents a 3.2% growth rate over the year ago period. We remain proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having a dividend every year for over 25 consecutive years. With that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christie. In summary, our 2022 results demonstrated the capabilities of our platform and the competitive advantages afforded to us given our size, scale and access to capital. Over the long term, we believe stockholders will continue to benefit from the stability of our cash flows as we have proven with our track record of consistently positive total returns. Finally, we believe there is significant runway for further growth in untapped industries, geographies [technical difficulty] We look forward to unlocking these opportunities over time. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : I wanted to ask about the Plenty indoor farm deal. I guess this is a new industry for you guys as well as it seems like a relatively new industry in general. I guess how did you guys get comfortable with underwriting the risk and outlook for indoor farming? Sumit Roy : So, thanks for the question, Josh. Indoor farming, as part of the revolution that we are seeing in ag tech is something that we've been looking at for the better part of a year now. And specifically working with Plenty to try to understand their technology and how they're going to play in the ecosystem in terms of delivering crops in a much, much more efficient manner than traditional farming. If you look at ag tech and you look at vertical farming within this space, this is estimated to be a $50 billion industry over the next few years. And Plenty has a very established position within this particular vertical. If you look at some of the sponsorship that they have, it's with companies like Walgreens, Albertsons, and Driscoll\u2019s. These are some of the largest grocers and providers of end product to grocery stores. And Walmart has also invested directly in this company, along with [technical difficulty] from which they're going to be served the end product. So, they have a lot of institutional sponsorship. We've gotten to know the company very well. And at the end of the day, it's a $42 million investment, very well-located industrial location happens to be very adjacent to an Amazon box.  And we felt very comfortable based on the risk-adjusted return profile across various different scenarios that this was going to be a solid real estate investment. Having said all of that, one of the phrase that was used internally, the cherry on the top was the fact that this aligns with our value system as well, the value of giving more than we take. We genuinely believe that ag tech and vertical farming, specifically is going to have a big role to play in a world that continues to be resource constrained, yield constrained, water constrained and continued deficiency of arable land going forward.  So, for all of those reasons, we got very comfortable with Plenty as an operator, and more importantly, this particular vertical within ag tech as an industry to pursue. Joshua Dennerlein : And then could you maybe elaborate a little bit on like the returns and the outlays, I know it's a $1 billion pipeline. Like is that something you expect to kind of put out the door all this year over the next 2, 3 -- and are you guys financing the equipment inside the warehouse? Just trying to get more color on the deal. Sumit Roy : Sure. So, we are a real estate company, Josh, first and foremost. So that's all we are going to be investing in. Any equipment, all of the technology, et cetera, that is Plenty's responsibility. And so, none of the $42 million will go towards that. The $1 billion is a number that we hope to be able to invest with this name, which if we do would mean that this technology has become a success, and more importantly, this [technical difficulty] its position as one of the leaders in vertical farming. The investment itself has a much longer horizon, I would say, potentially the next five years. But keep in mind that any subsequent investment beyond the $42 million is on -- is at our option. And so obviously, we are going to approach this partnership from a purely real estate perspective. But a perspective that we do believe needs to partner with these types of technologies in order for these technologies to be successful. But ultimately, the real estate needs to work for us on a risk-adjusted return basis. And if that does, we are happy to help a company like Plenty continue to establish itself as a front runner in this space. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Great. Thank you. Sumit, can you expand a bit on the consumer medical vertical that you talked about in terms of what are the types of service offerings that are most interesting to you right now? What do those boxes look like, types of operators, so forth, yields, maybe? Sumit Roy : Yes. So, when we're talking about consumer-centric medical, we're talking about stuff that we are already currently exposed to and adding a few more areas around the edges. So, what are those areas? Like we are already exposed to drug stores, but drugstores of yesterday is not the drug store of tomorrow. What you've probably heard in the press both Walgreens and CVS are investing very heavily to continue to take share of the physician -- the general physician services. And this is an incredibly fragmented area of the business, and they are investing multibillion dollars in their health hub, minute clinics, et cetera, to [Indiscernible] be able to provide those services. And so that will continue to be an area, infusion centers, dialysis, eye care, dental care, pediatric care, behavioral facilities, urgent care, those are all concepts that have gained tremendous momentum, especially post pandemic, and will continue to gain momentum as a method of delivering health care to the end consumer. And the belief here is that the per capita health care cost that we in this country experience is essentially 2 times the average of what an OECD company -- country experiences. And how do we continue to bring that down? And factors like convenience, being closer to the consumer, making sure that there is a relationship that can be established. So, issues can be addressed on the front end rather than when it becomes an issue later on in life. I mean, today, if you look at the U.S. health care, only 30% of the population actually has a general physician that they can identify as their own. 70% don't have one, and this goes back to preventative care as being a precursor to reducing the cost of health care. And that is the business model that we have embraced that we believe will be -- in addition to the traditional ways of delivering health care will be a very important step in helping reduce cost. And so, anything that sort of lends - any concept that lends itself to this will be open season for us. And what we have then looked at it is to try to analyze the actual boxes that these types of facilities are housed in. And what we found was that there is a 90% -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, there's a 90% overlap with locations and boxes that we have in terms of size, in terms of [Indiscernible] et cetera. And there are a whole slew of variables that we looked at. And these assets that lend themselves to consumer-centric medical. And so, there are a lot of synergies. It is incredibly fragmented. It's a $1.8 trillion market today, expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2027. And it's all about increasing our total addressable market, using our core strength that we bring to the table to help consolidate the market and continue to sort of redefine what net lease investing is. And this is a perfect example  [Technical difficulty]  you had -- if you were saying something post the end of my answer, we missed all of that. So, you're back on. Anthony Paolone : Okay. Sorry about that. And then my second question relates to yields and thinking about just near term, like the first and second quarter, I think you mentioned mid-6s to mid-7s. You did 6.1 in the fourth quarter, but just -- does it -- should we expect that it moves into that range here in the near term? Or is that a number that you might get to over the course of the year? Just trying to think through what you're seeing on the ground today? Sumit Roy : Yes, Tony. We actually put out some numbers on January 9, we put out, I think, a pro sup when we were offering the unsecured bonds, where we shared the pipeline with you, and then the pipeline included transactions under contract and accepted LOIs. And that was circa $1.3 billion worth of transactions, a 7.1% cash cap rate. So clearly, what we are talking about in terms of finally the cap rates moving is now manifesting itself in the pipeline that we have created or we had created until that point.  And now more stepping back and more generally speaking, we have seen about 100 basis points plus/minus movement in cap rates, which we expected given that if you look at even 14 of the top 20 clients that we have, who have bonds that are trading, you look at what their spreads have done over the last, call it, eight months, nine months, those have gapped out about 100 basis points. So not that, that symmetry is perfectly congruous, but it seems to have been at least in terms of how cap rates have played out. So, you should be expecting to see those numbers being realized starting in the first quarter of 2023. Anthony Paolone : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Good afternoon. Sumit, regarding M&A, is that more or less likely in this environment with these opportunities you're finding in other verticals and portfolio discounts like we saw in CIM 71 cap? Or I mean, this paying a premium for public peer makes sense at this time? Sumit Roy : Greg, that's a great question. Look, -- the -- if you look at the organic market and you've mentioned CIM and some of the other transactions that we've talked about already, there are very good transactions to be had at incredibly good risk-adjusted returns. Having said that, if there's an opportunity on the M&A front where you're able to realize similar economics, I don't see that as being mutually exclusive to be able to pursue both avenues of ultimately what we are charter to do, which is grow the business. But it does have that backdrop to compete against as an opportunity cost when we are looking at M&A. But I don't see there being less M&A because of the environment we find ourselves in. It's just the question of are we going to have partners who are willing to see the big picture, we're willing to see that being part of a particular pro forma company is better for the outlook than not. I think those are the elements that need to sort of play out on the sellers' behalf, in order to perpetuate M&A transactions. But look, we are very happy going down the path that we have -- that we are going down. We did $9 billion of acquisitions last year. I would say that, that's probably -- if you look at companies in our sector that takes care of 80%, 90% of what companies are in terms of their total size. So, we don't have to do M&A in order to continue to grow our business. self, and it makes sense for us to pursue that. We are not going to shy away from that either. Greg McGinniss : Okay. That's reasonable. And just for a second question here. Have the higher cap rates started to bring some of the private and private equity buyers off the sidelines? Or is competition for assets still limited? Sumit Roy : They're certainly out there. The debt capital markets continues to be a constraint for them and their ability to react quickly in this market. I think certainty of close over the last six months has taken on a very different focus for potential buyers who, for a variety of reasons won't monetize their real estate.  And somebody like us, especially when it comes to bigger deals that can have that certainty of close that does not rely on the debt capital markets to finance their deals. I think has a distinct advantage which truth be told has played out in our favor over the last few months. And so yes, private equity will obviously start to sniff around given the higher cap rate environment. But I still don't think that their cost of capital is as competitive as ours and our ability to close still, I believe, stands out when potential sellers have to evaluate who to partner with. Greg McGinniss : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Spenser Allaway : Thank you. As it relates to cap rates, we've heard that the bid spread has compressed faster in the U.S. versus Europe. Is that consistent with what you've seen? And do you think that will dictate how you deploy capital in '23 as you look across both geographies? Sumit Roy : Yes, that's a great question, Spenser. It doesn't have a perfect answer. If you look at the fourth quarter, we didn't do a lot of volume in Europe, circa $350 million, but they had a substantially higher cap rate. And the dynamic that played out there was essentially redemption issues that a lot of funds started to face towards the end of the year.  And that sort of precipitated monetizing their real estate portfolios to help meet those redemption issues, which obviously created an opportunity for somebody like us who, again, does not rely on the debt capital markets, is able to do transactions fairly quickly. And that's what resulted in that much higher cap rate. Because for the longest time in Europe, things were not moving. And that's the reason why the volume was only $387.9 [indiscernible], essentially happened towards the later part of the year, happened very quickly because of the specific dynamics. In the U.S., the trend has been slowly moving in this direction. And again, I think I mentioned this during our third quarter call, much faster than it had traditionally moved when you have a rising interest rate environment. And that's just because so much of the capital was pulled out of the market that it pushed specially sellers who are inclined to monetize their real estate, continuing going down that path has allowed for the cap rates to move. Having said all of that, I do believe that where we find ourselves today is more of a bottoming out of that continued movement of expanding cap rates. And it's settling in the 6.5%, 7% for some of the products. Of course, there are still products that's trading in the high-5s. There's still some one-off assets that's trading in the low-5s, maybe even in the high-4s. We, in fact, sold one of our QSR assets with a 4% in front of it in terms of cap rates. So those markets, we will ignore because those are the tail areas of the cap rate environment. But by and large, we have seen this movement in cap rates play out and it's now starting to mentioned. Spenser Allaway : Okay. That was extremely helpful. Thank you. And there have been headlines regarding a EUR600 million to EUR700 million portfolio being marketed for which has been cited as a bidder. Is there anything you can share on the portfolio in terms of the general makeup or geography of those properties? Sumit Roy : Yes. I wonder what your sources are, Spencer. We really don't want to talk about transactions that we don't have under contract. So -- we may or may not be involved in the transaction that you've mentioned. We can't speak to anything, which is a hypothesis or just a rumor in the industry. Sorry about that. Operator : Our next questioner is Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Sumit, good afternoon. Just curious on an updated perspective on your high-grade philosophy here. I noticed again in the fourth quarter. The share was below your portfolio average even when you back out the Encore. In the past, I know you mentioned -- you have experience in acquiring higher-yielding assets and you're focused on the best risk-adjusted returns. But yet again, it's another quarter, your share of high-grade is far below the portfolio average. So maybe can you kind of give us some updated thinking on how we should think about that dynamic maybe going forward? Thanks. Sumit Roy : I think you've sort of answered the question that you asked, Haendel. Ultimately, this is a game of finding the best risk-adjusted returns, just like you said, and the fact that something tends to be investment grade is an output of that underwriting. It's not something that we seek out. And the counter to what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is a CIM transaction, for instance. Here, we have an $894 million transaction with 48% of the rent coming from investment grade. And we were able to get a healthy cap rate. So that number is going to continue to move. In fact, if you were to just look at the $3.9 billion we did in the fourth quarter and like you did exclude the wind transaction, and one of -- a couple of the larger portfolio transactions that we did, that particular investment-grade number would be right up in the high 40s. So, that's going to fluctuate quarter-by-quarter. And what we need to get comfortable with is based on the risk that we are assuming and part of which is the credit risk are we being appropriately compensated. And if the answer comes back, yes, based on expected outcomes, then we are very comfortable continuing to pursue those transactions. Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful. I wanted to ask about Italy for a moment. Was the investing in the quarter basically the $350 million in Europe that you mentioned in of your earlier remarks? And then maybe can you talk a bit about the relative risk profile, how you're underwriting there versus perhaps the rest of the Europe or the United States? And what's the, I guess, investment appetite for Italy? Sumit Roy : Look, Italy, as a country, definitely has more risk. But again, -- just like when we invested in the grocery business during the midst of Brexit, and we were very particular about the industry and more importantly, the operator within that industry that we were partnering with. If you look at Metro AG, it's an investment grade, very profitable, very well-established business, which is pan-European, I believe it's headquartered in Germany, and it controls 26% of the wholesale business in Italy. They have been established since the early 1970s in some of our locations. And so this is a business that we feel very comfortable with. Think of Metro as a combination of Costco and Cisco. Costco is very much retail-oriented and Cisco is much more professionally oriented. Both those businesses types of businesses is served out of Metro, and that's not going anywhere despite some of the additional country-specific risk that might exist in Italy. There are structural advantages as well that I'm not going to bore you with, which makes Italy a very interesting place to invest. But we are going to be very particular, just like we were in the U.K. and we were in Spain as to who we partner with, what are the concepts that we are going to be exposing ourselves to. And at the end of the day, what is the risk-adjusted return profile, look, taking into account some of these risks in some cases, additional risk that won't takes going into these new countries. But we feel very good about the investment that we've made with Metro in Italy. Haendel St. Juste: And just if I may, the follow-up is, did you -- is it $350 million in the quarter and ballpark, what are the going in cap rates or set of returns? Sumit Roy : No, it wasn't all of $350 million. $350 million was the total investment that we made in Europe. I believe the Metro was \u20ac165 million or \u20ac165 million was the Metro investment. Most of the other investments were in the U.K. Haendel St. Juste: Cap rate? Sumit Roy : You've got the blended cap rate, I believe, in the supplemental. It was 100 basis points north of what we did in the U.S., 7.1% cap rate. Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Just can we just touch on tenant health really quickly. Obviously, occupancy is 99%. I see that the EBITDAR coverage is up slightly quarter-over-quarter. In the past, you sort of talked about sort of stress testing the tent and feeling pretty good. Just outside of the movie theaters, just where is your head at in terms of potential recession and tenant health. Sumit Roy : That's a great question, Ron, especially entering into 2023 with so much uncertainty. Look, our biggest focus right now is on Cineworld and how that's going to -- what that resolution is going to look like. I do believe that whatever that outcome is, it's going to play out within the next few months. It's been in bankruptcy now for the better part of four months, and we have been in negotiations with them, and we'll leave it at that. Outside of that, if you look at our overall -- and again, this is something we share in the supplemental our cash flow coverages, full wall cash flow coverages, those have continued to trend up, largely a function of some of our existing clients continuing to outperform. Companies like Albertsons, et cetera, have continued to generate EBITDA growth on a four-wall basis, and therefore, those coverages have continued to improve. Some of the new transactions that we have entered into have very healthy four-wall coverage ratios. And this is, again, it very much ties in with the comment that I think it might have been handled was talking about why are we doing so many noninvestment-grade. If you look at it from a real estate perspective and you suddenly have coverages north of 4x, 5x in sound businesses, but they don't have an investment-grade rating given their size. Those are businesses that we will pursue. And so that's the reason why our four-wall coverage ratio is now close to 2.9x and it was in the 2.5 or about a year ago. So the health continues to be fairly good. If you look at what is there on our watch list, it's about 4% of our rent is on the tenant watch list. And as you can imagine, a lot of it is driven by the theater business. A lot of the theater assets are on our watch list. And in some cases, we also have assets that may not have a credit issue, but there is a location risk associated with what will happen at the end of the lease term, given the changing demographics, changing competitive landscape, et cetera, et cetera. So that constitutes our 4%, which is slightly higher than what it was a few quarters ago. And it's largely a function of what's happening in the theater space and what we expect will happen in a continued high interest rate environment. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my second question, just touching on gaming. Obviously, the Encore deal closed. How is that going out as you have the assets and more importantly, what's the pipeline look like? How are you guys thinking about more -- doing more acquisitions in the gaming space. Sumit Roy : Yes. So, we are very proud to own this beautiful asset in Boston. We just had a demonstration internally about our presence on LinkedIn and Twitter. And when we posted the news release around closing on this asset, we had a huge jump in following. So clearly, it was appreciated by the audience following Realty Income, and we are very proud to have this partnership with win. They are great operators. They are very good to sort of continue to understand and learn about this particular industry, and we hope to grow this industry. We didn't do this as a one-off opportunistic transaction. And -- it's very much in line with looking for the best operators and trying to get assets that are going to be icons for the given operator, but even outside of that. And I think we have checked all of those boxes on the Boston asset. But finding those types of assets will continue to be we are focused on. And as you can imagine, we have received several inbounds. But for a variety of reasons, we haven't chosen to pursue them because they don't need all of the attributes that we are looking for. So, we will be selective in this industry, but we would absolutely love to grow it over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : There's been a lot of M&A activity in the value-based care. So I was wondering if this is the industry you're referring to, where you see all the opportunity? And if so, would you get the parent's credit on some of these deals? Sumit Roy : End up looking at Oak Street Health, for instance, that CVS ended up buying and they want to monetize some of those real estate then yes, by default, we are going to ask for CVS' credit on this $10 billion transaction that they just consummated. Walgreens has done a similar transaction. Amazon just announced that they did a similar transaction. Yes, it is precisely what we are talking about. We are calling it consumer-centric because we are approaching it from a pure state perspective and trying to find what are the alternatives of the locations that we have already -- and how does -- what are the synergies with this new vertical that we're pursuing. It's certainly not looking at what traditional health care companies are focused on. That's not our forte. That's not our strength. And that has really no interest to us today. But it is the value-based health care that a lot of forward thinking health care companies, operators, health care operators are pursuing. And the derivative of that will be the real estate. It could be our existing pharmacies that are going to be repositioned to health hubs and minute clinics. That's already happening. There's continued enhancement, there's continued higher impediments to switching costs that are getting created. Those are all perfect for us. That's embedded value that doesn't get realized day one, but we love to see that happen. And we also want to be intentional about growing the portfolio by doing the types of transactions that we did in the fourth quarter in this particular area because we do believe in it. Wes Golladay : Got it. And then would you have, I guess, a lot of ground redevelopment opportunities? And then also, it sounds like you would have some redevelopment opportunities. Have you ever done redevelopment funding before? Or is that a big part of the business now? Sumit Roy : We've certainly done redevelopment funding, Wes. If you look at our pipeline dollars today and some of that is repositioning of our existing assets. And we've done some in-house. We've done a lot of it with partners, national partners that we have. And those have been some of the best recapture rates that we have achieved in our portfolio. So when we talk about this 90% overlap in terms of real estate characteristics, of the locations that we currently own and some of these consumer-centric medical concepts, that certainly lends itself to repositioning some of our assets for highest and best use. And we define highest and best use in terms of rent per square foot that we could recapture for a given location that we already own. And so yes, I'd hope to be able to partner with these operators, show some of our existing vacancies, potential vacancies that are going to come down the pike. And reposition these locations to help provide these types of services. So yes, that is out of a value-enhancing proposition that we're going to explore. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Can you talk about your view on interest rates in the capital markets based on your recent capital raising activities? It seems that Jonathan and Steve were busy with several less traditional items with the term loan with multiple extensions and the callable unsecured? Just trying to get a sense of what you're trying to achieve based on the laddering with these instruments. Jonathan Pong : Michael, it's Jonathan. I would say, the activities that we did in January, early January, it's all about financial flexibility. We, if you noticed, did a three-year non-call one, giving us that flexibility after one year to call at par. We also did a one-year term loan, but what two one-year extension option. And so, what we're trying to avoid, especially since we went long on the curve earlier in 2022 with our debt capital raising efforts, what was the lock in rates that these levels are very attractive to us. We would like to think that over the next three years, there will be a more advantageous window for us to tap into the debt capital markets to term these amounts out. And so, it's really about maybe a little bit of a barbell given the activity we did earlier in the year, much lower long-term rates, but also terming out the revolver to an extent and creating that flexibility for us to participate and lower rates if they come. Michael Goldsmith : And my second question, we've talked about each of the new verticals in depth, but just wanted to talk about the big picture associated with this. Does this -- is this a function of something has fundamentally changed with kind of the traditional core retail assets or industrial assets that you are known for. And I guess, does this -- these new opportunities provide more confidence in your ability to consistently hit or exceed the $5 billion of acquisitions that you've guided to the last couple of years? Sumit Roy : That's a very good question, Michael. It's a question that we've asked ourselves. There is a traditional definition of what a net lease company does. And yes, we can certainly be mandated and dictated by that or there was a way for us to step back and say, look, if we look at Realty Income, what is our core strength today, our size and scale, which people have continued to point to as impediments to growth. If you look at the last four years, we've grown our business at 5% CAGR annually. And if you look at the business, this question has been asked for the last 10 years was, we are going to take what has been used by The Street as an impediment and see if we can garner value for us shareholders, and let's just ask the question, what is it that we can do with the core strength of size, scale, cost of capital, that will be difficult for other companies to follow. And if the answer was, sorry, you're constrained by your business model and this is all you should do, and this is all you can do, that would have been the answer. But what we found once we started last the question around redefining this particular space is that there's plenty for us to do. And we are only constrained by our ability to be creative. And ultimately, if we continue to underwrite these verticals and look at it from the perspective of real estate and look at it from the perspective of a net lease suddenly, the answers that start to pop up are very different. And it allows you to do things and allows you to be very creative and create outsized riches for our shareholders. That with due respect, a lot of our peers are going to struggle trying to mimic. They just don't have the scale. And so, if we can help consolidate real estate, through a net lease structure, that is really the only governing principle that should be constraining us. And ultimately be able to show to the shareholders that on a risk-adjusted return, these are as safe, if not in some cases, safer than investing in traditional retail net lease businesses, then it's a win-win. So that's how we are thinking about the business, Michael. And you will continue to see us be very creative. But like I've always done, and like this team here has always done, we will engage with you to share our thesis. And by the way, I do highly encourage everyone to go to the new deck, the investor deck, where we've laid out our thesis in more detail, and you'll see some numbers around -- and you'll find that this is what I think people invest in Realty Income for, and we are just delivering on that promise. Operator : Our next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. John Massocca : So, we're reaching about the hour mark here, so I'll take us back to the beginning a little bit. As we think about the delta in the Plenty transaction between the $42 million committed for the Virginia projects, and the $1 billion headline opportunity? Do you have some kind of like right of first refusal or purchase option to kind of get to that higher number? Just trying to kind of figure out what's in the remaining amount beyond the $42 million for the actual project that's underway? Sumit Roy : So John, the best way to answer that is any real estate development outside of a carve-out for one particular client that I mentioned already, which is a user of their end product, we basically get to take a look at the opportunity. And then if we wish not to pursue it, we don't have to. But we, as their real estate partner will be given an opportunity to look at any real estate development that they enter into over the next five or six years. There's a time frame associated with that. But ultimately, the goal here is to continue to invest because that would mean that they are becoming a more and more successful operator within vertical farming, and we are their real estate partner going forward. But yes, so it is a concept of the optionality lies with us in terms of how much more we invest. John Massocca : Okay. Understood. And then can you provide a little more color on the dental portfolio acquired in 4Q? What made that specific portfolio attractive? And can you provide some color on the credit behind of those assets? Sumit Roy : So it's not rated. It was a situation where you had the operator own both the operations as well as the real estate. And this was a mechanism for them to monetize their real estate and continue to invest in the operations of the business. I think we are very constrained by what it is that we can share. This was a highly negotiated transaction but it is one that we are very excited about. And this is, again, an advent into this consumer-centric medical real estate in a big way, and we felt like it was large enough for us to sort of engage in and talk about, but we can't be more specific than that. You know what our overall cap rate was for the quarter, and this was a very small component of it, given that it was a $4 million quarter. But that's the extent of what we can do about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : What are some of the benefits you hope to achieve by filling in the vacant role of the COO? Sumit Roy : Greg is sitting right here, and he's already -- he's been with us about 1.5 months, and he's already added so much value to all of our discussions. It's very bright mind and now he's going to start blushing, but he's somebody that I've respected. I've known Greg for the last -- I guess now it's almost 15 years. And he has a perspective that he brings to the table that is very unique and is going to be incredibly additive to all of us. Look, our business is becoming more and more complicated. We are becoming a bigger and bigger organization. We need talented people to continue to that. But the most important thing about Greg, in my mind is his integrity and his ability to -- and his leadership qualities and his ability to mentor -- those are all qualities that will be put to good use, especially with the next batch of leaders that we are cultivating internally and he will be a massive help in accelerating them to very senior leadership positions within the Company, which, by the way, this company will need in order to continue to execute its strategy and plan. Linda Tsai : And then just in terms of recurring CapEx being less than 1% of Realty Income's NOI, does this vary whether the properties are domestic or international? And are your new verticals consistent with this threshold to? Sumit Roy : It depends on the type of leases that we have. I will tell you that, for example, an industrial lease tends to have structural and roof responsibilities, that's on the landlord. And so obviously, CapEx there, not maintenance CapEx necessarily, but just CapEx in general -- is going to be higher. Now some of it will be viewed as maintenance. Some of it will be viewed as improving the life of the real estate. So the categorization of that CapEx may be different, but it is very much a function of the lease. I would say that in the U.K., there is even on the retail side, there is not perfectly what we call quad net assets. So we do have a lot more leakage. But lot more leakage is a relative term to very little leakage here in the U.S. And so all said and done, it's not a big part of our business. It's something that we share. It's part of the AFFO. And again, all of that is underwritten when we are thinking about the long-term return profile of investments that we make, obviously take into consideration on the front end before moving forward on transactions. Operator : Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya : Just a quick follow-up on Haendel's question. So again, doing a little bit more in the non-IG space, your watch list is a little bit bigger. On the flip side, your rent coverages are getting stronger and stronger. How do we think about just kind of credit provisioning on a going-forward basis with all these kind of in factors and what you kind of look at as kind of adequate provisioning relative to historical levels, does kind of given the business backdrop. Sumit Roy : Yes. Tayo, it's not a perfect science. You've put forth two data points that we've shared with you that are polar opposites. How in this backdrop of uncertainty we have four-wall coverages that continue to improve, yet we are doing less and less of investment grade, but that goes back to the underwriting. And I already mentioned to you that there are a couple of retail names that are not investment-grade but to have coverages north of 5x. And again, it's a question of are these businesses that we are comfortable with. With the backdrop of this high interest rate environment, we are not going to be doing transactions where you're going to have an operator that doesn't have a business model that can sustain what we are going to experience, especially in the near term because that would not be good. --: But last year was a phenomenal year for us. We had a similar provisioning that we kept adjusting throughout the year and ended up actually having bad debt expense below what we have traditionally experienced in the business. So again, we expect the worst we underwrite to what we expect and allow for the better outcomes to play out. And that's really how we think about our business, Tayo. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. Could you share any specific numbers about the provisioning of like 60 basis points or 75 basis points is the bogie? Sumit Roy : You mean in terms of what we have in the earnings guidance? Tayo Okusanya : In the guidance, yes, in the guidance. Sumit Roy : --: Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Josh Dennerlein : Just one more, just on the tenant front, I don't think we touched the watch list, saw some news on kind of -- or the Red Lobster has been in the news, I guess, they closed a few stores. Any kind of updates on the watch list and maybe just Red Lobster in general? Sumit Roy : You missed it. Somebody else asked us about the watch list. It's right around 4%. You brought up Red Lobster, there were rumors around that Red Lobster was trying to negotiate rents with landlords, I can unequivocally tell you that, that is not the case, at least they haven't reached approached us. There certainly was assets that they have closed again, none of which impacted our portfolio. And there are some challenges with that operation. It represents about 1% of our rent. But again, I do think that some of the missteps that they had made in the third, fourth quarter of last year have essentially been reversed. They were slow to make pricing adjustments. They have rectified that. And they are managing their inventory much better and all of those should result in better performance. But I just wanted to make sure that we were talking about facts and not rumors that have percolated in the rumor mill. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Well, thank you, Dave, for hosting us, and thank you, everyone, for joining in. I look forward to seeing you guys in the upcoming conferences. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

We are pleased to report solid 2023 first quarter results, exhibiting continued momentum in our business. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to our One Team whose efforts enabled us to continue delivering on our growth objectives. I would also like to thank our equity and fixed income investors for their continued vote of confidence.  Our team's efforts and the benefits of our size and scale were reflected in our first quarter results, highlighted by approximately $1.7 billion of high-quality investments acquired at a cash cap rate of 7%. This represents a 90 basis point increase compared to the investment cash cap rate we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year and resulted in an investment spread of 163 basis points, which is above our historical averages. As we have experienced in prior cycles, cap rates for our investments after an adjustment period have historically tended to be positively correlated with interest rates, which is a trend we have largely continued to experience this year after the recent rise in rates. Our ability to access well-priced capital has historically served as a competitive advantage and is a testament to our long history of maintaining a conservative balance sheet and a diversified real estate portfolio, supported by clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Amidst an environment in which capital is expensive and are scarce for many of our clients, our value proposition is even more pronounced. This dynamic is reflected in the recent portfolio acquisitions we have announced, the active deal pipeline we see today and the favorable pricing spread we see for large portfolio transactions vis-a-vis one-off single asset transactions. Our differentiated platform extends beyond the external growth lens. Recently, we have taken steps to leverage the size of our portfolio and the history of our operating business through the continued development of advanced analytics. The objective of this initiative is to develop predictive and prescriptive insights that harness the collective proprietary data that we've accumulated over several decades of investing in managing and releasing single-tenant net lease properties. Our team's proprietary predictive analytic tool leverages the strove of information in our investment underwriting, portfolio management, asset management and development efforts enabling even more informed investment decisions made by our best-in-class One Team members.  As our business grows, so too will the predictive power of this tool, which we believe will generate significant value for our stakeholders as we refine the accuracy, test conclusions and broaden scope across industries, property types and geographies. As part of our core investment thesis, our size and scale have created opportunities to serve as a capital provider for best-in-class partners looking for alternative means of financing given elevated debt costs. In the first quarter, we agreed to acquire up to 415 high-quality convenience stores from EG Group for $1.5 billion. Over 80% of the total portfolio annualized contractual rent is expected to be generated from properties under the Cumberland Farms brand, and we expect to close on this transaction in the second quarter. As illustrated by this deal, we believe our ability to offer not only certainty of close, but also attractively priced capital as a one-stop solution for sale-leaseback transactions is particularly valuable to institutional sellers of real estate today. We believe this will continue to expand our competitive advantage. Internationally, we continue to venture into new geographical verticals and grow the total addressable market opportunity. This quarter, we took advantage of favorable pricing internationally to acquire properties worth approximately $390 million at an initial cash lease yield of 7.6%. After our initial entry into international markets in 2019, we now derive 11.7% of total portfolio annualized contractual rent from those markets. This natural extension of our platform has been a pillar of growth for the last four years and is indicative of our ability to methodically establish and scale a new vertical.  Given the continued momentum in our acquisitions pipeline and our progress to date, we are increasing our 2023 investment guidance to over $6 billion from our prior guidance of over $5 billion. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined with regard to our balance sheet. Subsequent to our April bond offering, which settled on April 14 and we held approximately $5.6 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity totaling $1.5 billion. As a result, our current financial position has afforded us the ability to lean into near-term investment opportunities.  Moving to operations. Our platform continues to generate durable cash flows, which support our stable earnings profile. For the first quarter, we are pleased to report occupancy of 99%, matching last quarter for the highest rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, we generated a 101.7% recapture rate across 176 renewed or new leases executed during the quarter. These results are a reflection of our talented asset management team and our unwavering commitment to core capital allocation principles, which include a focus on industry-leading clients who often operate in a low price point service-based or nondiscretionary industries. Our purposeful diversification across industries, geographies and clients and our emphasis on high-quality real estate locations and rigorous credit underwriting. Our investment philosophy is nuanced and not simply predicated upon the pursuit of investment-grade clients, which ended the first quarter at 40.8% of our annualized contractual rent. Many of our strongest operators, such as Sainsbury's have no public debt and thus are not rated at all. However, the consistency of their operations and health of their balance sheet are favorable attributes that are consistent with those of an investment-grade rated company. We estimate that approximately 5.3% of our annualized contractual rent comes from unrated operators without public debt. We remain committed to investments that offer us attractive risk-adjusted returns as evidenced throughout our history. And going forward, where we believe, based upon our disciplined underwriting and analytics, we are achieving better returns per unit of incremental risk.  I would like to briefly touch on Cineworld which represents 1.3% of our annualized contractual rent. Despite the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we have continued to receive 100% of contractual rent in the first quarter and through April. As of March 31, 2023, we had cumulative reserves of $33 million on our Cineworld properties. Outstanding receivables net of reserves and excluding straight-line receivables were $14.1 million. We remain in discussions with this client and we'll update the market on the outcome of these discussions at the appropriate time.  Before turning the call over to Christie, I would like to highlight that in March, we published our third annual sustainability report which details our ongoing commitment to operating as a responsible corporate citizen for our stockholders, our team, the communities in which we operate and the environment. I'm proud of our continued progress on ESG initiatives as we seek to fulfill our commitment to building sustainable relationships and I strongly encourage all of today's listeners to navigate to the Sustainability page of our website to review the report. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Christie. Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. We work together with our clients and our One Team to achieve a successful quarter on a number of fronts, delivering AFFO per share of $0.98 on behalf of all of our stakeholders. We would highlight that the comparable quarter in 2022 benefited from approximately $10.2 million of rental revenue reserve reversals, resulting in an AFFO per share growth headwind of approximately $0.015 per share in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, higher year-over-year short-term interest rates represented an approximate $0.02 growth headwind as our weighted average interest rate on revolver and commercial paper borrowings was approximately 300 basis points higher than it was in the comparative period in 2022 on a similar average borrowing base. Excluding these two items, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth rate was approximately 3.5% this quarter. As we evaluate the core fundamentals of our business, we remain focused upon delivering for our stakeholders over the long term and are encouraged by opportunities ahead.  To that end, we are increasing the low end of our AFFO per share guidance range by $0.01 resulting in a new range of $3.94 to $4.03, which represents 1.7% annual growth at the midpoint of the updated range. It has been a busy and productive start to the year on the capital raising front. Despite continued market volatility, we have raised approximately $3.9 billion of capital this year excluding $1.5 billion of unsettled forward equity. In April, we closed a $1 billion bond offering, which was comprised of $400 million of 4.7% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and $600 million of 4.9% senior unsecured notes due in 2033, resulted in a weighted average tenure of eight years and semi-annual yield to maturity of 5.05%. The issuance allowed us to satisfy our near-term debt issuance needs while reducing our exposure to variable rate revolver and commercial paper borrowings and to almost zero after our transaction closed on April 14.  In March, we increased our dividend for the 120th time since our public listing in 1994, to an annual rate of $3.06 per share, representing 3.2% growth from the prior year period. Providing a stable and growing dividend is core to our mission at Realty Income, and we take great pride in being one of only 66 constituents in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. I would like to thank our One Team whose focus and diligence has paved the way for our continued growth as we build upon our track record of consistency.  And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christi. In conclusion, during periods of market uncertainty or dislocation we look to unearth value by leveraging the inherent advantages of our platform. These trends include our continued access to relatively attractively priced capital and our portfolio scale, which we seek to leverage to produce unique investment opportunities as a leading sale-leaseback capital provider. When combined with the collective talents of our best-in-class team members to source, underwrite and close on creative acquisition opportunities with strong risk-adjusted returns, we believe we are very well positioned to continue amplifying our competitive advantages on behalf of our clients and stakeholders. We thank all our stakeholders for their support, loyalty and trust in our company.  And with that, we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas. Nate Crossett : I was wondering if you could talk about just deal flow U.S. versus Europe. What was the amount of deals you looked at in the quarter? I think that's a number you usually give. And then on cap rates, last year, the spread of like the cap rates in the U.S. and Europe was pretty low. I think it was almost the same. But this quarter, Europe is 60 basis points wider. I just want to know if there's anything to note there. Sumit Roy : Yes. Thank you for your questions, Nate. Good questions. Let's start with the sourcing numbers. For this quarter, we sourced about $16 billion worth of product, 25% of which was in the international markets. I would say that if you go back to when we started going into the international markets, the composition of international versus U.S. has been roughly around 30%, 70% in that ZIP code, plus/minus 5%. So this is pretty much within that particular range. What you might have noticed, however, is the amount of closing more recently, both in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year. The contribution from the international side has been a little bit lower than what you have traditionally seen. I would say that the international business has contributed about 35% of volume in terms of what we end up closing versus closer to 20%, 22% this particular quarter. And the main reason for that is we saw a delay in adjustments on the cap rate side in the international markets vis-a-vis the U.S. markets. We started to see cap rate expansion in the U.S. towards the end of -- middle of third quarter, fourth quarter and obviously through the first quarter of this year. But we didn't quite have the same experience in the UK market and some of the other international markets, till, I would say, towards the end of the fourth quarter. And what was largely making potential sellers reconsider the market was not so much driven by actual trades taking place, but more idiosyncratic to their particular needs. Around redemption issues or refinancings that were coming near term. And that's largely what's driven these opportunistic transactions that we've gotten over the finish line in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of last -- this year. And that's what's resulted in cap rates being substantially higher than what I would call the norm or what we are seeing in the everyday market in some of these international markets.  So that explains the 60 basis point higher cap rate that we were able to achieve. And I might add, this is excellent product largely driven by idiosyncratic issues being experienced by buyers who wanted to get this off their books to meet some of the things that I've just discussed. So that's the dynamic we've seen... Nate Crossett : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one quick one on development yields. Those are notably below the acquisition yields. Are those just old commitments before rates moved? Or maybe you can describe what's happening there? Sumit Roy : Yes. And Nate, you've hit the nail on the head. It's exactly that. As you know, development obligations have a much longer lead time. So a lot of what you see in -- you saw in the fourth quarter, third quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, though it's starting to move up, it hasn't moved quite as quickly, largely because what you're seeing filtered through the investment numbers, but transactions that we hit struck, I would say, three quarters ago or four quarters ago. But you should expect to see the yield on development creep closer to what we are actually experiencing in the traditional acquisitions market over the next couple of quarters. So it's just a timing issue. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Christie, one was wondering if you could talk through some of the puts and takes on guidance and why only the $0.01 increase at the low end given the increase in the acquisition guidance and the expense categories moving in the right direction? Christie Kelly : Absolutely, Brad. I think first, in terms of what Sumit had discussed and the increase of our acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion, we remain conservative in that front and really looking towards the second half of the year, while things remain strong. As Sumit has discussed, we're really wait and see here as things unfold. I think the other thing, too, in terms of guidance that we've articulated, and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, is really the headwinds that we're seeing from a debt perspective, although we've been very focused on ensuring that we're derisking our balance sheet, and you can see that in the transactions that we've executed through April. We're really looking at where that may unfold in terms of the second half of the year and don't believe that, that will alleviate over and above the competitive cost of capital that we've been able to generate vis-a-vis last year. And I think finally, in terms of the positive trends that you saw in terms of the tightening of the guidance with G&A, we remain particularly disciplined during this macroeconomic backdrop, and are focused on managing our G&A. But further to that, it's the benefits of size and scale. And you can see that over the years in terms of the trends of G&A to revenues. And then finally, from an unreimbursed property expense margin perspective and the tightening there, we're just following in on the positive trends that we've been able to execute upon. Brad Heffern : Okay. And then, Sumit, just thinking about this EG Group deal, are you seeing more of these very large sale-leaseback opportunities versus what you would normally see? And then has the competition for those deals also thinned out? Sumit Roy : No, no, Brad. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's timed out. In fact, the momentum has continued, and we expect that momentum to remain strong. I don't know how many billion-plus deals, but these large transactions what drives some of the near-term financing issues that a lot of companies are going to have to deal with. And with what we are seeing play out in the banking sector with fewer banks out there to provide capital, the cost of that capital being what it is, given the interest rate environment, I do believe that sale leaseback will continue to be a very attractive alternative to raise capital to help address financing needs at these companies. Keep in mind, EG had never done a sale leaseback. They had that option for many, many years. And they chose to go down this path largely to address some of the leverage concerns that they had on the balance sheet. And we expect that trend to continue. So -- and that's the reason why that's the impetus behind why we felt we should increase our acquisition guidance by $1 billion. Operator : And our next question today comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : Just a follow-up on the EG Group deal. Just curious how that deal came together and maybe your ability to partner up further with them? Sumit Roy : Thanks for the question, Josh. So EG is obviously a very well-established name in the U.K. market. Neil and I had been calling on them for a while, along with TDR Capital, they're capital providers for a while. And this is a relationship. We knew they didn't have a high level of interest in necessarily going down the path of sale leaseback when we first started to have conversations with them. But I think that, that relationship ultimately played out to our benefit when we were awarded the deal when they did choose to go down the path of sale leaseback to help meet some of their capital needs shorter term. This was a competitive process. It was run by Eastdil. We went through. We were obviously in close contact with EG directly as well. And there were three finalists, and we felt like we were awarded the deal based on our reputation, surety of close and the fact that we had spent time developing a relationship with them. So that's what really got us the deal at the end. And our ability to be creative and there were certain asks that they had and our ability to meet those certain asks also, I believe, accrue to our favor. So I think all of those factors went towards us being awarded the transaction despite us not being the highest bidder. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. And then maybe changing the topic a little bit. How do you guys think about expanding or growing your exposure to lower credit quality tenants as a way to kind of widen the aperture and maintain growth? Sumit Roy : Yes. Josh, that's a very good question. I'm actually going to go back to the EG Group conversation we just had. If you look at the actual portfolio, 80% of the portfolio is Cumberland Farms. And I just want to remind the group that three years ago, when Cumberland Farms was available for sale, they were all of the natural operators that were very, very interested in this very well-run private company. And what was being bandied about as a potential sale leaseback, the pricing was in the low 5s, high 4 ZIP code. And it ended up being EG Group that won the transaction, and they obviously didn't want any sale-leaseback financing to effectuate the buyout. But that was the quality of the real estate. That Cumberland Farms was demanding at that particular time. Fast forward today, the four-wall coverages on these assets have only improved and improved, I would say, dramatically. So the assets remain exactly the same assets, and we were able to accomplish this transaction at 6.9%.  Yes, if you look at EG Group, the credit that's operating these assets, they are sub-investment grade. But if you look at the quality of the assets, it's exactly the same. And we believe that EG Group is a very good operator of convenience store business. We can see that in the history that they have established in the UK, and we certainly see it in the performance of these assets. When you compare it to where they were performing three years ago and was warranting a price in the low 5s, high 4s to where we were able to accomplish. So now you fast forward and you say, okay, you're getting 150 basis points, 160 basis points of additional spread on this real estate, are you being paid for the credit risk inherent in the operator? And that's where the concept of risk-adjusted returns comes into play for us, and it is so front and center in everything we do. The answer for us was a resounding, yes. We are being compensated. And so for us, we've said this before that investment grade rating is a byproduct of the actual underwriting. It is not something that we seek out. It gets taken into consideration on the collectibility of the rent flow over the 20-year or 25-year leases that we underwrite to. But ultimately, we look at every transaction on a risk-adjusted basis. And if it makes sense, despite the fact that it may or may not have investment-grade rating is something that we are going to continue to pursue. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Sumit you started the call by talking about continued momentum in the business. Can you just talk a little -- REITs tend to be lagging indicators. So can you kind of talk about the visibility that you have into the business and this continued momentum? Just trying to better understand how long of a path that you have where you feel very good about the spreads and the backdrop? Because it seems like it's been -- everything has been pretty solid in the last several quarters. Sumit Roy : Yes. That's a great question, Michael. Things are moving so fast. Every other day, there's a bank in the news. News is super fast. And so how do we think about our business and why do I use phrases like continued momentum. Even though this may be a lagging indicator, we are looking at transactions, these renewals every day. And when we are seeing the fact that we can still continue to generate 102%, 103% re-leasing spreads, yes, it's lagging, but literally weeks, months. And it gives me continued hope that, look, for our product, where we play in the market, et cetera, there continues to be a fair amount of demand. And it manifests itself in some of the positive re-leasing spreads that we share with the market. The second piece, which is much more of a forward-looking statement is what are the continued discussions that we are having that then helps drive our pipeline on the investment side. What are the kinds of discussions that we are having? What's the size of the discussions that we're having, what's the yield associated with those discussions. I think all of that gives us confidence that there continues to be momentum. The fact that we were able to raise $3.1 billion within a period of three months, in the fixed income market, the fact that we were able to close on $800 million of equity and have $1.5 million of unsettled equity available -- $1 billion, sorry, of unsettled equity, again continues to give me confidence that even on our capital side, for us, we continue to sit in a very favorable position. So we have the opportunity. We have the ability to raise capital. We have the ability to make spreads north of what we have historically achieved. And now with the international markets starting to reflect a little bit more of a positive movement for us on the cap rate side. That's what gives me confidence to say that we have continued momentum in the business. Michael Goldsmith : My follow-up question is, it looks like you've opened up an office in Amsterdam. Can you talk a little bit about the advantage that you get from that? Should -- does that mean that we should expect more international deals? Or does this allow you to source deals better throughout Europe? And are there any tax benefits from having an office there? Sumit Roy : Yes. The reason why we needed to open an office in the Netherlands was largely driven by the structure that we have created to allow us the flexibility to continue to grow in the international markets. And by international markets, I primarily mean the UK and Western Europe. This was largely driven by a substance question around having or needing to have employees based in Amsterdam to be able to satisfy this tax structure that we've been able to create to give us this flexibility. So that's largely what's driven a couple of hires that we've made. But most of the other hires will continue to be in the UK and potentially in some of these other countries as we begin to reach a core size in terms of our portfolio. So yes, that's what really drove setting up an office in the Netherlands and hiring a few folks who can help us manage our international business. Operator : And our next question today comes from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street. Harsh Hemnani : So we've heard from some of your peers that perhaps cap rates in the U.S. are closer to topping out. Is that something during the second quarter that you're seeing too? And then the contrast that perhaps in the -- in Europe, you mentioned cap rates only started moving there in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2023. Do you still see more runway there and perhaps that being a tailwind for you relative to peers? And the spirit of this question is not to say that as European cap rates going to expand over the 7.6, I understand that those idiosyncratic deals might not happen every quarter, but is the trend that you're seeing in Europe upwards? And can that benefit your spread value to the peers? Sumit Roy : Yes. Thank you for your question, Harsh. I wouldn't go so far as to say that we see cap rates moving even more in the international markets than they have here in the U.S. I mean, just look at where our 10-year bonds are the price is literally one on top of the other. So they're on those advantages today that we had a year ago. So I don't expect that to be a disproportionate movement in one geography or the other.  Could we see situations, however, unique situations that present themselves that is largely driven by used the word idiosyncratic issues? Yes. And that could garner additional cap rates. But as a market, on average, I don't see there being that much more of an advantage in one market over the other in terms of cap rates. And you're right, you said it correctly that the movement in cap rates was slower in Europe than it was here in the U.S., but I think they've largely caught up. Like some of our peers, it is fair to say that we have not seen continued expansion of cap rates vis-a-vis what we've experienced over the last, call it, 1.5 months, 2 months. But that's not to say that cap rates could not continue to move. There's just a lot of uncertainty in the market today with banks as soon as we start to believe that the banking crisis is behind us, is another name that pops up. And as you know, a lot of these regional banks were the lifeblood of providing financing to developers and to other local real estate operators. And so is it possible that those situations could again manifest itself in for sales, where we could be the beneficiary, which could then have an impact on cap rates. Yes, it's possible. That is why I hesitate to say that the movements in cap rates have played out and it's going to remain where it is today. But I think just like our peers, there has been a settling out, if you will, of cap rates that we have experienced, but I'm not sure if I subscribe to the fact that this game has played out. Harsh Hemnani : That's helpful color. And then you've mentioned in the past couple of calls where vacant asset sales that your income have been going up. Past couple of quarters, all asset sales were vacant. And you said this is kind of going to be the normal course of business, where if that's the best use for those assets and we have better uses for the capital to go out and buy something accretive? That's going to be what you will do. Can you give us a sense for what the buyer pool for these assets look like? Has that changed at all? The demand for these assets over the past couple of years and say versus recover? Sumit Roy : That's a tough question, Harsh. What we are experiencing is there is a price for any asset. And if you are willing to accept the price, I think you pretty much can sell an asset. All of what we have accomplished in the first quarter were vacant sales because that's all we really needed to address. And it was about a 6% unlevered IRR, which is lower than what we have traditionally experienced, largely driven by one or two assets that we just wanted to get rid of because we felt like the long-term prospects or even the short-term prospects for that matter, didn't justify us holding on to these assets. But if you look back, it's traditionally been in that high single-digit unlevered IRR. So it gets into the double-digit levered return profile. And that's what we've traditionally experienced. And I think we should be able to go back to that. In terms of the profile of the buyers in this market, I would say most of the buyers that are interested in buying these assets are folks who want to operate out of these assets. They don't want to enter into a lease. They want to control the assets. These tend to be not institutional quality buyers, but local buyers that want to run a business out of that location and want to own the real estate to do so. That's the profile. Now in the past, we used to have, I would throw developers in the mix. And of course, developers keep sniffing around. But given that the debt markets are a little bit more challenging, there's a little less perhaps demand from that ilk of potential buyers. But I would say today, it's largely owner operators that are driving the sales process. Operator : And our next question today comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : So just touching on sale-leaseback again. I have to imagine there's more operators newly considering sale-leaseback financing. Can you just talk about the types of tenants you're having first-time conversations with, who you might be targeting? I don't know if that's cold calls or through brokers or whatever have happens to be and how you go about finding operators that maybe didn't consider sale leasebacks in the past, but would be open to it now. Sumit Roy : Yes, it's a slew of avenues through which we source and I think it will be very consistent across the board. Obviously, we believe -- we have a curated list of folks that we've been reaching out to speaking with one of which we've already talked about, EG Group, that we didn't have expectations of sale leaseback in the near term, but it just so happened that, that became very compelling to them as a capital source. There are similar names like that. I'm not going to obviously go into the details, as you can imagine, Craig. But this is something that we do here in the U.S. We do this very consistently when we travel to the U.K. and to Western Europe. There are obviously well identified folks who own a lot of real estate who are not in the real estate business, and those are the folks that we've sort of identified and tried to reach out through. The other channels are the more traditional channels, brokers, investment bankers, colleagues who may have worked in certain places who have an in into those places. All of those are avenues that we exhaust to continue to source our transactions. And those continue to remain the avenues of sourcing. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And then I guess just talking about source deal volume a bit here, kind of a multi-parter. So first, when you're talking about source deal volume, does that include the deals where sellers just have unrealistic cap rate expectations? Secondly, do you have some idea or some sense of the level of sellers that maybe are just waiting on the sidelines waiting for financial markets to settle out a bit? And third, how much of the deal volume in the past, do you think it was driven by cap rates trending down, which was enhancing exit IRRs that now is probably a thing of the past. Sumit Roy : So Greg, to answer your first question, yes, even when the cap rate expectations are unreasonable. If somebody is reaching out to us and we've sourced it as a deal, but have no interest in following up, it does get included in our source volume. I would say that a lot of folks, a lot of potential sellers of real estate are sitting on the sidelines. They recognize that the buyer pool is definitely a lot more discerning when it comes to cap rates because they are having to work in the same environment where the cost of that capital is much higher today than it was six months ago. So rather than tainting their product, they're just holding back.  And I think look, I can't prove this 100%. But if you look at our sourcing numbers, it's $16 billion, $17 billion, $18 billion. Those were the three numbers that we had the last three quarters. But it is slightly lower than the $25 billion, $26 billion that we were experiencing in the first two quarters of last year and quarters before that. So some of it is obviously getting played out in the sourcing numbers as well. It's still a very healthy sourcing number. But I think as people wait longer and longer and this turmoil continues, I think we are going to start to see some of these sellers come in and say, look, I have an event, either it be releasing refinancing scenario or what have you, that's going to push them to say, okay, we are willing to accept the fact that we need a higher cap rate. We've had a few of those occasions where 5 months ago or four months ago, we had a grocery operator that came in and they wanted a particular cap rate, and we said that was too rich for us. And we said, okay, this is where we think we could have done that deal. This was about five months ago. They've come back to us today saying, \"Can you meet that? And we said, no, we can't. Our cost of capital has moved, but we could do this. And they are willing to transact at that higher level today. So I know this is one anecdotal evidence of how it's taking time, which is why there's always a lag. But it is starting to play itself out. And I do expect sourcing numbers to start to go out. The longer this turmoil on the lending side continues, which obviously creates wonderful opportunities for us. Operator : And our next question today comes from Eric Wolfe of Citibank. Eric Wolfe : I wanted to follow up on what you just said a moment ago and also your comments around the new banks sort of being in the headlines every other day. Just curious whether anything that's happening right now with regional banks has already started to open up new opportunities for you. I'm specifically thinking about industries that rely on their credit. I think you mentioned some local developers. But just anything that relies on regional bank credit where you might see some opportunities today that were historically available to you? Sumit Roy : Yes. I think, Eric, on multiple fronts, it opens up opportunities for us. Obviously, sale-leaseback as a comparative tool to raise capital, especially when compared against the debt products that's available today, it's very compelling. The cost of that capital raise is lower than what markets are able to satisfy. So I think from the traditional source, it's going to create opportunities. It's also going to create opportunities because you don't have as many lenders today who would have traditionally participated in -- on the secured side of the equation. And there are users of that capital stack that still need to either refinance their capital or just want to raise that in view of doing a sale leaseback. And because of fewer participants, I do think you can position yourself to play in that area because it's very akin to your traditional underwriting with obviously a few more nuances around how you think about debt instruments as an investment. But I think it's going to open up opportunities on that front as well. And a lot of these alternative capital asset managers and capital providers, et cetera, I think they are very well situated to take advantage of those situations as are we. Eric Wolfe : That's helpful. And then just a question on theaters. I know small percentage for you. But I'm just curious what you think needs to happen for there to be a more liquid market for assets. And maybe for Cineworld, specifically, once their balance sheet and leases presumably restructured, do you think there will be a market to sell those assets? Sumit Roy : I think so, Eric. Look, this is consistent with what I've been saying specifically around in a world we remain in discussions. So I'm not going to get into that. There was some news this morning, which I think is very positive for the Cineworld name, where they've actually put out a date when they're planning on emerging. They've been able to attract new capital. So I think all of that is quite positive. But what I have shared on our specific portfolio is around inbounds. There are certain locations that are absolutely in high demand for alternative uses. So in some ways, this is playing out of what is the highest and best use of some of these locations. And going through this process accelerates that ultimate outcome. And so we are -- look, we think we're going to be just fine. It is, like you said, a very small portion of our overall portfolio. To be very honest, I'm very hopeful that by the time we have our next quarterly call that this will all be behind us. And these opportunities that I've been referencing about basically repositioning some of these assets to an alternative use can start to play out, and we can actually start speaking to you about what those opportunities are. But we feel pretty good about the Cineworld situation. Operator : And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Ravi Vaidya : This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel St. Juste. Last quarter, you commented that your watch list is about of 4% of total ABR. Just wondering what that is right now? And what other categories outside of the theaters are you monitoring or have a negative view on . Sumit Roy : Yes. Good question. Our watch list today is right around 4.4%. As you correctly pointed out, it is largely dominated by the theater industry. Some of the other areas that we are continuing to look at. And keep in mind that our watch list is not always a credit issue. It is just our view on the real estate, the location of that real estate and what the ultimate outcome is going to look like. So it's a combination of credit. It's a combination of real estate underwriting. But ultimately, the watch list is dictated by the long-term desirability of those locations and operators. So along with the theaters, I would say, restaurants are in the some of the more discretionary type concepts out there like home furnishing. There are very few day care centers and some of the other businesses that are not very well capitalized that you'll find there. But that's the mists of what you will find on the on the watch list. Ravi Vaidya : That's helpful. One more here. One of your peers sold movie theaters at [7.8], regarding your -- would you consider selling theaters in that range? Or what other -- what are your conversations been like in terms of pricing and regarding the theaters, as you said it was such a large component of the watch list? Sumit Roy : Yes. That's actually a very good pricing. And I suspect that the person that bought it is probably a developer. And we've done our own analysis. And for us, we feel like the best way to create value would be to hold on to these assets and then especially the ones where we have a view that can be redeveloped et cetera, and capture that view once we have full control of that asset. We truly told there is so much discussion that we are having with Cineworld at this point that I don't want to get into the details, but that discussion needs to be behind us. And my understanding is that a lot of these assets that are now going to be put out there for sale, et cetera, have already had their rents renegotiated, everything has already been priced in. And those cap rates that are being shared are being shared off of those new adjusted rent numbers. And in our view, if we feel like, hey, let's just hold on to these assets, we'd much rather get these assets back and reposition it perhaps with some additional capital, but create much more value for our investors, then that's what we choose to do. And we haven't engaged in trying to go out and try to find the market we've had a lot of unsolicited calls. I can tell you that, but we really haven't engaged in trying to sell any of our theater assets. We want to resolve the Cineworld situation. And I think with the news today, I think that date is certainly getting closer before we start to figure out what the best economic outcome is. Operator : And our next question today comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : A couple of quick ones. Just going back to the opening comments on the international portfolio at 11.7%. Just thinking about where could that number go? Obviously, there's different tax it so forth. But in your mind, how can that number trend in the next couple of years, obviously, opportunity driven. Sumit Roy : Well, these last couple of quarters, they have still represented 20%, 25% of our transaction volume. So clearly, that over time should continue to drift up. It was drifting up at a much higher clip when we were doing a lot more transactions. And I do expect for us to get back into that more normalized 30%, 35%, maybe even more if certain situations play out. So I'm hopeful to keep growing our pie. Look, we continue to look at new geographies, and especially at a time like this, new geographies that seemed a bit out of our reach are starting to become a little bit more within our reach and more compelling today. So as we keep adding new geographies, as we continue to enhance our relationships, et cetera, I see this number 11% continue to grow and be a bigger part of the overall portfolio. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then if I could just touch on sort of two verticals : one, consumer-centric medical to gaming, which I don't think has been mentioned before, but just a quick update on what the opportunity set is looking like? Has it slowed down with the events over the past couple of weeks and so forth? And how are you guys thinking about those? Sumit Roy : So gaming continues to be of tremendous interest to us, Ron. It's just hard to replicate what we got with the Boston asset. And we have an amazing partner in Craig at Wynn, and we will continue to try to work on trying to find new transactions that I don't know if we'll ever be able to replicate the one in Boston, but of a similar type of a similar dominance in particular markets. So we are looking at transactions. We are looking at transactions every day. And the pricing expectations is perhaps something that we are still trying to work through. And if we can get to and understanding which works for parties involved, I think, and I hope we are able to grow that part of our business, but it's not a fait accompli. I mean it is -- the bar for us is higher. But the good news is there is a product out there that meets that bar. So we are very hopeful. With consumer-centric, we -- that's a business we love. We've been in that business. We've just coined the phrase to sort of define an area of our portfolio that we've obviously been very interested in. And with the dental transaction that we did in the fourth quarter of last year, that helped accelerate that part of the business. Look -- and I don't want to get into the thesis again. I think we've shared that already for a variety of reasons, we like that business. And I think in some ways, this is a business that is getting defined right in front of our eyes, and we want to participate in the potential upside that I see on the real estate side. And so again, partnering with the right operators, forward-thinking operators who share a similar philosophy of delivery of health care, I think will, I hope, result in a slew of transactions for us on the consumer-centric side. So both those areas remain of high interest to us, Ron. Operator : And our next question comes from John Massoca with Ladenburg Thalmann. John Massocca : Both on the our market here. So I just have one question. Obviously, there was a same-store decline in [indiscernible], which was kind of explained, but there was also a same-store decline in your QSR portfolio. I'm just kind of wondering what was driving that. Is that some of the credit issues certain franchise operators had earlier this year or something else that's kind of idiosyncratic? Sumit Roy : No, no. It's -- look, the overall same-store decline was largely a function of what Christie touched on to explain why our AFFO per share was flat. It was basically -- if you look at the reversals we took in the first quarter of '22 versus the reversals that we took in 2023 first quarter, there was a net $9 million reversal that was very positive in the first quarter of 2022 that we didn't have we had to compare against in this quarter. And when you look at same-store calculation, obviously, that's what drove that very benign same-store growth number. Absent that, if you were looking at just the core portfolio, our growth would have been 1.5%. The specifics around QSR is more driven by a couple of concepts that are not doing very well. Boston market continues to be in the news. It's a very small portion of our overall allocation, I think, basis points at this point. But that is what drags the same-store sales numbers same-store growth numbers for that particular industry. So it's very specific to a couple of names. But overall, like I said, we were around at 1.5%, had it not been for these reversals in the first quarter of last year. . John Massocca : Okay. And maybe what's the overall view on kind of the franchise restaurant base that kind of rough turn of the year, but have things stabilized at all given kind of the continued strength of the consumer? Or just kind of when you talk to tenants when you look at new deals, what's the outlook there for that specific tenant industry? . Sumit Roy : Yes. It's what you would expect, John, Casual dining is depending on the concepts, some concepts continue to post very good results. Like Outback, I saw the results not too long ago. They had positive same-store growth. I think Chile has had a similar story. But then you look at other concepts, they're not doing as well. Thankfully, the two that I mentioned are our two largest exposures. But we do have some smaller concepts. And it's a smaller concept that if they don't have the balance sheet wherewithal to increase prices or pass through some of the costs, et cetera. they're going to struggle. And again, it's not -- none of this is a big part of our portfolio and all of which there are areas that we are focused on. It's already part of our watch list. But that's where I expect to see some level of disruption, but nothing new is expected based on what we see today. Operator : And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : Just a quick one. Just a broader question on the overall market. When you look at the amount of dry powder available on the sidelines to deploy towards net lease, which industries are you seeing the most demand? Sumit Roy : That's an interesting one, Linda. If we just look at it and I look back, I think it's convenience stores and grocery. Those are the industries that we we're able to do the most deals in and -- but that's a selective selection bias that we have. Those are the industries we like. And so I can't answer that across the board. But what I will tell you is, yes, you're right, there's a lot of capital, but that cost of capital is not uniform. That's one of our biggest advantages that we have a cost of capital that continues to be incredibly competitive and lower than almost everyone. So in some ways, we find ourselves in a very favorable position to take advantage of what we are seeing in the market. But we are very focused on areas of interest to us. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for your attendance today. We look forward to meeting with many of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference in June. Thank you. . Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Bakke, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Steve Bakke : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We\u2019ll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. We successfully executed on our strategy in the second quarter and continue to see momentum across the business. I would like to sincerely thank our One Team whose focus and commitment to continue to propel our business forward, serving all our clients and stakeholders. We believe the strength of our platform and quality of our real estate portfolio were evident in the quarter\u2019s results. Despite a challenging interest rate environment, AFFO per share grew 3.1% from last year to $1 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered a total operational return of over 8% on a trailing 12-month basis. Delivering stable and consistent growth is foundational to our mission at Realty Income. Underlying this growth, our team continues to source and invest in high-quality properties at accretive spreads to our cost of capital while partnering with our clients who are leaders in nondiscretionary, low-price point and service-oriented industries. Partnering with industry leaders across over 13,000 properties in a diversified real estate portfolio offers us durability of cash flows that results in the predictable nature of our revenues, earnings and dividend payments. Our investment activities remain robust as we continue to demonstrate that size and scale are unique advantages in the sale-leaseback and portfolio transaction markets. In the second quarter, we closed on approximately $3.1 billion of high-quality real estate investments, which brings our year-to-date investment activity to over $4.7 billion. Cap rates in our acquisitions appear to have stabilized after a meaningful adjustment period to a higher interest rate environment. Though in select situations, we continue to find unique opportunities to source and close on larger transactions where our relationships, platform and access to capital allow us to take advantage of more favorable terms. Our second quarter initial cash lease yield of 6.9% represents a 120 basis-point increase compared to the second quarter of 2022 and resulted in a realized investment spread of approximately 133 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis using the cost of equity and debt raised in the quarter. In addition to closing our $1.5 billion U.S. convenience store acquisition from the EG Group, we remained active internationally during the second quarter, closing on $416 million of investments at an initial cash lease yield of 7.1%. This international activity includes the addition of a new geographic vertical in Ireland where we acquired two properties for $54 million at healthy cash yields. Given the transaction velocity we have achieved in the first half of the year, we are increasing our outlook for investments to over $7 billion for 2023. Year-to-date, we have acquired 15% of source investment volume compared to an average of 7% over the last five years. In today\u2019s more constrained environment for capital, we have found the size and scale of our platform have become increasingly meaningful differentiators as we seek accretive growth opportunities. Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to perform, and we ended the quarter with occupancy of 99%, the third consecutive quarter at that level. This matches our highest occupancy at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, our rent recapture rates increased from last quarter to 103.4% across 201 new and renewed leases, bringing the year-to-date recapture rate to 102.7% across 377 new or renewed leases executed in the period. As further testament to the stability of our portfolio and the leading clients with whom we partner, our client watch list declined from last quarter and now represent less than 4% of our annualized rental revenue. This is the lowest level in the last five years. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2.0% in the quarter, a tangible result of our purposeful decision to seek investment opportunities with higher internal growth characteristics as well as the benefit of uncapped CPI-based rent escalators, present in nearly 30% of the leases in our growing international portfolio. Our efforts to increasingly pursue leases with meaningful contractual rent escalators has helped contribute to a portfolio with contractual rent growth at approximately 1.5% per annum as of the second quarter, or 2% annual growth on a levered basis. Before turning it over to Christie, I would like to recognize the tremendous value she has brought to Realty Income, first as a Board member, and then as Chief Financial Officer. Her leadership and counsel through a very active period for our company has left a lasting positive mark. As well, I would also like to congratulate Jonathan on his upcoming promotion to CFO. Christie? Christie Kelly : Thank you, Sumit. It\u2019s an honor to serve our colleagues, Board and stakeholders during this exciting time at Realty Income. As we previously announced at the end of this year, I will be retiring as CFO and passing our CFO baton to Jonathan Pong, who is our current Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. Jonathan has been with the Company for the last nine years and brings significant experience to the role, having overseen our capital markets, investor relations, FP&A and derivatives functions during his time here. Over the last 2.5 years, since joining the management team, we have worked closely together as part of a planned succession, and Jonathan is well positioned to carry the torch moving forward. With that, I would like to hand the call over to Jonathan to go over the financial results from our quarter. Jonathan Pong : Thank you, Christie. I would be remiss without acknowledging your many contributions to the Company and its stakeholders during your tenure. I\u2019m grateful for your guidance, support and leadership, all of which have laid the foundation for excellence as our business continues to evolve. Over my 9-year, 10-year at Realty Income, we have experienced significant growth in new industry verticals, geographies and property types. However, we\u2019ve continued to view a reliable growing dividend and a well-capitalized balance sheet as critical components of our business. To that end, we finished the second quarter with healthy leverage as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 5.3 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio remains solid at 4.6 times. We are once again active issuers of equity capital via the ATM, raising approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate in the second quarter, $651 million of unsettled forward equity remains outstanding as of today. As our platform has advanced and grown over time, our investment spread business has been supported by access to a wide range of products in the capital markets. Last month, we added another capital source to our inventory, raising \u20ac1.1 billion through our debut public offering of euro-denominated unsecured bonds. This dual tranche offering resulted in a weighted average tenure of 9 years and a weighted average annual yield to maturity of 5.08%. Establishing a presence in the euro unsecured bond market allowed us to diversify our fixed income investor base, and generate a natural hedge for yield denominated earnings and access of source of debt capital that was priced approximately 60 basis points inside of indicative U.S. dollar bond pricing at the time of execution. Proceeds from the offering effectively repaid short-term borrowings on a multicurrency revolver and commercial paper programs, which had a combined balance of $990 million at quarter end. Combined with $254 million of cash on hand at quarter end and the $650 million of forward equity previously mentioned, we believe we are well capitalized with significant liquidity heading into the third quarter. Finally, from an earnings outlook perspective, the midpoint of our 2023 AFFO per share guidance is unchanged, though we are narrowing the guidance range of $3.96 to $4.01, representing approximately 1.8% growth at the midpoint. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. As our second quarter results illustrate, our company is well positioned to provide consistent results in a variety of economic environments and to grow through a variety of different acquisition channels. The optionality we have to toggle between different sources of capital is also a competitive advantage as it broadens our reach of investors and oftentimes provides a lower cost of capital alternative to the public U.S. dollar market. Looking at the S&P 500 constituents within our addressable market, we count approximately 300 firms with $1.6 trillion of owned real estate. To quantify the near-term opportunity, which is available to us as sale-leaseback capital providers, this group has approximately $1.2 trillion of debt representing 34% of the group\u2019s outstanding debt capital maturing between 2024 and 2027. Meanwhile, corporate bond deals have risen anywhere between 240 and 400 basis points from the 2021 average to today. This compares to a 140 basis-point increase in initial cash lease yields for Realty Income\u2019s investments over the same time frame, making our capital solutions even more competitively priced on a relative basis than in the past. Because of this cost of capital convergence and because of the many benefits sale-leaseback financing provides, including the elimination of maturity risk, we believe there is a more compelling case to be made than ever for corporates to look to sale-leaseback financing to replace maturing debt. As the attractiveness of sale-leaseback financing accelerates for corporates with looming debt maturities and elevated debt costs, we believe our growth opportunities will continue to expand on a sustainable basis. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Maybe just a question on guidance. Maybe you could just unpack, you guys increased acquisition and volume guidance but the midpoint on AFFO remained the same. Maybe you can just kind of go over the puts and takes there. And then also, what are you guys assuming for kind of cap rates in your guidance, I think were down 10 basis points in the quarter. What\u2019s kind of the outlook of the pipeline right now? Sumit Roy : So Nate, I\u2019ll take your second question first, and then I\u2019ll hand it off to Jonathan to talk about puts and takes with regards to the earnings guidance. With regards to the cap rate, we are assuming the cap rate to be within the ZIP code that we\u2019ve announced in the second quarter and in the first quarter. That\u2019s where we believe where the cap rates have settled down. Opportunistically, there are situations that we could enter into where we could drive those cap rates higher. But for modeling purposes, I would request that you keep it within these ZIP codes that we\u2019ve announced in the first and second quarter. Jonathan? Jonathan Pong : Hey Nate, on the guidance question, I would, first of all say, the midpoint of our guide is the same as the as it was at the start of the year. And so, when you think about how we put guidance together, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes that we look at, at the beginning of the year, revisit at every quarter. We know that on a probability-weighted basis, not all of the takes are going to happen and all the puts are going to happen. And so when you think about acquisition guidance increasing two quarters now, that was a scenario that we had expected at the start of the year, but there was always going to be puts and takes that could offset that a bit. I think the biggest one for us has been short-term interest rates. When you look at what was implied back in January and February on the SOFR forward curve, you compare that to what it is implying today, about a 40 basis-point increase. And so that alone is $0.01 per share for our business in the back half of the year. So I would say that, and there\u2019s also some other things that we always get that maybe we\u2019re taking a slightly more conservative view on over the second half of the year appropriately, but we feel very good about being more or less accurate from what we came out at the start of the year. Nate Crossett : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just one on the debt rates are much lower in Europe. You did that recent bond deal. Can you just like talk about how much you could kind of theoretically raise over there to kind of take advantage of the better cost of capital? Are there any like hindrances like in terms of size? Jonathan Pong : Yes, Nate. We\u2019re not going to go crazy and have significantly more liabilities denominated in one currency relative to the assets we have denominated in that same currency, especially when it\u2019s foreign denominated. And so for us, when we\u2019re going out and issuing in various currencies, we\u2019re thinking about the income statement, FX risk that we might have, and we\u2019re using the natural interest expense in that currency to serve as a hedge. If we don\u2019t have that, there\u2019s not a lot of reason for us to go out and do that type of issuance. We also know that we have a very active acquisition pipeline across all currencies. We know that we\u2019re going to need the capital at some point really denominated in dollars, sterling or euro. So, that\u2019s how we think about it. It was a 60 basis-point pickup relative to comparable U.S. dollar, but for us, it\u2019s really about diversification. And so, you can expect us to utilize everything in our toolkit going forward. But I think we are all set on the euro side, at least for the near term. Operator : The next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : So, as always, I\u2019m interested in any larger portfolio deals. And we appreciate your opening remarks regarding the size of the potentially addressable S&P 500 market. But have you noticed any material uptick in sale-leaseback interest from those companies at this point, or is that still a developing potential? Sumit Roy : I guess, we have to post one of these large transactions per quarter. And I think we\u2019ve done that. If you look at what we\u2019ve done in the fourth quarter of last year, that\u2019s when we closed on the gaming asset, which was $1.7 billion. You look at the large portfolio deal we did in the first quarter, it was a CIM transaction. That was circa $900 million. And in the second quarter, we\u2019ve announced the $1.5 billion and closed the $1.5 billion EG Group transaction. And look, the reason why we are sharing all of this data is to help support what we are seeing develop in our pipeline and the conversations that we are having currently. Now, how much of that gets translated to close transactions, time will tell. But clearly, we are very optimistic. And that is one of the main drivers of why we have increased our guidance by another $1 billion in terms of acquisitions. So, we just feel like -- I wish our cost of capital was slightly better. But in terms of actual transactions, we feel like the pipeline is robust and it\u2019s largely a function of what is happening in the debt capital market. Greg McGinniss : Okay. What are your thoughts on increasing maybe the level of tenant debt investments to push earnings growth higher and offset some of that cost of capital? It\u2019s not exactly where you want it. Sumit Roy : Well, we think of ourselves as an investment company. And Greg, so where we invest on the capital stack is always available for debate within the four walls of Realty Income. And wherever we feel like we can quantify the risk and underwrite the benefits of doing a sale-leaseback versus doing a direct loan to one of our clients, we are going to go down the path of whichever yields the best risk-adjusted return. So, yes, we haven\u2019t done one of those, but it is certainly up for discussion, and it\u2019s one that we have been discussing with my colleagues here at Realty Income. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern : Sumit, can you give your updated thoughts on how you feel about the theater business broadly right now? Obviously, AMC recently reported its best week, but then you have the strikes, which will theoretically start affecting things at some point and the release schedule isn\u2019t back to normal. So, are you feeling worse at this point or better given the recent strength? Sumit Roy : Yes. So Brad, I\u2019ve always stated this about the theater business that it is largely a function of content. And as long as the content continues to develop and it goes back to levels that it was pre-pandemic, which was circa 70, 75 big tent type releases, we\u2019re going to get back to levels pretty close to the revenue levels that we had in 2019. And anytime you have situations like the one that you\u2019ve just described where you have a strike, it does obviously put a little bit of a breaker in terms of the ability of studios to continue to release those big tent movies. The good news in today\u2019s environment versus the last time there was a strike, which lasted, if I remember correctly from -- for about four months. The good news today is we\u2019ve got a lot more studios beyond the big four that are releasing big budget movies, and I\u2019d put Amazon and Netflix in the mix there. But yes, all else being equal, a strike is not a good thing. Do I see this having a near-term impact, I don\u2019t think so because a lot of these movies have already been completed, and it\u2019s just a question of staging the release. But longer term, it could have a disruption on how many of these movies get released. And so, we are watching this closely. I believe there\u2019s a meeting on Friday, where the studios are getting together with the writers and the actors and all of that. And my hope is that there\u2019s a resolution soon. And -- but yes, it is a situation that we are monitoring closely. But my expectation, if it is anything like what it was last time, this should resolve itself in the next couple of months. Brad Heffern : Okay. I appreciate that. And then can you give your expectations for the Cineworld sites that were rejected and maybe talk through some of the opportunities with those, whether it\u2019s just typical releasing or if there\u2019s a development opportunity for any of them? Sumit Roy : Yes. So Brad, I\u2019m not going to give -- go into the details of the Cineworld situation, just because we haven\u2019t quite penned the contract yet. What I will say is that any of the potential economic outcomes have been completely reflected in our updated earnings guidance. So, that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to leave it with the Cineworld situation. And I\u2019ll just add something to stuff that I\u2019ve already talked about in the past, there will be a few assets that we expect to get back. And we have already started to look at what are the alternatives at those particular sites. And the gamut runs from a complete redevelopment of the site to an alternative use, i.e., industrial to situations where we have a retailer coming in and talking about potentially just taking the asset as is, even though they\u2019re not movie theater operators, to potentially re-entitling the asset for an alternative use and selling it, i.e., creating more value for ourselves. And the last bucket will be just selling the asset as is. So, all of those various permutations are being considered on a handful of assets that we expect will get rejected through this process. But, I\u2019m not going to go into any more detail than that. Operator : The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Sumit, I\u2019d like to go back to a conversation we\u2019ve had in the past on i-grade. You continue to source deals here with a lower share of i-grade than historically. And I know in the past, you\u2019ve talked about that your experience in acquiring higher-yielding assets and you\u2019re focused on generating the best risk-adjusted returns. But this quarter, particularly, we had a big drop, but it continues the trend of having below average i-grade. So I guess, is this a dynamic that we should just expect to continue going forward? Is this a new norm? How should we think about the share of i-grade going forward? Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Thank you for that question, Haendel. So just to continue to reiterate the point, we are not targeting investment-grade. What we are targeting are opportunities that yield the best risk-adjusted return. If it so happens that it is an investment-grade client and so be it. But ultimately, it\u2019s the economic profile of that investment that\u2019s going to dictate as to whether or not we are going to invest. Today, truth be told, we are looking at some of these investment-grade opportunities and cannot pencil the risk-adjusted returns. We are finding far more value in areas where we\u2019re looking at subinvestment-grade tenants who are willing to give us a return profile that is commensurate with the inherent risk in that particular opportunity. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the approximately 26% year-to-date investment-grade closings that we\u2019ve done and is close to 18%, I think, for the second quarter. But that\u2019s how we think about the world. And the other thing I\u2019d just point out is just to make it equivalent because I have seen some of these cap rates being reported and there\u2019s a bit of a mixed match. When we\u2019re talking about a 6.9% cash lease yield, if you layer in the straight line, we\u2019re talking about an additional 100 basis points. And I\u2019ve seen certain reports that are sort of conflating these two numbers. So just to make it apples-to-apples, our straight line yields are closer to 7.9% on $3.1 billion worth of acquisitions. That\u2019s where we are seeing the value, with, I would argue, much better growth profile. And clearly, that\u2019s represented in the 100 basis points of increase when compared to cash yields. So that\u2019s how you should think about us Haendel. And if it just so happens that this dynamic were to shift and suddenly investment-grade was to go back to our 40%, 45% that we have in our portfolio, then that will be it. But it\u2019s not something that we target, and you shouldn\u2019t expect us to be targeting that number going forward. Haendel St. Juste: That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate the color there. And one more. I guess, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on investing in gaming assets today. I know in the past, you\u2019ve talked about having an interest. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing anything out there today that would interest you, what type of returns or incremental spreads you require there? And specifically, your potential -- or your level of interest in a potential Bellagio trade. Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. So again, I\u2019m not going to talk about specifics, but I\u2019ll repeat what I\u2019ve said in the past about our desire to grow our gaming vertical. We are obviously looking at many opportunities. And thankfully, it\u2019s a fairly robust environment today for gaming. And yes, in terms of how we\u2019re going to view these opportunities, it\u2019s along the lines of how I answered the previous question. So that\u2019s what you should expect from us for this particular vertical. Operator : The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : I just -- I saw your cap rates on -- it looks like domestic acquisitions is about 6.8% and then, for developments, it was like a 6.9%. Some basis point spread seems kind of small. So just -- is that a function of kind of when deals were struck or just the risk profile of the tenants or just something that you\u2019re seeing broadly in the market? Sumit Roy : Yes. Very good question, Joshua. As you know, when you enter into transactions that have a long duration associated with it, which is what development by its very definition, is going to have. It does become a function of when were those transactions entered into and what\u2019s the duration of that build-out period. And so, what you might have noticed is if you\u2019re tracking our development yields over the last few quarters, you\u2019ve noticed a marked increase in those cash yields on developments. It\u2019s largely a function of when did we strike those. So things that you\u2019re starting to see filter through in the second quarter, which has a similar yield to what you saw on the domestic side, it\u2019s largely a function of us having entered into those transactions over the last two to three quarters, when we were anticipating a much higher interest rate environment and therefore, being able to work with our clients to get that yield reflected in the development cycle. And you should continue to see that. Trends slightly higher looking into the next few quarters as some of the older generation development opportunities start to sort of get fully developed and are -- become cash paying opportunities. So I think just keep a close eye on that and that\u2019s the trend you should see manifest itself over the next few quarters. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then I think Jonathan might have answered this, but I just wanted to clarify, the top end of guidance, it looks like you took down $0.02. Was it just the interest rate environment that\u2019s pushing down -- put downward pressure on that top range or anything else in there? Just curious, given acquisition guidance a bit, so. Jonathan Pong : Hey Josh. To address that, Sumit brought it up earlier, the impact of what we felt was the greatest uncertainty out there, the Cineworld resolution, tat impact is now that is known to us. And going into the quarter, it was something where there was a range of possibilities that we built into the high end and the low end. And so with a greater sense of confidence now where that\u2019s trending, we felt that it was appropriate to take the high end down by $0.02 in addition to bringing the low end up by $0.02. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Jonathan, you\u2019ve been with Realty Income for a while, and I think you\u2019re developing a reputation for a creative solution from a financing perspective. But as you move into the CFO seat, is there anything different that -- is there anything different that you would think about doing in their new position or different approaches to what Realty is doing overall? Thanks. Jonathan Pong : Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the question. I would say, look, what\u2019s made Realty Income so successful over the years, regardless of what we\u2019ve done, what verticals we\u2019ve established, it\u2019s commitment to a fortress balance sheet. And that\u2019s the one thing that is going to be sacrosanct to us for as long as we\u2019re in existence in these seats. And so, we\u2019re not going to sacrifice things like the A3 minus credit rating that we worked very hard to get. We\u2019re not going to sacrifice the trust of the fixed income community that now spans across three different currencies. And so, you\u2019re going to see us continue to focus on low leverage, plenty of liquidity and we\u2019re going to be very predictable from that standpoint. I think going forward, given the added complexity of the business, the volume, the transaction volume that we see, the different countries that we\u2019re in, and we\u2019ll continue to be in, I think it\u2019s really more of a focus on more of the internal operations now. The external side of things, I think we\u2019re pretty well established. We\u2019re going to continue to be creative. But I think it\u2019s about building and continuing this momentum on the internal platform that we\u2019ve created, which we think is a differentiator in the net lease industry and frankly, in the real estate industry. Michael Goldsmith : And Sumit, you mentioned your size and scale as a competitive advantage, at least twice, if not 3 times on the call. Do you feel like -- do you feel like your competitive advantage is growing? Are you seeing fewer bidders on some of the larger deals out there? Is that gap and the strength of the size and scale, is that improving and widening versus peers? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Thanks for the question, Michael. I might have actually said it four times. I\u2019m not sure. I just believe in it so much. And it\u2019s really not something that we believe. It\u2019s what we are hearing. When we are engaging in these conversations with clients who are big clients who have big questions that they\u2019re trying to answer, it\u2019s the fact that who gets invited to the table. And when we see that we are the only REIT in the net lease space at the table competing against private sources of capital, that in itself gives us continued confidence that we are playing a game that is very different from some of our smaller peers. And we want to be that. We want to be the real estate partners of choice for the S&P 500 names. We want to be the first name that is considered when we -- when folks think about -- they have the ability to write big checks. They have the ability to stand by what it is they say. Their reputation speaks for itself and their ability to close is bar none. And when we hear those comments from clients who work with us and more recently with some of our new clients who\u2019ve been added to our registry, it gives us continued confidence to say that our scale and size is being appreciated within this space. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Wolfe of Citi. Please go ahead. Eric Wolfe : Just wanted to follow up on Greg\u2019s question. When you look at your S&P peers, just curious what percentage would you say are receptive to the sale-leaseback conversation? And how has that changed versus a couple of years ago? Just trying to understand how your addressable market has changed. And for those that perhaps aren\u2019t as receptive what\u2019s the typical pushback? Sumit Roy : I can\u2019t give you percentages, Eric. But what I can point to is just look at some of the larger transactions we\u2019ve done and who have we done it with. And they\u2019re all first time sale-leaseback candidates, right? Think about Wind. [ph] They were -- they\u2019ve never done a sale-leaseback before, and they chose to do it with us. Think about EG Group they\u2019ve never done a sale-leaseback before. Their best chance of doing a sale-leaseback was when they actually ended up being the winners in the Cumberland Farms portfolio. This was three, four years ago. And they chose not to do it at that time. And so part of the reason why I believe that sale-leaseback as a product is maturing, is certainly driven by the capital markets environment that we find ourselves in and suddenly finding that sale-leaseback as an alternative to raise capital is quite beneficial vis-\u00e0-vis as we were traditionally being compared to the debt capital markets, especially for names that are lower investment-grade or sub-investment-grade candidates. And so I believe that that will continue. And there will be other transactions that we hope to get over the finish line that we can speak to. That will again be first-time candidates. And yes, we feel like that that will continue to grow. Eric Wolfe : That\u2019s helpful. And then you look at the 10-year or whatever interest rate you want to look at and it\u2019s up pretty meaningfully over the last couple of weeks. When you see moves like this and how quickly will you adjust your pricing on future acquisitions or potentially even re-trade some deals, just trying to understand how sort of real-time capital market volatility changes and return all those? Sumit Roy : Yes. So Eric, I\u2019m going to have Jonathan talk a little bit about things that we try to do to anticipate what I\u2019ll call unanticipated movements in 10 years, okay? We talk about a hedging strategy that we have in place. But I just want to make one point very clear. Our cost of capital gets mark-to-market pretty much by the second. That\u2019s not how cap rates move. There is absolutely a lag time, how sticky these movements, these upward movements and the cost of capital -- people have a different opinion about how sticky that is. And that drives their view around what cap rates should be. And it does take time for people to adjust to a higher cost of capital environment. And if there\u2019s a lot of volatility that makes that adjustment period that much more difficult. So yes, we\u2019ve seen movements on the 10-year from 3.86 to 4.17, 4.18 today within a matter of days, you\u2019re not going to see a 30 basis-point movement in cap rates to reflect this movement in 10-years, unless we see that this 4.7 -- I mean, 4.17, God forbid, 4.7. 4.17, 4.2 become a more sustainable rate. But then what do we do balance sheet perspective to sort of anticipate those situations? I\u2019ll have Jonathan speak to that. Jonathan Pong : Thanks, Sumit. We\u2019ve been very active on the hedging front, both for FX, which I alluded to earlier, but also on the interest rate front. If you look at the 10-Q from the first quarter, you\u2019ll see that we actually purchased swaptions, which really go out until January of next year that protects us against rising rates on the tender. The reason why we chose 1 billion, the reason why we went out to January is because we do have some debt maturities coming up of around $1 billion, $1.1 billion in the first quarter of next year. We put those hedges in place in late March, early April and as far as you might imagine, it\u2019s pretty healthily in the money right now. So from that standpoint, we\u2019ve taken out the primary balance sheet risk -- or refi risk that we have coming up over the 6 to 9 months, but we\u2019re always going to look for opportunities where we see a risk, we want to be proactive. We can\u2019t time to market, but what we can do is mitigate the exposure that we have on potential risk. And so -- that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve done now twice, and the first time we did it was the middle of pandemic, and we were able to monetize that what swapped at a $72 million gain. We\u2019re not always going to be so fortunate, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about managing risk. Operator : The next question comes from Wes Golladay of Baird. Wes Golladay : Can you talk about what\u2019s going on in the UK? It looks like volume was low. I\u2019m just curious if this is a function of just low deal volume, or is it just pricing, just lagging still over there? Sumit Roy : Yes. Neil needs to work a little bit harder, I think. It really is a timing issue as we had some great momentum towards the end of last year driven by pressures that funds were experiencing on the redemption side and it created some amazing opportunities for us. That momentum continued into the first quarter. Second quarter was still very healthy. We did about $420 million which is a big number, but it\u2019s just -- it got dominated by what we did on the U.S. side, largely driven by the $1.5 billion. If you take that $1.5 billion away, and you look at what we\u2019ve done, we were at $1.6 billion, of which the European -- the international business represented, I would say, trying to do a quick math right around 30%. So -- and that\u2019s generally been where the international business has contributed. But look, I\u2019m very excited about that business, and there\u2019s more to come. Wes Golladay : Okay. It sounds good. And yes, good job, Neil. That\u2019s actually good volume once adjusted. I guess next question is more bigger picture. I\u2019m kind of curious what your opinion would be, what is the bigger risk to net lease? Would it be inflation and potentially having this price escalators, would it be tenant credit at this point of the cycle? Sumit Roy : I would think it\u2019s tenant credit. You\u2019ll have to look at all of the various different net lease businesses and take a view on where do you see the credit risk largely driven by these inflationary pressures, the persistence of those inflationary pressures which then obviously is resulting in this higher interest rate environment. I think that\u2019s going to sort of filter through and it will impact net lease businesses, net lease companies differently, depending on the makeup of where their exposure lies. For me, one of the advantages that we have is, do we -- can we perfectly match inflation with -- of the inherent growth rates that we have, we can\u2019t. So there\u2019s always going to be a bit of a mismatch. But have we, and now I\u2019m talking about Realty Income, done a much better job of growing the inherent growth profile of our leases? The answer is a categorical yes. Today -- and I think it was part of my prepared remarks, our overall portfolio, if you were to do nothing, will grow by 1.5% and on a levered basis closer to 2%. Some of it is actually benefited from non-capped CPIs that we\u2019ve been able to get on one-third of the assets that have CPI growth rates built into them in the international markets. And those have contributed greatly to increasing our inherent growth rate. So, it\u2019s never going to be perfectly matched, but the risk of not having a perfectly matched growth rate inherent in your leases is somewhat muted versus credit risks that could translate into much bigger impact on your overall business. Operator : The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Just two quick ones. Staying on the tenant credit risk. So, I see occupancy 99%; median EBITDA, it looks like it ticked up 2.8% versus 2.7% last quarter. And I know that\u2019s reported with a lag, but still pretty interesting. And I think in your opening comments, you mentioned that basically the watch list was the lowest sort of ever. So things are certainly feeling pretty good. But as you sort of look forward, when you hear stuff like student loans starting again for property insurance in Florida. Just sort of curious, how does your team sort of stress test that or think about that, what the potential impact did it have on the tenant side? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Yes. Good question, Ronald. And just to clarify, it wasn\u2019t the last five years that I said that our credit watch list is in the 3s. It\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been in the last five years. Those are very good questions. what is it when student loans get instituted back again and discretionary income falls? What are the first things to go? It\u2019s going to be discretionary spend, right? And if you look at the portfolio that we\u2019ve created that largely consist of nondiscretionary, low-price point, service-oriented businesses, these are things that will be the last to go. Could they be impacted? Of course, they can. But when you have discretionary income that is getting compressed, those are not going to be the types of businesses that will get impacted first. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve constituted our portfolio of assets is being very much focused on what are the industries that are going to be a lot more resilient under economic conditions like the one that we are facing today. So, it is not by luck that we find ourselves with a credit watch list that is circa 3.7%. It is by design. And that\u2019s how we run our business, Ronald. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my second one was just -- so going back to guidance a little bit and taking a step back thinking about this year, just can you -- what are the big two or three sort of comp issues that the guidance was facing this year? I think you hit on one, which is the interest cost sort of headwind, right, for this year. But presumably, that\u2019s not going to be an issue for \u201824 because the comp just is not as tough. But was there anything else sort of onetimey or unique to this year, it could be property tax, it could be whatever that we should be mindful of, for \u201823 that maybe does not sort of happen again in \u201824? Jonathan Pong : Hey Ron, it\u2019s Jonathan. I\u2019ll say -- I\u2019ll expand on what I said earlier regarding short-term rates. We talked about the impact to the back half of this year. But when you really zoom out and you look at year-over-year versus all of 2022 versus 2023, it\u2019s even a greater impact. It\u2019s closer to $0.07 or $0.08, which based off the midpoint of our guide is about 2%. And so, you take that out and on a normalized basis, the volume that we\u2019re doing, everything that we\u2019re doing from a portfolio and asset management standpoint, we\u2019re trending closer to a 5% number year-over-year if you were at 3.1% this quarter. The first quarter did have a little bit of a tougher comp, if you recall the first quarter of 2022. We did have a significant reserve reversal in the other industry. So that\u2019s why the first quarter was a little bit flat. Second quarter outside of rates is getting back more towards a normalized level. So, back half of the year, I think you\u2019ll continue to see some difficult comps on the SOFR front. And given that we do have even an 8%, 10% exposure to variable rates, just given the magnitude of the move, that\u2019s going to be the biggest difference. Operator : The next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Just going back to your comment regarding the stickiness of cap rates, the investment spread of 133 basis points. How does that vary between international and domestic investments? And where would you see investment spreads in those two categories trending? Sumit Roy : Yes. If you actually follow the headline cap rates that we are registering, I think the international business was 20 basis points higher. So, that should answer your question, Linda. But, again, this is going to be very much a product-by-product opportunity-by-opportunity discussion in terms of what is the actual spread that we are going to realize, and is there an advantage between the domestic markets and the international markets. I think the advantages are very different. Here in the U.S. market, there\u2019s clearly more competition, there are more players. In the international markets, we don\u2019t experience that. The U.S. market, however, is a much more mature sale-leaseback market. And so there are more opportunities that one can participate in, whereas I would say the international market is still in the nascent stages of sale-leaseback as a viable product. It is maturing, but it is behind the curve. And for us, what we want to try to do is position ourselves in both these markets and work from our points of strength that allows us to then win transactions. Our average has been 150 basis points of spread from the time we\u2019ve been tracking spreads. And first quarter, it was 200 basis points, based on realized capital that we raised to actually help finance our business. This quarter, based on, again, the same method, it\u2019s 133 basis points. So, if you average out year-to-date, it\u2019s still north of what our 150 basis points historical average has been. But it\u2019s very difficult, Linda to tell you, going forward, you\u2019re going to have one geography that is going to dominate the spread versus another. It\u2019s very much opportunity-driven. Linda Tsai : Got it. And then I think you said 30% of your international leases have uncapped CPI. What is the nature of those tenants that are open to that versus the other 70% of leases that don\u2019t have uncapped? Sumit Roy : Yes. Linda, let me be a bit more precise. Of the international leases that have CPI as the driver of internal growth, one third or 30% of them are uncapped. So not all of our leases in the international markets have CPI drivers of internal growth. So, I just want to make that clarification. And again, it is very much a function of the market. A market that is used to seeing CPI growth as the metric for -- in their leases, they\u2019re far more receptive to continuing to see that. Now there has been some pushback given just the sheer magnitude of inflation that\u2019s being experienced in some of these markets, and we are trying to be commercial about that. But, it\u2019s very difficult suddenly to go to a client here who happens to be an investment-grade client and say, \"Sorry, we want CPI growth\", you\u2019re not going to get that. So yes, we see -- we tend to see more uncapped CPI growth in the international markets than we do here. And yes, but that too is evolving. Operator : The next question comes from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street. Harsh Hemnani : Sumit, you mentioned that in the past, sourcing, what you close is roughly 7% of what you\u2019ve sourced. And this quarter, it was closer to 15%. Do you worry at all of the net lease transaction market sort of continues to remain illiquid and at Realty Income, you\u2019re closing $5 billion to $7 billion annually, that you might not have the luxury to be as selective as you were in the past and maybe you have to execute on your second or third best idea. How are you thinking about that looking over the next 12 months? Sumit Roy : Well, the good news, Harsh, is that we haven\u2019t gone to executing on our second or third best ideas yet. We\u2019re very fortunate. Let me shed some light on this 15% closing rather than what we\u2019ve traditionally done, which is the 7% to 10%. What is skewing this is clearly the $1.5 billion transaction that we closed on in the second quarter, but it\u2019s not reflected in the denominator in the sourcing volume of $15 billion. We had sourced that asset, I would say, probably in the fourth quarter of last year. So, that\u2019s where the mismatch occurs. In some ways the sourcing volume is much more real time, what did we see. And there is generally a lag between when we engage in a conversation, i.e., when it is sourced versus when does that particular transaction get over the finish line or closes. And I think that lag sometimes does create this mismatch. So, if we were to sort of take away the $1.5 billion and then look at the $1.6 billion that we ended up closing in a year that -- in a quarter where we source $15 billion, $16 billion, that\u2019s still 10%. So, I think that\u2019s probably the way to think about this mismatch that we saw in the second quarter. Harsh Hemnani : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the $1.6 trillion that you provided that there\u2019s $1.6 trillion of commercial real estate on S&P 500 company balance sheet. How much of that is real estate that you would actually want to have in your portfolio? So, I imagine you\u2019re not actively acquiring office assets. Could you share how much of that is maybe retail gaming, et cetera, that you might go after? Sumit Roy : Yes. That\u2019s a great question, Harsh, and we did that when we talk about $4 trillion here in the U.S. and $8 trillion in Europe. And just to be also super clear about this particular statistics that we shared in the prepared remarks. It does not include other real estate companies. It does not include certain sectors like finance companies, banks, energy companies, et cetera, et cetera. These are operating businesses that have assets. And an easy way to think about it is, let\u2019s assume that half of it is office. Let\u2019s assume that another 20% of it is something that we wouldn\u2019t want. Even if it is 20% or 30% of this $1.6 trillion, that is a massive number. And the point is that these are companies that are going to have to refinance their debt, this $1.2 trillion of debt over the next three years. It\u2019s maturing over the next 3 years. And sale-leaseback should be a conversation that is appealing to them, especially given the cost of doing a sale-leaseback today in this environment versus the cost of refinancing that a lot of these companies are going to experience. That\u2019s really the point. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing many of you at the various conferences this fall. Have a good rest of your summer. Bye, bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We\u2019ll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Tyler, and welcome, everyone. We are proud of the solid execution we've delivered on our strategy in the third quarter and maintain a favorable outlook for our business. Our One Team at Realty Income continues to work diligently toward delivering strong results to our clients and stakeholders. The resilience, tenacity and range of our One Team has been impressive, culminating in the signing of the merger agreement with Spirit Realty, which we announced last week. This followed a quarter in which we invested $2 billion in high-quality acquisitions, raised over $2 billion in long-term and permanent capital, re-leased 284 properties at a 106.9% recapture rate, supporting an increase to our 2023 AFFO per share guidance range, which now stands at $3.98 to $4.01. I would like to thank our One Team for their leadership efforts and dedication on behalf of all of whom we serve. Our third quarter results demonstrate the consistency of our earnings profile through varying economic environments and the attractive internal growth of our high-quality real estate portfolio, while highlighting the capabilities of our One Team and platform. Notwithstanding the challenging capital markets backdrop, AFFO per share grew 4.1% from last year to $1.02 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered an annualized total operational return up approximately 9%. As announced last week, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Spirit Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $9.3 billion. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share on a leverage-neutral basis without requiring any external capital to fund the merger. The accretion from the transaction once completed creates the foundation for AFFO per share growth in the coming year and puts us in a unique situation where we've had good visibility to an attractive forward earnings growth rate potential two months prior to the start of the new year. Given that that of course remains a fair amount of uncertainty in the capital markets environment, the accretion from the Spirit transaction is made more compelling given the lack of capital markets risk we are absorbing to effectuate this outcome. In fact, we believe our conservative underwriting of the portfolio provides for meaningful upside potential to our headline accretion expectations. We believe Spirit's portfolio is complementary to ours and we help to further diversify our industry, client and property concentrations. We expect our increased size diversification, trading liquidity and overall presence in the market will enable us to access the capital markets even more efficiently, while also improving our ability to digest larger deals without creating concentration issues within our portfolio. We are excited about the attractive cost basis, earnings accretion and enhanced ability to buy in bulk that will be effectuated through this transaction. I would like to express great appreciation for the Spirit and Realty Income teams, given their hard work and collaboration, which enabled us to successfully progress the transaction. In the third quarter, we invested approximately $2 billion in high-quality real estate investments, leased to a diversified group of clients at a 6.9% initial cash yield. $1.4 billion of this total was derived from the international business at a 6.9% yield. Investments in the quarter were made across 132 discrete transactions. I would highlight that our volume include 34 sale-leaseback transactions for $1.3 billion of volume and six deals that were greater than $50 million in size. This demonstrates that both the corporate sale leaseback and larger transaction initiatives remained advantageous for us during the quarter. A testament to our ability to source, negotiate and close on transactions that are less trafficked amongst other net lease companies both public and private. Our investment activity year-to-date is $6.8 billion, with investments in international markets representing approximately one-third of this total. Investment spreads realized during the quarter were over 100 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis and using the cost of equity and debt actually executed during the quarter. This is a decline of 30 basis points from last quarter, which is a result of the significant increase in the cost of capital \u2013 felt across the capital markets in a short amount of time. To put it into context, the average 10-year yield increased by approximately 55 basis points from Q2 to Q3. Following the sharp changes in the public debt and equity markets during the quarter, the private market cap rates have not adequately adjusted. Accordingly, we believe that it is particularly important to be disciplined and patient allocators of capital and ensuring that we are appropriately compensated for the capital we provide. We are confident in our ability to source and allocate capital and scale and with efficiency and we are deeply focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. Given the level of transactions completed in the first three quarters of the year, combined with an outlook for narrowed investment spreads, we are modestly increasing our investment guidance to approximately $9 billion for 2023, which excludes the Spirit transaction that is anticipated to close in 2024. This increased target reflects deals that we already had in the closing pipeline prior to the recent surge in our cost of capital. With the sharp recent changes in cost of capital, we remain highly selective in pursuing new investment opportunities and will assertively hold the line on entering into any new transactions unless we can be assured of generating ample spreads to our cost of capital. From an operating perspective, our portfolio continues to be healthy and performed well. At the end of the quarter occupancy was 98.8%. This is down slightly from last quarter's historically high occupancy level of 99% and it is a result of expected client move-outs. Rent recapture rates across 284 new and renewed leases was 106.9%. This outcome is better than our historical average of 102.3% and results in year-to-date rent recapture of 104.3% on 661 new and renewed leases. I would highlight that since 1996 we have managed over 5,300 lease expirations. And the improving recapture rates in recent years is a testament to our asset management expertise and the unparalleled historical data we have at our disposal. This competitive advantage enhances the quality of our asset management decisions through unique insights gleaned from our proprietary data analytics platform. Our credit watchlist represents 2.5% of our annualized base rent as of the end of the quarter. This is a decline of 120 basis points from the second quarter and is primarily the result of removing Cineworld from the watch list following our amendment, which became effective on October 1. We recovered 60% of prior base rent on our 41 locations without any capital contributions. Importantly we also negotiated the ability to recover rent through percentage rent agreements which could give us the ability to recapture a total of 70% of prior rent based on our internal estimates of performance. Finally with the reinvestment of certain asset sales we expect to recapture a total of approximately 85% of prior rent. Same-store rent grew at an elevated rate of 2.2%. We continue to generate increasing higher average rent escalators within the portfolio due to our commitment to investing in leases with stronger rent escalators, particularly, in international markets where we have a relatively outsized number of leases with uncapped inflation escalators. The better-than-expected same-store rent growth in the quarter has enabled us to raise our full year guidance to approximately 1.5%. With that I would like to turn the call over to Jonathan. Jonathan Pong : Thank you, Sumit. Discipline and a commitment to our A3/A minus- credit ratings continue to be our priorities from a balance sheet management perspective. During the third quarter our net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratios each fell by 10% to 5.2 times and 4.5 times, respectively. In the third quarter we issued $886 million of equity primarily through our ATM program while ending the quarter with $749 million of unsettled forward equity outstanding. Combined with cash on hand with $344 million, the net availability on our credit facility of $3.4 billion we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of liquidity. As we look forward to future capital raising needs we continue to have rate protection on $1 billion of notional value to hedge against a rising 10-year yield. We purchased this protection in the form of a derivative instrument called a swaption corridor, which effectively limits our rate exposure on a future note issuance at an option premium below the cost of a regular way vanilla option. We purchased this option in late March when a 10-year yield was in the 3.5% area. And as of quarter end the net value of the swaptions had a mark-to-market value of approximately $25 million. As Sumit mentioned previously, the Spirit transaction provides us with the opportunity for meaningful earnings accretion in the coming years. From a balance sheet perspective, the Spirit team has done a great job in curating a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, which limits our future refinancing risk in any given year. As we have experienced throughout the company's history, the global rate environment provides both headwinds and tailwinds in any given year, which is why the assumption of balance fixed rate debt stack that is spread fairly ratably from 2025 through 2032 and provides us with extended financial benefits with manageable refinancing risk. When giving effect to the combined debt maturity stack, we estimate that there will not be a year when more than 12% of our total fixed rate debt comes due. Similar to the complementary real estate portfolio, Spirits debt stack is also a good fit with our existing maturity schedule, and we expect the continued debt stack or the combined debt stack to remain well laddered giving us numerous opportunities to engage in opportunistic liability management exercises when -- and economically advantageous to do so. When I finally I would like to thank all of our team members who have worked so incredibly hard in helping to support this transaction, and we will continue to be integral as we move towards close and integration. With that, I would like to turn it back to Sumit. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. In conclusion as further demonstrated in the quarter, Realty Income has a well-established growth-focused business model that provides stable and predictable cash flows to fund the payout of our monthly dividend. We believe the platform we have created, evolved and refined is not easily replicable. We have a long history of prudently allocating capital that is complemented by our industry-leading capital leasing abilities that we used to invest across properties that fall within our well-defined investment criteria. The results of our efforts have produced our net lease portfolio that consists of more than 13,200 properties diversified across property types industries, geographies and clients. We're excited for the future of our business. Our anticipated acquisition of Spirit provides a solid building block for growth, as we head into 2024 and our existing portfolio continues to perform well. As such we find ourselves in a favorable position to produce high single or low double-digit operational returns, while offering the same stability that has defined this platform for decades. At this time we can open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe just going back to some of the opening remarks on the re-leasing the spreads. Just curious what drove that historically better than or the re-leasing spread is better than the historical run rate? And then just how should we think about that going forward? Sumit Roy : Yeah. Great question, Josh. A lot of this was driven by our non-retail re-leasings. And you can see the breakout I think we provide that in the supplemental, it was closer to 140% in terms of re-leasing spreads. It was also largely driven by this one very large industrial distribution center that we released to a new client. If you looked at just the retail side of the equation that was closer to 104% which is still slightly better than average. And I think a lot of this is really what I said in my opening remarks, the more assets we control the kind of conversations that we can enter into with our clients is a different one. One of the largest renewals was Circle K and where we looked at 100 of their assets and we're able to enter into long-term lease discussions at very favorable rates. And that is what makes this platform so unique. The fact that we do control so many assets for some of these clients, the discussion we can have where, if there is an asset that's not performing well we are more than willing to give them a rent haircut, but make that more than up across the portfolio and come up with a win-win situation for both parties. And again, it's all about size and scale, but I'd be remiss, if I don't compliment the asset management team, the predictive analytics team that continues to refine the models and give scores on each asset, which gives the asset management team the confidence to then go in and negotiate knowing that these are assets that are performing well and therefore warrant an increase. So I think it's a combination of all of those factors Joshua that we were able to realize 106.9% re-leasing spreads. Joshua Dennerlein : Appreciate that color. Maybe just stepping back, how do you think about like your strategy? Is it something you want to lean into or you can try to get assets that get better internal growth going forward? Just curious. Sumit Roy : Yeah. Obviously, what this is implying Josh is that, if there are assets that we believe based on some of the things that I just shared with you that we can do better than the current in-place rent. We are going to take a bit of a different stance and try to take control of those assets, especially if the existing client is looking for a rent haircut et cetera. Which obviously we may have a bit of a negative drag on occupancy levels, because we want to take control and despite our best efforts sometimes when you take control, there's a bit of a lag time between getting this new client into this building at that elevated rents. But for us, the bottom line is going to be about creating better economics on rent recapture and at a small expense on the occupancy side, if that's what's going to be needed to do that. So going forward, you will see us continue to push this strategy and continue to show to the market that we do have a differentiated asset management platform. Joshua Dennerlein : Got it. Thanks for the time. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Josh. Operator : The next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hey good afternoon. Maybe you could just talk about the current pipeline. What do the yields look like right now? And then also how big is the Spirit pipeline? What do those yields look like? Sumit Roy : Yes, I'm not going to speak to Spirit because it's not a transaction that we've closed on yet. So, I'll speak very much to the pipeline that we have made. And as you can tell we obviously have a very healthy pipeline. We just increased the acquisitions to approximately $9 billion, which is an increase from where we were at the end of the third quarter. And again these are very similar to what we showed you in the third quarter. If you look at some of the largest transactions we did they were with grocery operators in the UK, it was ASDA and Morrisons, both names that we like and we're able to get these very large transactions as I believe was close to a $900 million transaction. Morrisons slightly smaller closer to $170 million sale-leaseback. Both of these were sale-leasebacks and done purely on a negotiated basis. That type of transaction is what you're going to see when we get those over the finish line in the fourth quarter. Those are the types of transactions that we have in our pipeline today. Some of the comments I've made around cap rates moving but not moving commensurate with our cost of capital movement remains true. The other piece that I will overlay is the fact that some of these transactions that we have in our pipeline were created six to nine months ago. And so people may have questions, how come you were only able to get a 6.9% cash cap rate which by the way if you look at it on a straight-line basis it's almost 8.1% and just given the inherent growth in these leases and to make it equivalent to some of the other data that is shown by some of our peers. Has the growth profile that we are targeting but potentially is not reflective? Which was obviously shown in the spreads that we were able to recapture 105 basis points, which is about 30 basis points inside of what we did in the second quarter. And that goes to the point I'm making is that cap rates though adjusting are adjusting much, much more slowly than our cost of capital. And so this is a time where going forward we are going to be hyper selective. But the makeup of the fourth quarter will be very similar. You should see a movement in cap rates in the right direction, i.e. higher cap rates and more reflective of when these transactions were essentially came on to the pipeline which started to reflect the more rapid movement in our cost of capital. So, that's what you should see. It's obviously fairly healthy. But thankfully we've raised a fair amount of capital through the ATM et cetera already. Nate Crossett : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just one on the Bellagio I just wanted to ask like what is your appetite to do investments where you don't own the asset 100%. whether it's a JV or a loan? And is there anything in the pipeline that is a JV? Sumit Roy : Off the top of my head, outside of the Bellagio transaction, I don't believe we have a JV structure in the pipeline. Similar to the way we structured the Bellagio transaction, we do tend to have JVs with developers where they hold on to a small stake in the development while developing the assets, et cetera, but we generally tend to be the takeout on the back end. But I don't think Nate and correct me if I'm wrong, that you meant those types of JVs. You were talking about more permanent JV structures like the one that we've entered into with Bellagio. I don't believe we have one like that. There is one -- there are products out there by the way, that do lend themselves to this JV structure. There are asset classes that require a tremendous amount of capital, where we will be more than forthcoming about entering into a JV just given the sheer amount of capital required. But those are going to be very specific to a very specific asset type, and I would put casinos in that bucket and perhaps some other asset types that lends itself to this. But as of right now, we don't have other JVs that we've entered into. Nate Crossett : Okay. So like what are the other asset types like, would data centers be on that list? I'm just curious. Sumit Roy : Yes. Data centers is certainly an asset type that will require based on this influx of AI, et cetera. It's an asset type that will have a massive requirement in terms of capital. I could see, if we choose to go into that area, that's an area that JV-ing with an operator would make perfect sense. Nate Crossett : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Haendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess it's still good morning out there to you. So Sumit, I guess first question for you is on the composition of the transaction in the third quarter. The share of Europe was historically high. The high-grade share and cap rates, seemed low. Understanding there is a little bit of a lag at least on the cap rate. But I guess, I'm curious if you can help us square some of that and maybe perhaps offer any commentary or facts and figures that would help ease any concern regarding the quality of the assets you're buying? And if we should expect Europe to continue playing a greater role near term? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Sure. So you tell me, if buying Asda and Morrisons is diluting the quality of the asset pool at realty income handle. I think we've tried to answer this question before that, we do not target investment grade. What we are looking for are assets that we believe, are priced and have a profile of generating a return that is on a risk-adjusted basis, the right return profile. That is how we think about the world. And the fact that, we are able to enter into these negotiated transactions, with some of the best operators in UK. I think is something we are very comfortable doing. And the fact that they don't have a an investment-grade rating is not an issue for us given how we were able to price it, the fact that these are top quartile assets that we were able to get and have inherent growth profiles that will continue to pay dividend in years to come. So for us, it's looking at the entire investment in totality. To determine how much risk are we really taking on? What is the operator? Where are they in terms of positioning? How are they positioned within that particular sector? What is the actual real estate that we are getting? What is the performance of the four wall? I think those are the things that we focus on. And the fact that they turn out to be investment grade or not, is almost a byproduct of that analysis rather than something that we target. And I think I've said this before but thank you for asking the question. I'll keep repeating this. I believe we had about 20% of our investments this quarter that was investment grade. But again that could be in some quarters 40%, in some quarters it could even be less than that. And we will, of course, continue to share that information with you but a portfolio that on a straight-line basis generates north of 8% yield, I think is something that we are very proud of Haendel. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Certainly appreciate that. And maybe one follow-up perhaps for Jon, a question on the reserves. I think there's been about $11 million of reserve reversal year-to-date. Can you clarify what's assumed in the 4Q guide, which includes the Cineworld restructuring and if we should expect any reversals in 2024? Thanks. Jonathan Pong : No, nothing that you should expect for the fourth quarter, pretty much all of the reserve reversals that were significant have been taken as of the third quarter. You may have seen in our same-store rent growth slide in the supplement that we saw a bit of a bump in health and fitness and that was really related to one more regional client that we reserved or refers to reserve off of. As we look forward into 2024, nothing lumpy from that standpoint that would be on the radar as we think about just bad debt expense in general, modeling out the following year we always have some semblance of an unidentified reserve that we put in there just given our history. And we're obviously very conservative on that front. And I think we've said this before, but we've historically realized about a 25 basis point credit loss in the portfolio at any given year. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Assuming you used the term hyper selective in terms of how you're going to approach the next year, can you define what hyper selective means? And does that mean that you would only look at for opportunities greater than the 100 basis point of investment trends that you saw this quarter? Thanks. Sumit Roy : That's a great question, Michael. Look, I think if you look at where we are today and you look a year ahead in 2024, we believe that without having to rely on the equity capital markets, we'll be able to deliver approximately 4% to 5% AFFO per share growth. And that is a pretty powerful statement to make and that obviously assumes that the Spirit transaction closes either in the first month, either in January or in February. And with just the free cash flow that we are going to generate pro forma, which is going to be right around $800 million, some of the headwinds that we are going to experience in the refinancing, absorbing all of that to be able to sit here today and say that we could deliver that growth without having to raise $1 of equity. I think it's a very good place to be. And so when I said about being hyper selective, what has happened more recently is that the cost of capital has moved so dramatically, so quickly that the cap rates haven't had a chance to sort of adjust. And so we find ourselves in this \u2013 like I said in the second quarter, we had about 135 basis points of spread. And then in this quarter we have 105 basis points of spread. It's a tough environment to be in when we are entering into transactions six months, seven months in advance of closing a transaction and the cap rate environment \u2013 I mean the cost of capital environment changes and when you are permanently financing it, it sort of eats into what you had originally underwritten. That is what I meant when I said, we want to be hyper selective because we want to help drive the cap rates out to help accommodate for these unforeseen movements in the cost of capital. And so clearly the cap rates haven't adjusted as much and that's what I said that's what I mean when I say we want to be hyper selective. We want to wait for the cap rates to adjust to make sure that we can get the spreads that we have historically achieved. That was really the color behind that comment. Michael Goldsmith : That's really helpful. And then as I follow up, occupancy took a slight step back but still well above your guidance range. So can you just talk about what you're seeing in the market in terms of pushing rents versus occupancy and how you use that to drive or maximize revenue overall? Sumit Roy : Sure. That's a great follow-on question, Michael. So for us we are looking at a particular real estate through the lens of maximizing revenue. And the revenue maximization strategy by its very definition will mean that we are more than comfortable holding on to certain assets that are vacant for longer. If we have concluded that there is a use for that particular location and that it's not the very first client that comes in and gives us a rent proposal. But the kind of client that we are targeting and the client and a profile of rent that we are targeting that takes time. And so we are more than comfortable taking a little bit of a hit on the occupancy side to make sure that we get the best revenue optimization for that given location. And that's what you're going to see. That's the reason why even though we've been running the portfolio at 99% for the last three quarters, we have always maintained that our occupancy is going to be up slightly above 98%. Because that we believe is a natural state of occupancy for the business model that we are trying to run here. And look, where it makes sense, we will continue to sell assets vacant, if we believe that that is the most economically desirable outcome that holding on to those assets does have a cost and that just continues to drag into the return profile. So selling assets vacant is also a strategy that we will continue to implement. So I just don't want you to start thinking now in terms of, hey, there will be no more vacant asset sales. All of those options are available to us and we will pursue the one that generates the best revenue outcome. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern : Hi, everybody. Sumit, the European deal volume was a record this quarter after a period of time where it seemed like the region was maybe a bit slower to reflect the new reality. I'm wondering if Europe is back to competing for capital on sort of a heads-up basis with the US or if this was just a one-off where you happen to have two large deals get over the finish line at the same time? Sumit Roy : We've been talking about these two transactions for a while now, Brad. So, some of it's just taken a little bit longer to get this over the finish line. And some of it has been that cap rates do take a little bit longer to adjust in the international markets than they do here just because of the depth of the market here. You should continue to see a fair amount of product coming in from the international markets and that's reflected in our pipeline. But I always go back to when somebody asks at the beginning of the year where do you think you're going to end up? We always say that it's right around that 30% to 40% will be the international investments. And 60% to 70% will be the US And I think that is probably where we'll end up at the end of the year as well. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. And then can you talk broadly about the attractiveness of the different capital sources. The $750 million in unsettled equity isn't quite as much as I would have thought given you have the $3-plus billion to close by the end of the year. But I'm wondering if you're shifting to maybe a greater debt balance given where the relative costs of capital are. Jonathan Pong : Hey Brad, it's Jonathan. So, all options are available to us. Obviously, each one of them on a nominal or absolute basis isn't where we would want it to be. But I think the one thing to consider is we're always going to prioritize that 5.5 times leverage first and foremost. And so when you look at our equity costs, you compare it to our indicative cost of 10-year unsecured debt across all three currencies that we can operate in. There is a difference that isn't necessarily wider than usual but there is a bit of a gap but we aren't going to sacrifice the balance sheet we are going to lever up just to eke out a couple of extra 10th of a basis point of growth for next year. So you could expect us to be very predictable from that standpoint and by predictable, it's carrying a reasonable balance on the line in our CP program having 10% or so of variable rate debt outstanding at any point in time and being very prudent with laddering out our maturities on a go-forward basis. Brad Heffern : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please go ahead. Eric Wolfe : Hey. Thanks. With regard to the Cineworld agreement, can you talk about whether that helped your guidance relative to what you were forecasting before and remind us how much income you booked on Cineworld prior to October 1, just so we can understand the incremental impact for next year? Sumit Roy : Yeah. Everything that we've shared with you on Cineworld is obviously in the form of an agreement. So any impact that, it's going to have is reflected in the comments that we've made about next year and the fourth quarter of this year. Eric, I don't know if you're looking for anything more that we are not expecting to give you a surprise that because of the Cineworld transaction there's going to be a drag on anything that we've shared with you. That's already been absorbed and shared. It's reflected in the updated guidance that we have for 2023 and in the comments that I've made about what we expect to see happen in 2024. Eric Wolfe : And then in the second quarter so I guess not the third quarter but the second quarter you saw around $0.5 billion increase in financing receivables within other assets. Is that more a reflection of the type of deals that were done in that quarter or rents were on those deals relative to the market? Just wondering whether we should expect a similar jump in the third quarter and sort of the quarters going forward? Jonathan Pong : Hi, Eric. That's really driven by the accounting guidance where when you have sale-leaseback transactions and you look at the rent relative to market, the classification of that revenue goes into a different bucket it goes into other revenues and also the corresponding balance sheet impact also will show up there. So it's no different than any other regular way transaction we do it's just given the nature of it being a sale-leaseback deal with the purchase price accounting that's dictating some of the valuation associated, with the real estate versus the cash flow and that's why you see that as that bump. Eric Wolfe : Okay. Right. So any type of sale leaseback would create sort of more outsized impact on financing receivables versus another type of deal. I'm just understanding that correctly? Jonathan Pong : Yes. Eric Wolfe : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Wes Golladaywith Baird. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Hey, everyone. I'm just curious what are the clients saying right now? I assume, you're still the cheapest form of capital for them. Are they just looking to pause and to see where rates settle? Sumit Roy : Yes, this is an ongoing debate. The clients tend to think about the world 12 months ago and we are trying to get them to understand the world has changed dramatically. It is that stickiness that causes the cap rate movements to drag and that's no different today. What we are seeing, however is that, when there is pressure on the client i.e. there's a maturity that they have to deal with on the debt side or they have a pipeline that is helping drive their growth and they have to build out assets or operate assets. That's where we see a willingness to transact and accommodate the new cost of capital environment. But it depends on the client it depends on the sophistication of the client it depends on the need and the urgency that the client is experiencing at that point in time where these conversations are either fairly straightforward and easy or there's a bit of a delta between what they're expecting and hoping versus what we can deliver. Wes Golladay : Okay. Thanks for the time. Sumit Roy : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ron Kamdem : Hey, the first couple of quick ones. Just back on tenant health, I'm looking at the supplement in this I see rent coverage is 2.8. Just wondering, does the Cineworld transaction sort of -- is that going to hit that number next quarter? Number one. And then if you could just broadly talk about just what are you seeing in terms of tenant health in sort of sectors or areas where you're starting to see some softness or any areas that are outperforming? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Ron, so the Cineworld will not have an impact on the four-wall coverage, because we don't get store-specific on a quarter-by-quarter basis. That number that we share with you our own assets where we do have a fair amount of visibility with regards to four-wall coverage. So when we have assets that have a point in time disclosure, we generally don't try to include that, so no, it won't have an impact. With regards to what we are seeing that 2.8 to 2.9 has been a fairly consistent number over the last call it three quarters. And it was a bit surprising all of last year because the cost of capital has started moving and we were expecting there to be a little bit more noise and what we ended up learning through the processes even the reserves that we had created we had to sort of unwind to reflect that the clients were doing better than what we had expected. And that theme has sort of played out. There are certainly some bankruptcies in the casual dining side, on the franchisee side that they are such a small portion of our overall portfolio. I am talking single digit basis points that they don\u2019t have much of an impact on the overall portfolio, where by and large given the essential retail that we've targeted, those clients are doing well. Sorry? Ron Kamdem : Sorry about that. Go ahead. Sumit Roy : No, that was it, Ron. Ron Kamdem : Okay. Great. So just, I guess moving on to my second question. Just want to go back to one of the comments you made about sitting here and potentially getting 4% to 5% AFFO growth per share. Just to be clear, does that include the $1.8 billion of debt coming due next year? I think at a four or in change rate being refinanced? Or how are you thinking about the interest cost headwind in that number? Sumit Roy : Yes, it does. And I think it does. So that's definitely going to be a headwind and the way we are thinking about it is forecasting out what the forward curve looks like today, what we think we'll be able to refinance that $1.8 billion of debt and what's the negative impact running through the income statement and therefore to the AFFO per share. All of that's been taken into account. And the big caveat here is making sure that the Spirit transaction does close in January, February and that our portfolio as we've shown to you in the third quarter continues to perform the way we expected to. And just those two pieces, I do think will allow us to get to that 4% to 5% without having to really raise $1 of equity I keep going back to that because that is a very important component of 2024. Ron Kamdem : Great. Thanks, so much. Sumit Roy : Absolutely. Operator : The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi. What are your plans around assuming Spirit's term loan? And how is lender reception been? Jonathan Pong : Hey, Linda, we fully expect to assume Spirit's term loan they've got $1.1 billion outstanding with a delayed draw to get to $1.3 billion. And so it's obviously all swapped at a very attractive fixed rates for us. We have had some preliminary discussions with the lender group. The good news is that there's quite a bit of overlap with our lenders and their lenders and we've been very flattered by the reception so far from our banking orders. And so everything is going according to plan there. We'll be able to utilize those swaps that carry quite a bit of value and it fits nicely again into our maturity schedule. So everything is going fine there. Linda Tsai : And then in terms of the Spirit acquisition, what's the impact on Realty's credit ratings and how do fixed income investors or review [ph] view this transaction? Jonathan Pong : Yes. So Linda was a very favorable reaction and constructive feedback from the rating agencies both Moody's and S&P they came out and reaffirmed the A3 ratings stable outlooks. And so again, we talk about how this is a very complementary portfolio and balance sheet. I would say, if you look at the before and after for some of the key credit metrics and our bond covenants, it's essentially unmoved. And so from that standpoint it was at a very lease credit neutral and some could argue you would get positive given the additional scale that provides us. And so all good on the fixed income and rating agency side. Linda Tsai : Just one last one. How do you think about portfolio discounts broadly like the EG group deal? Do you think they'll persist in 2024 and beyond? Sumit Roy : I do Linda. And in fact the larger the transaction, the better discount you're going to get. We genuinely at least here at Realty Income. We believe that to be one of the core differentiators of realty income and anybody else in this space the ability to do these $1 billion transaction, $2 billion transactions and not have to worry about diversification. Obviously, you know of Jonathan and his team's ability to access capital. I mean, that's a big advantage for us. And even pre-Spirit we are probably the name that trades the most on an average daily basis and that too helps on the equity side of the equation. So I think setting aside the capital and people are more and more talking about our ability to access differentiated capital, they are approaching us with solutions that they're looking for that has multiple millions of dollars associated with it and even potentially billions of dollars associated with it. And so that's how we want to be viewed. And as soon as you start to have those discussions on a one-on-one basis, you have the ability to move cap rates a little bit more. You have the ability to construct leases that are a lot more favorable. And we've seen that -- we saw that on the transactions we just announced in the third quarter with ASDA and Morrison. We saw that on EG Group in the second quarter. We saw that on the gaming asset that we did in the fourth quarter of last year. These are all these $1 billion plus or close to $1 billion transactions. And that's where I think we will continue to shine. Linda Tsai : Thanks for the color. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in Los Angeles next week. Have a great afternoon. Bye-bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir. Steve Bakke : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-K. We'll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Our fourth quarter and 2023 full-year results demonstrate the unique platform value that Realty Income has built, which differentiates us as a real estate partner to the world's leading companies. During the year, we accomplished several milestones, which illustrate the benefits bestowed to us by our size, scale and relationships. First, we set an annual high in property level investment volume closing on over $9.5 billion in high-quality diversified investments across eight different countries and through 271 discrete transactions at a weighted average cash yield of 7.1%. The year was punctuated with a particularly active fourth quarter as we closed on $2.7 billion of investments at a weighted average cash yield of 7.6%. Our fourth quarter activity included a $527 million sale leaseback transaction with Decathlon, one of the world's leading investment-grade rated sporting goods retailers and included properties located in Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Despite a volatile capital markets environment, we achieved an investment spread of approximately 115 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 120 basis points in 2023. We were able to achieve these spreads without sacrificing our focus on the quality of real estate or security of cash flow, which is a testament to our experienced team and the merits that sophisticated sellers see in transacting with our platform. Second, during the year we established a presence in the data center sector through a build-to-suit development joint venture with Digital Realty. And we incubated new relationships with blue-chip partners such as Blackstone and the EG Group through large scale investments, including the $950 million investment for a 21.9% stake in the Bellagio and the $1.5 billion sale leaseback involving primarily Cumberland Farm convenience stores. Third, and in addition to the achievements noted above, we also announced the $9.3 billion merger with Spirit Realty Capital in an all-stock transaction in October, which closed subsequent to year-end on January 23. These accomplishments contributed to our 2023 AFFO per share of $4, representing an approximately 7% total operational return for the year, and importantly, together with the Spirit merger, set us up to deliver a compelling earnings growth backdrop in 2024. We believe that the close of the Spirit merger last month along with meaningful debt and equity capital raising activity completed at attractive prices in December and January that Jonathan will describe in more detail, leave us well-positioned to deliver robust growth in 2024. We here initiated an AFFO per share guidance range of $4.13 to $4.21 per share for 2024, which represents an annual growth rate of 4.3% at the midpoint. We believe we can achieve this growth rate without the selling of additional public equity. Inclusive of our dividend, this positions us to deliver a total operational return of more than 10% at the midpoint of the guidance range based on the trading price of our common stock as of February 20, 2024. In addition to the $9.3 billion Spirit merger, we're also providing 2024 acquisitions guidance of approximately $2 billion, which is expected to be fully funded via a combination of our portfolios internally generated cash flow now exceeding $800 million after dividend payments on an annualized basis, as well as approximately $605 million of unsettled ATM proceeds and our $3.7 billion of cash and unutilized availability on our revolving credit facility as of year-end. While we continue to source and review high-quality investment opportunities, we remain highly selective deploying capital only into attractive risk adjusted return opportunities that meet both our near-term and long-term investment spread requirements. Of our $2 billion initial investment volume forecast, approximately half is expected to come in the form of development financing, the vast majority of which is already identified. To reiterate, our favorable return profile in 2024 carries very little execution risk from an investment standpoint, allowing us the flexibility to remain patient, disciplined and opportunistic from a capital deployment standpoint. That said, as we demonstrated during the height of the pandemic, our platform affords us the opportunity to pivot quickly back into growth mode should market conditions change. While we intend to remain disciplined in our investments to ensure appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our investors, we continue to highlight why we are best positioned to capitalize on compelling opportunities over the long term. First, the opportunity to consolidate the fragmented net lease real estate market is vast. We estimate $14 trillion total addressable market in the U.S. and Europe across traditional net lease and emerging verticals like data centers and gaming. Second, we have firmly demonstrated our capabilities deploying capital, having invested $9 billion or more including public M&A in each of the last three years since exiting the pandemic year of 2020. Over this time, we have generated annualized AFFO per share growth of approximately 6% and we have provided a total operational return to stockholders of approximately 10% per year. Looking to 2024 and beyond, we are on track to achieve similar capital deployment and AFFO per share growth objectives this year. We are particularly energized by the prospect to participate meaningfully in verticals like data centers and gaming, where we are seeing opportunities to earn healthy initial yields with attractive contractual rent escalators. Third, the Spirit merger deepens our ability to access capital markets through increased trading volume in our publicly-listed stock, which has averaged more than $400 million of daily trading volume since the Spirit transaction was announced. This places us in the top 150 of S&P 500 companies and is more than 7x the net lease peer average over the same timeframe, leaving us even better situated to fund our business in a highly efficient and non-disruptive manner through our ATM equity program. Fourth, our real estate portfolio is becoming increasingly diversified over time and consists of properties leased to relationship clients representing some of the world's leading companies in their respective industries. Diversified exposure to these clients reinforces the stability of our platform and accordingly are growing monthly dividend payments. Finally, the power of our platform is a crucial differentiator as we leverage our expertise across ownership of over 15,400 properties globally, inclusive of the Spirit portfolio. Our experience managing over 5,900 lease outcomes since 1996 provides learnings that feed into analytic AI tools that provide actionable insights, enabling us to more accurately identify acquisition opportunities and to maximize the value of our existing holdings. Continuing with our key operational results from the fourth quarter, investment volume of approximately $2.7 billion was allocated to high-quality investments at a weighted average cash yield of approximately 7.6%. We completed $1.1 billion of total investment volume internationally at a weighted average cash yield of 7.8%. Investments were made across 119 distinct transactions, including 29 sale leaseback transactions equating to $884 million of volume. Our full year investment activity was $9.5 billion, of which 35% was derived internationally, serving as a testament to the value of our investment platform\u2019s global footprint. Included in fourth quarter volume was a loan we made to ASDA stores in the UK at a 10.9% yield. The loan is backed by ownership interests and properties containing grocery stores and supermarkets and was extended as part of a sale leaseback transaction with ASDA. In addition, fourth quarter volume included our previously announced $650 million of preferred equity investment in the Bellagio JV with Blackstone, which earns an 8.1% yield. Similar to the loan investment in ASDA, the Bellagio preferred equity investment was paired with investment in high-quality real estate. For both investments, our ability to offer a broadened suite of capital solutions to clients granted us access to high-quality net lease real estate investments at superior risk adjusted returns than we could have otherwise achieved. These transactions serve as templates for future sale leaseback transactions. Also in the fourth quarter, we made our initial investment in a data center development JV with Digital Realty. The initial $200 million investment represents an 80% equity investment in the venture and is expected to generate a 6.9% initial cash yield, 2% annual rent escalators and a long-term triple-net lease with an S&P 100 investment grade client upon completion. Turning to portfolio operations, same-store rent grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.9% for the year, benefiting in part from lower net bad debt expense compared to the prior year. On a normalized basis, our contractual rent growth approximates 1.5% on an annual basis based on the current composition of our portfolio. This amount is up over 50 basis points from just five years ago and is a result of an intentional push by our team to generate enhanced organic growth. We remain committed to walking this growth rate higher over time through our deliberate underwriting strategy. Our diligent asset management efforts led to a recapture rate of 103.6% during the quarter and 104.1% for the year excluding the impact of the Cineworld bankruptcy. At year-end, occupancy was 98.6%, a 20 basis point decline from the prior quarter as a result of expected client move outs. I will now turn it over to Jonathan who will add further color to the quarter. Jonathan Pong : Thank you, Sumit. We completed an active quarter in the capital markets during the fourth quarter raising $1.6 billion of equity at a weighted average price of $56.25. Including activity subsequent to year-end, we currently have approximately $605 million of outstanding forward equity available to finance a portion of our equity needs in 2024. When combined with over $800 million of annual free cash flow available to us following the Spirit merger, we have the ability to finance all of our equity needs for our $2 billion investments guidance without having to tap into the public equity markets for the remainder of 2024. And this is before any capital recycling opportunities throughout the sales, which we expect to be north of the $116 million volume we achieved in 2023. As Sumit mentioned earlier, our AFFO per share guidance midpoint implies 4.3% annual growth and assumes only $2 million of investments volume, with almost half are re-accounted for in our development pipeline. From a debt capital market standpoint, we de-risked our 2024 maturity schedule through approximately $2.2 billion of bond issuance activity in a 45-day span, beginning with our GBP 750 million sterling notes offering in December and culminating in our US$1.25 billion offering that closed last month. Combined, the two offerings blend to a weighted average tenure of approximately 10.2 years and weighted average yield to maturity of approximately 5.5%. Near-term, these two offerings allow us to fund our business given our current investment outlook without needing to tap into the debt capital markets in 2024, which we believe was a prudent approach given the persistent instability that has permeated the capital markets over the last two years. There are also longer term strategic considerations that dictated this approach. Following our debut euro offerings in the summer of 2023, we believe these offerings also support our steadfast desire to maintain investor diversification across our multi currency debt complex, while pocketing future debt repayment risk in years with meaningful capacity. Last month, we also exercised the first of two one-year extension options available to us on our $1.1 billion multi currency term loan that we established in January of 2023. In conjunction with the extension, we entered into a two-year floating to fixed interest rate swap that effectively locked in a fixed rate of approximately 4.85% on this principle through its maturity date in January 2026. In conjunction with the closing of the Spirit merger, we also assumed $1.3 billion of term loan debt from Spirit, as well as $1.3 billion in existing floating to fixed interest rate swaps, which resulted in an effective weighted average fixed rate of 3.9% on that debt. Of this term loan principal, $800 million matures in 2025 and $500 million matures in 2027. Moving on to key credit metrics at year end, we finished the year with net debt to annualized pro form EBITDA of 5.5x, in line with our targeted leverage ratio and this excludes the $605 million of outstanding forward equity we currently have available to us. Our fixed charge coverage finished the year at 4.7x, which was the high watermark for us in 2023, benefiting from higher investment yields in the fourth quarter and less and lower cost short-term borrowings outstanding. In 2024, we do anticipate an increase of $45 million in annualized non-cash interest expense we expect to recognize from the amortization of below market debt on the Spirit debt we assumed. Note that this non-cash interest expense adjustment does lower annual FFO per share run rate by approximately $0.05 per share, but is not reflected in AFFO, thus explaining the primary reason why our initial FFO and AFFO guidance ranges are more closely bound than in 2023. We would note that purchase price accounting adjustments are ongoing for the merger and thus straight line rents and FAS 141 adjustments from the merger are likely to push FFO higher once finalized, and we will adjust our FFO guidance at that time. Of course, these are non-cash adjustments that do not impact AFFO. Looking forward, I would like to reiterate Sumit's opening comments about our lack of reliance on the capital markets to fund our growth in 2024. From a liquidity perspective, we view our near-term capital availability as a strength of following our bond yield last month, we had into the rest of 2024 with approximately $4 billion of liquidity at year-end, variable rate debt representing less than 5% of our total debt capital stack and no capital market execution risk to fund our growth for the remainder of 2024. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sumit for closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. Before concluding, I would like to extend my immense gratitude to Ron Merriman for his valued service to Realty Income on our Board of Directors the past 19 years. Ron's leadership, guidance and mentorship have been invaluable and we all owe him our sincere thanks. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to Jeff Jacobson, who will be joining our Board. I'm thrilled for all of us at Realty Income to benefit from Jeff's perspective as a former CEO of one of the world's premier global real estate asset management firms, LaSalle Investment Management and in his current role as the Chairman of the Board of Cadillac Fairview Corporation. In conclusion, our results in 2023 underscore the multiple avenues of growth at our disposal in the global commercial real estate industry, including through one-off and portfolio acquisitions, multiple asset types, corporate sale leasebacks, development and joint venture partnerships and via public M&A opportunities. The depth of our platform, team and relationships enable us to leverage some or all of these sourcing avenues concurrently as opportunities arise. In 2023, we completed five transactions greater than $500 million in size and two of which were greater than $1 billion excluding the Spirit merger. These are transactions that Realty Income was uniquely positioned to execute given our size, scale and access to capital globally. These distinct competitive advantages support us in serving as real estate partner to the world's leading companies at an unparalleled scale. Moreover, we believe that serving as capital provider to a diverse spectrum of clients, who are leaders in their respective industries, furthers our core mission to deliver dependable monthly dividends that grow over time. We will now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. First question is just on the acquisition guidance. You're starting the year with $2 billion of acquisitions. It sounds like you have visibility into half of them. Really like the execution risk for the year is only for $1 billion. What has to change in order for that number to kind of move higher through the year? Is it interest rates? Is it opportunities that come to you? Is it your ability to use to do deals kind of like what you've done with the Bellagio with preferred equity or with the loan with ASDA to get it done? Like, how should we think about the potential for upside for that number and that number moving higher through the year? Sumit Roy : Thank you for that question, Michael. It's a lot of what you just said. If you look at the market today and you look at the cap rate environment, the adjustments that we have seen has not been commensurate with the movement in the cost of capital. And we are coming out with a business plan that basically says, okay, these two variables that we don't control are not going to be part of how we deliver the 4.3% growth and north of 10% total return growth. And that's the reason for the numbers that we have shared with you. If the cap rates were to adjust, we will be first in line to take advantage of that. If the interest rate environments were to start to go down, which would then have an impact on our cost of capital, i.e., lower cost of capital, we would be first in line to react. We wanted to come out with a business plan that had no reliance on the capital markets on the funding side and come up with a number which we all believe very, very confidently that we will be able to meet, if not exceed. If the environment were to change, i.e., interest rate were to start to go down et cetera, which would have a positive impact on our cost of capital. Do believe that a lot of the conversations that we are having, so it's not the conversations that have dried up, it's the expectation in the market around what the reservation price needs to be that needs to move. And that can happen either through the movement of cap rates or through our cost of capital getting better. And right now, we feel very confident in saying the plan that we have has very little to no risk and we can deliver a 10% plus return without having to be aggressive in the market. And that's really the thesis around what we've come out with. Michael Goldsmith : No. That's helpful, Sumit. And then if we think about -- as my follow-up question, not to be -- we still have a lot to get through with '24. So this question isn't necessarily specific to '25, but just like the philosophy of if the environment stays kind of in a similar-ish range than where it is right now, where you just there isn't a lot of deals getting done. The transaction market remains kind of murky, you've driven. You've locked in growth for '24 through an acquisition. How would you think about -- how would you think about navigating through a multi -- a potentially multi-year kind of murky environment? Yes, exactly. How do you plan on navigating through a multi-year murky environment, if that was the case? Sumit Roy : So Michael, the reason I believe that cap rates haven't moved is because of the volatility in the market. If there was certainty that, hey, this cost of capital environment is going to remain at these elevated levels for the next three years, guess what? Cap rates will adjust, will move, and there will be more willingness on the part of the seller to transact today. We had the tenure at a 4.2 towards the end of last year, it dropped down to 3.75 in January, and then it's back up to 4.2. In that sort of environment, you have sellers that are saying, we expect the Fed to start cutting interest rate later in the year. I think it can hold off another six to seven months. So why transact in this environment today? And I think that's the reason why we have hesitation and lack of this widespread movement in cap rates that one would expect if people were to bind to the fact that this cost of capital environment has been permanently impaired. So I think in this scenario that you've sort of dictated, if that were to be the norm and if everybody were to accept that, that, hey, for the next three years, the cost of capital environment is not going to change, I do think transactions are going to come back. I do think cap rates will move much more than they have done so. And yes, we'll be the ones first in line to take advantage of that. Operator : And our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with BOA Merrill Lynch. Joshua Dennerlein : I appreciate the time. Just wanted to -- I had a question on the development funding. How do we think about the NOI from that development funding coming online? Do you only get NOI or return once the project is finished? Or do you get like a return as the money is kind of drawn down for that development? Jonathan Pong : Josh, this is Jonathan. One way to think about it because the answer is really going to vary depending on the lease. But if we're doing a development takeout, obviously, we put the funds down when the project is done, we get those assets and the rent starts and there's really no lag. If it's a development build-to-suit we're funding along the way. A little bit more nuance associated with that, where you're not quite getting the economics that we are entitled to as we put this funding out. However, from an accounting standpoint, the way that it flows through to the income statement is through essentially our cost of short-term debt. And so from a modeling perspective, the most clean way to do it, in my view, would be to just assume when you see us developing and deploying capital, that's when the yield begins because in most cases, that's going to be the case. Sumit Roy : Yes, the vast majority of the pipeline are takeouts, Josh. So this is really entering into a forward contract. We are not deploying capital as the assets being developed. And once it's developed and the certificate of occupancy is received, we are essentially buying the asset at that point. And obviously, rent is commencing at that point. So that's how one should think about the development pipeline. Joshua Dennerlein : And I appreciate all that color. Maybe one more on development. I guess just how do we think about development as kind of like when you look across like your appetite to acquire new assets, like how do you think about like development? Is this something you're going to lean into more? There are better yields on developments versus just straight-up acquisitions. Just kind of curious. Sumit Roy : Yes. It's just yet another tool that is available to us to drive growth, Josh. That's how we think about development. We have existing client relationships. They have aggressive plans of expansion. They come to us and they say, hey, we are working with this developer. Would you be interested in getting slightly higher yields than what the market would dictate if this asset were available today? And would you lend your balance sheet to help us expand? And that is part of how we are building out our development pipeline because the expectation is that the yield one can generate through development should be superior to what one could get in the transaction market if that asset were fully operational today. That was the thesis. Now obviously, you might see that some of the yields that we have posted on these developments were slightly lower than what we were able to get in the acquisitions market, and this is largely a function of how quickly the cost of capital environment changed and the adjustments that did take place on the cap rate side, but on the way down on the cost of capital side, this will also manifest itself as a positive to what the markets are going to be. So for instance, the types of transactions we are entering into today on the development side, we'll have -- will be reflective of the yield environment today. And if the cost of capital were to improve, let's say, a year from now to 1.5 years from now, when these assets get delivered, there will be a positive spread that you should see on the development yields versus the -- at that time, cap rates that are transacting in the market. So this is really yet another tool. This will never be a dominant part of our business, but it is certainly a tool that if we want to view ourselves as the real estate partners to leading operators. This is a tool that we want to also provide to our clients to help them grow their business. Joshua Dennerlein : Got it. And if I can sneak one more in. Sorry about that. Does your -- I know your guide is only $2 billion, but when you think about your broader pipeline, are there a lot of portfolio deals out there? Like bigger transactions out there? I know they take a while to close. Just kind of curious. Sumit Roy : So Josh, I think I tried to hint that on the last conversation when somebody asked about what are you seeing, what's driving the movement in the market. I can tell you that we are continuing to have a multitude of conversations with our clients, where there's a disconnect is what is the price at which they are willing to transact. And that's where the disconnect is. So it's not that suddenly we are not talking to our clients. We, in fact, one of our largest clients, we spoke with them a couple of weeks ago and where the conversation sort of ended was their expectation of cap rates versus what it is that we could -- what it is that we would need to be able to generate the kind of spreads that would allow us to do the transaction. And that's where -- that's the type of conversations we're having. And clearly, if you look at what we did last year, more than five transactions were above $500 million in size, two of which were above $1 billion in size. That's what we can deliver. That's what we can bring to the table. And that's what our clients need are big solutions to big problems. And so yes, when the spigots open and this reservation price is going to be met by our cost of capital, we will be able to take advantage of and build out our pipeline just like we did the last three years. Operator : And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Nate Crossett : Just one on the pipeline ex development. I'm just curious if you've closed on anything so far in Q1? And if so, what was the pricing on that? And then my second question is the occupancy guide was a bit below current levels. So maybe you can just give us a little color on that? And what's on the watch list right now that we should be tracking? Sumit Roy : Hi, Nate. So I'm not going to start giving you cap rates on assets that we have closed in the first quarter. Suffice it to say that there have been transactions that we have closed on in the first quarter. It is reflective of some of the comments that we've made. There has been movement in cap rates. You'll see that when we report our first quarter numbers, but the movement in cap rates is not as widespread as we would like to see. It's not reflective of the changes that have occurred in the cost of capital side. So -- but yes, our flow business is ongoing. And we are being a lot more selective about making sure that our spreads are not being compromised just to create volume. And we have the advantage of coming into this year with a business plan that allows us to do that. With regards to occupancy, we have mentioned that it's going to be above 98%. A lot of these were expected, at lease expiration, these were expected vacancies. And we have -- we generally tend to sort of guide to this low 98% occupancy. Part of what makes our business slightly different from perhaps what you see with the other -- with some of our other peers is we actually like to hold on to some of our vacant assets given the ability to reposition these assets and create more economic value. I know that for a long time over the last six quarters, we were hovering around that 99%, which was unusual for us. But we are very comfortable if we believe that we can generate more economic value which supersedes the holding cost of some of these vacant assets by repositioning it, et cetera, we are very comfortable doing so. So the way to think about how we run our business is the normalized level of occupancy should be in this 98.5% ZIP code. This 1.5% is vacancy that we need to be able to execute on the plans that I\u2019ve just laid out. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Sumit, can you talk about the relative attractiveness of Europe right now versus the U.S.? It seems like you don't think anything is all that attractive overall, but at least in Europe, you have the better cost of debt? Sumit Roy : Yes, that's a great question, Brad. I will tell you that even in Europe, the volume of transactions is a lot lower, again, because of this disconnect between buyers and sellers and what each requires to perpetuate a transaction. However, having said that, we are seeing pockets of opportunities, especially in the UK, where we feel like even in this environment, transactions can get done. And so that, along with the fact that at least in Europe, our cost of debt is significantly lower by 110, 120 basis points. We are continuing to look for opportunities. But the volume being low is not just unique to the U.S. It is across the geographies that we play in. Brad Heffern : And then, Jonathan, I thought there might be more of a reduction in G&A as a percent of revenue this year than what the guidance suggested just given the additional revenue from Spirit was coming with not much additional G&A. So is there anything else going on that's keeping that figure from declining more? Jonathan Pong : Brad, there\u2019s always going to be a fair amount of conservatism sitting here in mid-February on line items like that. We did have quite a bit of growth from a resource standpoint in the back half of 2023, you\u2019re going to see the full annualized effect of that. And it\u2019s still too early to tell on the synergies front with Spirit, what ultimately is going to be achievable, but in the first month or so less than that of ownership, everything is trending to better than we expected from a synergy standpoint. And as a reminder, on a cash basis, we expected $30 million of synergies off of a $40 million cash G&A load annualized. So we\u2019re hopeful, but look, we\u2019re trying to create a platform. We\u2019re trying to refine certain areas of the business, but we\u2019re really trying to resource with everything going on, all of our groups to create this moat, if you will, that can persist for a long time. So with that comes a little bit of investment in things like technology and in people. So that\u2019s really the driver of that. Operator : And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Good morning out there. I guess my first question is on the investment spreads here. I think you guys previously outlined expectations for a minimum of 200 basis point spread on new investments versus your cost of capital, which is well above, I guess, what you saw last year. So I guess I'm curious, one is the 200 basis points still kind of your minimum required spread? And if so, how do you achieve that today given where your cost of capital is -- appears to be somewhere in the 6s.? And if that requires using some of your free cash flow, how are you thinking about the required return for that portion of your capital as well? Sumit Roy : Haendel, thank you for your question. So a couple of points. I've heard a few comments around free cash flow. We are going to generate north of $800 million in free cash flow. If you think about our $2 billion of acquisition guidance, this represents 40% of the total volume. And on a leverage-neutral basis, this represents 60% of the total capital. So to be able to generate 200 basis points on free cash flow is actually you can do deals at 2% cap rates and still generate 200 basis points. But obviously, that's not how we think about our business. And by the way, the 200 basis points that we were able to achieve, I would say now about 3 years ago, 2.5 years ago, that was in an environment where our cost of capital was massively different than what it is today. And being able to generate 200 basis points was not that difficult. On average, from the time we've been tracking spreads, we have always said that the average spread has been 150 basis points. We also want to make it clear that there will be times like last year and the fourth quarter of last year and all of last year where we did 120 basis points, where when you build up a pipeline with a certain backdrop with regards to your cost of capital and the cap rates that you're entering into a contract in. And by the time you close, if your cost of capital environment changes and you're permanently financing it at that point in time, that's precisely what happened all of last year. We had a very robust pipeline and we were entering into contracts with the expectation of not necessarily 200 basis points, but certainly 150 basis points and sometimes well north of that. But by the time we actually permanently finance the transaction, the cost of capital environment was different. And just to make another point, if you actually look at the cost of permanent financing that we ultimately effectuated in 2023, what we locked in, in terms of spread was closer to 140 basis points. It was 136 basis points, I think. So much closer to the average that we have since we've been tracking this particular metric. But I just want to make sure that if the expectation is that in any transaction that we enter into, we're going to try to lock in 200 basis points. That's not how we think about pursuing transactions. We also use a bar build strategy where there might be transactions that are precisely the right investment for us. And if it only creates 100 basis points, we believe that on a risk-adjusted return basis, that is the right profile for that investment, we are comfortable doing that particular investment. But then we will always try to balance it with transactions that have a 200 basis point profile. But that volatility or that spectrum of spreads in this volatile environment is very difficult to predict, which is why we are -- we've come out with the plan that we have, which -- even in this environment, we can still deliver north of 10% without having to rely on the acquisition market. Haendel St. Juste: I appreciate that. I just want to be clear, it sounds like 200 basis points is not the absolute minimum that you're seeking, which I think is a little different for what I think we had talked about a few months ago. But my next question, I guess, is on what's embedded in the guide here regarding credit loss and the integration of the Spirit portfolio? Can you touch on that a little bit? Sumit Roy : The integration is going very well. We've closed on the transaction on the 23. We are still very excited about the portfolio we've absorbed. As part of this transaction, we've hired eight people from Spirit on a permanent basis. And we have seven people on a temporary basis that are helping us through the integration process over the next six to nine months. In terms of the actual portfolio itself, we have not been surprised by -- now that we control this asset and the portfolio of clients that we are exposed to, we have not been negatively surprised on any front. There have been some positive surprises in terms of resolutions to certain clients where the outcome has been slightly more positive. But I will caution and say that it is still too early to tell. And that is part of the reason why we were very conservative in our underwriting. And what we shared with the market, we felt very comfortable in terms of delivering. But we've also said that it was conservative, and there happens to be upside, which we hope plays out. And if that's the case, we will share that information with you down the road. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. But are you able to quantify within the guide for potential credit loss or any added color on that? Sumit Roy : What we can share with you, Haendel, is the range that we have shared with you accommodates for any level of credit loss that the Spirit portfolio and/or our portfolio would generate. Operator : And our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Spenser Allaway : Given the dearth of deal volume right now, especially compared to recent years, what is the highest and best use of time right now? So I know you have a massive portfolio but outside of routine asset management, I'm just curious at this quiet period, if you will, is a good opportunity to underwrite new geographies or property types? Sumit Roy : It's all of those things, Spenser. I mean -- I think you've been following us for a while. We are constantly looking for ways to grow our portfolio and we are constantly looking at non-traditional ways to growing our earnings. And that will continue to be a massive focus of ours in 2024. You're absolutely right, part of having to absorb an additional 2,000 assets with 400 new clients, not all new clients, but 400 clients coming from Spirit. There's going to be a fair amount of asset and capital recycling that we would like to also engage in and that is something that the team is very much focused on, trying to take advantage of the time that we have to focus on playing a little bit of defense rather than the offense. But having said all of that, I do believe that this acquisitions environment can change and can change very quickly. And so the rest of the team, the investment team continues to stay in front of the clients, continues to have conversations, continues to be creative about how we could potentially be a solution to our clients. And so despite the guidance of $2 billion, I can tell you there is going to be a lot of work, perhaps even more so this year than last year in terms of creating the right tools, creating the right efficiencies, all of the things that we've sort of had to put a little bit on the back burner given the robustness of the investment environment that we've had over the last three years. So I think all of that will manifest itself in a much more scalable business, and we'll be happy to share some of that as and when we put it to use and actually start to realize some of the scale benefits. Spenser Allaway : Okay. Great. And do you guys have a target date for when you'd like to get through the kind of the Spirit portfolio in terms of pegging some potential disposition candidates and things of that nature? Do you guys have a target date when you want to get to the portfolio? Sumit Roy : We are not waiting on a particular date. There\u2019s obviously a priority of assets that we have identified that we don\u2019t believe to be core to our overall portfolio. Those are already in the market. And then we are culling through the rest of the portfolio to continue to add to our capital recycling program for 2024. So there isn\u2019t a particular target date, but we\u2019ll be happy to share with you more on this front during the first quarter earnings when we\u2019ll have assumed control of this portfolio for about 2 months and 10 days. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to go back to something you mentioned in your opening remarks where you were talking about being able to put in more growth opportunities into your leases? I think you mentioned it's up 50 basis points versus five years ago. And as you speak to, I guess my question is, I'm wondering, does the quality or sort of the credit quality of the client vary by the ability to push through higher escalators? It sort of feels like the higher quality or higher credit would have more bargaining power on their side to resist those kinds of changes. But I'd just be interested in kind of if you could just maybe talk about that a little more. Sumit Roy : Sure. Smedes, your intuition is accurate. In the retail space here in the U.S., when you start to talk to investment-grade clients on the retail side, on retail boxes, that enter into long-term leases, et cetera, it is very difficult to get them to give you what one would consider to be market growth rates. And so it's the ones that tend to be BBB, BBB minus and sub-investment grade. Those are the clients that you can help drive internal growth. But let me be very clear that the 50 basis points of increase was not by going lower in the credit cycle on the retail side, but was expanding into other asset types which have a different growth profile than what retail assets do. So what were some of the steps that we took? We obviously went into industrial in a big way. Industrials tend to have, even with investment-grade clients. And at one point, I think virtually all of our clients were investment grade on the industrial side. That's no longer the case as we've matured as a company. But they too tended to give 2%, 2.5% growth. So that was one of the drivers of the change in the growth profile. The second was going into new asset types like data centers, like gaming. Those do also tend to have higher internal growth profile. And the biggest driver of all of this is really the international business where we do find a lot of growth even on the retail side with investment-grade clients. So you might recall that we had -- our first transaction was a $0.5 billion sale leaseback with one of the largest grocers in the UK, and that had a growth profile that far superseded the profile that one can get here in the U.S. So it's a combination of all of these factors, different asset types, international, which has allowed us to grow our internal growth from approximately 1% to approximately 1.5%, and that will continue to be a major focus of our business is to how do we take this profile and grow it by another 50 basis points, perhaps more so that this reliance on external acquisitions continues to be minimized. Smedes Rose : Okay. That's super helpful. And then I just wanted to quickly ask you. I think you kind of touched on this, but you said you're going to recycle capital, more than $160 million that you did in 2023. And that's just because you probably have sort of more non-core assets identified with the Spirit acquisition. So that would -- that's what's sort of taking that number up maybe relative to where it's been historically here? Sumit Roy : Yes. I think one of our comments was that you should expect to see a higher number than the $116 million that we accomplished in 2023. As to the actual number, we will be in a position to share that with you during our first quarter earnings call in May. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Borden with BMO Capital Markets. Eric Borden : I'm just curious if you could talk about the potential opportunities you're seeing today as it relates to the credit lending platform. And what are the different types of tenant credit in industries that you're targeting today? Sumit Roy : So Eric, the way we think about the credit business is how can we be a one-stop shop for our clients. Clients with whom we've done traditional sale-leaseback business, that have a need to continue to grow their real estate portfolio. And if there is a disconnect, which we kind of saw last year where what you could get in terms of a sale leaseback in terms of yields versus playing in a much more secured position on a balance sheet and yet get 300, maybe even more basis points of yield on investments, it's a win-win for us as well as for our clients. And they would much rather do business with somebody that they understand and that they have a relationship with, and we can offer more of these products to them and enhance the economics on our transactions. That's really what's going to drive the credit side of our business. Having said that, it's across the board. I think we've talked about doing a credit investment in the gaming side with Blackstone. We've talked about doing an investment on one of the largest grocers in the UK. Again, these are the types of examples that you should continue to see. But we are going to be very selective in terms of who we lend to, given that, that is not a core element of our business. Eric Borden : That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask one question on the free cash flow. On the $800 million plus of expected free cash flow for 2024, does that guidance include the potential income generated from holding cash in a money market account? Jonathan Pong : Eric, it includes everything. So in our AFFO guidance, first of all, all of those outcomes, if we're sitting on cash like we have been, where we're relentless and trying to get as much as we possibly can while it\u2019s there. That flows through to FFO. And then you have to deduct obviously, for the dividend, that in effect is the free cash flow. Operator : And our next question today comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : Can you just take us through some puts and takes regarding the high and low end of your AFFO per share guidance? Jonathan Pong : Linda, so on the low end at 413, it's a fairly draconian scenario. You almost have to believe that short-term rates are going to continue to push higher, which we have -- we don't have a crystal ball, but crazy things have happened. It also assumes that there's essentially a shutdown of acquisitions and so you can assume that the $2 billion is something significantly less than that. From the credit loss perspective, I think that's also something that we put in a very, very conservative number that we don't think is likely at all of happening, but it is something that is included from a bad debt perspective. There's also some certain cost elements, things like leasing commissions, things like property expenses that are not reimbursed in G&A. You always want to plan for some negative surprises there. And then in terms of the high end, it contemplates a scenario where the macro environment and the cost of capital environment improves, and we are able to do quite a bit more in terms of investment volume. It also suggests that spreads stay in that 150 and up range. Bad debt expense is something that is closer aligned to where we historically have been as a company, which has been close to 40 basis points of rent when you include the pandemic. Outside of the pandemic, we're probably closer to 25 basis points. And it probably would assume a better outcome for some identified credits that we have in the combined portfolio that naturally, we took a very, very draconian stance on as we're building up the base case for guidance. And it also assumes that the mix of our short-term rates, whether it's in euro commercial paper, whether it's in sterling denominated revolver borrowings or whether it's in USCP, which tends to comprise of every exposure, it assumes that the mix is tilted maybe a little bit more towards the European side. Right now, indicative ECP rates would be in the low 4% range. U.S. indicative rates would be in the mid-5s and then you have sterling at 6%, not on the CP side, but on the revolver side. So these are all the variables that have to hit on the low and high end in order for us to reach those scenarios. Linda Tsai : Really helpful. And then just my second question is in your pipeline right now, what percentage is domestic versus international? Sumit Roy : Well, we don't have -- it's unidentified on the non-development side, which was $1.2 billion. Some of it is identified, but a lot of it is discussions that we\u2019re having both here in the U.S. and in the international markets. And if you look at what we did last year, 35% of everything we did was in the international market, 65% was here locally. That could change because it is such a small number. Based on the discussions today, there could be a lot more on the international side than here, but it\u2019s too early to tell, Linda. If you look at the history, it\u2019s largely been in that 30% to 40% international and 70% to 60%, 60% to 70% U.S. And that\u2019s what we would expect under normalized situation. Operator : And our next question comes from Alec Feygin with Baird. Alec Feygin : So I have one on income taxes. So for the full year, the year-over-year increase in 2023 was about 15%. And the midpoint of guidance is implying about a 35% year-over-year increase in 2024. Can you provide some more color on what is driving that large increase in income taxes? Jonathan Pong : Alec, this is really a function of the international business. So the way that we're taxed on that income, it's primarily in the UK. First of all, as a U.S. domiciled company as the 100% owner of the UK, but we are subject to some withholding taxes there. Now what we've done to combat that is we have intercompany loan interest expense and other ways that we can lower taxable income, where the effective tax rate on that NOI is around 11%. But the growth that you see year-over-year is really just a function of the growing platform and portfolio that we have abroad, which is now north of $9 billion. So it shouldn't be a surprise that as the UK grows in particular, you see that line item for income tax start to increase year-over-year. It's something that we obviously take into account in our underwriting and investment committee. It's a factor, obviously, in our long-term IRR underwriting, which is really what dictates the investment decision in most cases. And so it's a known cost that is fully built in to this business model. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor conferences in the Spain. Thanks. Bye. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. Steve Bakke : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. You'll disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. Our results for the start of 2024 illustrate our focus on thoughtful, disciplined growth and continue to demonstrate the consistency of our global operating and acquisition platform. We believe our value proposition to investors is a simple one. Our demonstrated ability to generate consistent positive operational returns regardless of market volatility and economic environment. Our projected 2024 operational return profile of approximately 10%, which comprises an anticipated dividend yield close to 6% and AFFO per share growth of approximately 4.3%, assuming the midpoint of guidance is a validation of our value proposition. To summarize the results from the quarter, we would highlight several key takeaways. First, diversification. Diversification by geography, asset types and client relationships. We believe our business model is unique in the real estate sector as we have optionality to grow in different regions with investments in a multitude of real estate products where we see superior risk-adjusted returns. During the first quarter, we invested $598 million at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.8% across three property types : retail, industrial and data centers. Over half of this volume representing approximately $323 million was invested in Europe and the U.K. at an 8.2% initial weighted average cash yield. Investment volume in the U.S. was modest during the quarter. Of the $275 million of U.S. volume, which was invested at a 7.3% initial weighted average cash yield all but $16 million was invested in previously committed development takeouts. This quarter's bias towards international volume is a testament to the diversity of geographies we consider to allocate capital. To further elaborate, our investment volume during the quarter consisted of 87 discrete transactions with three transactions over $50 million, which speaks to the breadth of our platform. Our ultimate focus with any growth vertical or new region is to serve as a real estate partner to the world's leading companies and to ensure the investment outcome matches the consistent risk return profile of our investments, which have proven resilient over almost five decades as an operating company and three decades as a public company. Second, the health of our portfolio remains solid across all key operational metrics. We finished the quarter with occupancy of 98.6% consistent with the prior quarter and our projections. And we delivered another strong leasing quarter with rent recapture of 104.3% on the 198 leases that we renewed or re-leased during the quarter. At quarter end, our list of tenants on the credit watch list comprise approximately 5.2% of total portfolio annualized rent, which is in line with our historical average and with no individual client representing more than 1% of our total portfolio annualized rent. Consequently, we would highlight the diversification of our portfolio, which today consists of over 1,500 clients in all 50 states, the UK and six other countries in Western Europe, all of which helps insulate us from potential disruptive interest rate and credit events that could impact the durability of our cash flow. Finally, our balance sheet and access to capital continues to represent a major competitive advantage and affords us significant flexibility to fund our business without the need for external capital. After the Spirit merger closed in January, our annualized free cash flow available for investments is approximately $825 million. This provides us significant organic investment capacity to finance our growth plans without being required to tap into the debt or equity markets to meet current investment guidance. I would also note this also excludes any additional capacity generated by our disposition program, which I will discuss later. In spite of volatility in the capital markets, we posted a nominal first year investment spread of over 340 basis points in the first quarter, which is well above our historical spread of around 150 basis points. The primary driver of these outside spreads is the significant portion of investment volume funded to free cash flow, which by virtue of being a non-diluted source of capital, meaningfully reduces our nominal first year cost of capital. To be clear, our investment decisions remain based on our long-term weighted average cost of capital, which considers only our cost of stock for equity and long-term 10-year unsecured debt. This establishes the minimum return hurdle we seek to exceed across our aggregate investment activity. In all cases, our long-term WACC has exceeded our nominal first year cost of capital with respect to our transactions. This long-term oriented underwriting model is what drives our focus on acquiring high-quality real estate, leased to solid operators who are leaders in their respective industries, because we believe these opportunities have significantly lower residual risk -- value risk. In addition, to reach our longer-term growth hurdle rates, we are increasingly prioritizing meaningful contractual rent escalators in our leases with conservative rent coverage metrics that we believe will be even more resilient through a variety of economic cycles. In summary, activity in the transaction market remains uneven. Many potential sellers of real estate remain sidelined, given this uncertain interest rate environment, which is amplified by mixed inflation related data over the last six months. Sellers remain reluctant to transact and the breadth and depth of domestic investment opportunities have compressed as a result. However, as experienced in prior cycles, we remain optimistic that the market will provide more opportunities in the second half of the year as the economic outlook becomes clearer. Turning to portfolio operations. As previously mentioned, our recapture rate was 104.3%, contributing to same-store rent growth of 0.8% in the first quarter. Excluding the negative impact from our Sinovel theater portfolio, following the lease amendments finalized late last year, our same-store portfolio was up 1.4%, largely in line with the contractual rent growth embedded in our portfolio. One of our competitive advantages in the marketplace is our asset management and real estate operations functions, consisting of over 80 individuals who we believe are among the most talented in the industry. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have now resolved over 6,000 lease expirations at a blended rent recapture rate of 102.5%, which is a testament to our acquisition underwriting, quality of our real estate and the scale of our asset management and real estate operations teams. During the quarter, we sold 46 properties for total net proceeds of $95.6 million. Our recycling efforts are a function of a more active investment management initiative. Our active decision-making on dispositions is supported by our proprietary predictive analytics platform. In recent years, we have harnessed the collective contributions of our predictive analytics team, the credit underwriting group, and the fundamental input from our asset management group to inform our acquisition strategy. We believe the combined benefits of these three groups provide us a significant differentiation in the industry as a result of the quantum of data we have gathered across our portfolio over our long operational history. So now in addition to our acquisition program, we are using the data to more proactively manage the portfolio and guide our active disposition program. I will now turn it over to Jonathan, who will add further color to the quarter. Jonathan Pong : Thank you, Sumit. It's been a quiet start to the year on the capital markets front, following our January US dollar bond offering, which raised $1.25 billion in gross proceeds at a blended yield to maturity of approximately 5.14%. As introduced in our prior earnings call, our financing strategy for 2024 does not require incremental capital to finance our growth and acquisition needs. This continues to be the case at our current investment guidance. To that end, we had another quarter with a net debt and preferred equity, annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times, that's in line with our target ratio. During the quarter, we settled approximately $550 million of equity previously raised through our ATM program, and which was outstanding on a forward basis. This leaves us with approximately $63 million of outstanding equity available for future settlements. And when combined with approximately $825 million of annualized free cash flow available to us following the Spirit merger, and the disposition program that Sumit referenced, our $2 billion investment guidance for the year is one, we believe can be funded without having to tap the markets. Our debt maturity schedule for the remainder of the year is modest, with approximately $469 million of remaining maturities, excluding $342 million of short-term commercial paper and revolver borrowings and of cash. As always, we look to maintain significant financial flexibility to fund known and identified liquidity and with approximately $4 billion of total liquidity available to us and minimal variability debt exposure on the balance sheet, we believe we can refinance these maturities while still retaining significant liquidity headroom and keeping ydebt exposure well below 10% of our debt capital stack through the balance of the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sumit for closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. In summary, the year is off to a solid start that is in line with expectations. Our earnings growth profile for the balance of the year remains consistent with our outlook and earnings guidance we gave in February. The tempered pace of activity in the first quarter reflects our long-standing capital allocation discipline, and we will remain selective as cap rates adjust to the current rate environment. In the meantime, the levers we can exercise from an internal funding standpoint, in particular, free cash flow and capital recycling, allow us to continue investing at spreads well over 200 basis points on a leverage-neutral basis. Our approximately 4% AFFO per share projected growth rate, paired with our estimated annualized dividend yield of approximately 6% is why we believe our platform offers one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the S&P 500. With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hey, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just talk about the current pipeline what does pricing look like so far into 2Q? Where is the pipeline weighted? And I know it's this most sample size, but pretty attractive yields in Europe in the quarter. Is there anything to note there? Sumit Roy : Thanks, Nate. Good question. I think what you're seeing here in the U.S. is largely a confusion around where the rates are going. When will the rate cuts materialize and it's a function of what we've seen play out over the last six months in terms of mixed data that is causing this confusion. And the way it's manifesting in our space is this reluctance of sellers to transact at what is reflective of the cost of capital environment today. And so for us, this is one of the advantages we bring to the table is we play in multiple geographies. And we are seeing much better risk-adjusted return opportunities in Europe today, where the data has been a lot more consistent, and therefore, the ability to transact with potential sellers much more real. And that's kind of the reason why you've seen 54% of the volume manifest itself in Europe versus here in the US. And I suspect, because your question was very specific around the current pipeline and what we think will happen in the second quarter, I suspect it will be a similar slant to the results. But I do believe that the second half of the year, we should start to see a lot more transactions materialize. I know that the team is actually in conversations with multiple potential sellers, but the disconnect happens to be where that reservation price is for potential sellers. But we do believe that once the environment becomes a little clearer in terms of what's going to happen with rates and when will those potential rate cuts come to fruition, I think the transaction market in the US will catch up. Nate Crossett : Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask one on the tenant credit side. What's on the watchlist right now that we should be tracking and maybe you could speak to Red Lobster, specifically because that's been in the news recently Sumit Roy : Sure. So the ones that we currently have on our watchlist, Rite Aid, that represents about 31 basis points of rent. It's still going through bankruptcy. We are very hopeful that it will emerge from bankruptcy soon. But like I said, it's a very small portion of our overall portfolio. Joan is another one that was on our -- is on our watchlist. That represents 4 basis points of rent and our expectation is that all six leases are going to be assumed at 100% recapture, just given the way they're planning on emerging from bankruptcy. Every other name that's on our watchlist is sub-4% in terms of names that are currently in bankruptcy. So it's a -- it's obviously a very, very small portion of our overall watchlist. The ones that are not on -- not currently in bankruptcy but continue to garner a fair amount of interest here internally, is Red Lobster, the one that you just mentioned. We have about 216 leases. It represents 1.07% of our rent. The cash flow coverage that we have across all 216 assets is right around two times and 201 of these 216 leases happen to be part of a master lease. So I just wanted to frame our exposure to Red Lobster, before I go into some color around the name itself. I think of Red Lobster is -- it's a pretty strange story. They have 700 unique locations. They garner 14% of the casual seafood concept. That is a very hard thing to do. And the fact that they generate north of $2 billion in revenue, if you look at it on a per unit basis, that's just right around $3.5 million per unit. So it's not a top line issue, as much as it is an operations issue. They've gone through several changes in terms of ownership. Obviously, there have been several changes in terms of management. And this is a business that, in our opinion, hasn't been very well run. If you look at the balance sheet, is it a balance sheet issue at Red Lobster. In our opinion, it's not. They have $220 million of debt and this is really a question of, is there an operator out there that could come in and basically manage this business even to a reasonable level of margins. Today, I don't believe they're generating a whole lot of EBITDA. But having said that, our 200 assets has two times coverage. So that should tell you that we obviously have assets that are some of the best assets in their portfolio. And so if this can be operationally rightsized, we believe that this is a concept that should come out, and should survive and do quite well, given the footprint that they've been able to establish. So, that's our view. We are keeping a close eye on it. As far as rents are concerned, we've collected 100% of the rents due to us as of May. So, it's a wait and see, but it does happen to be on our watch list. Operator : The next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Hey Sumit. Are you able to provide more details on the active disposition program you're talking about maybe in terms of targeted volumes industries or how you're identifying assets for recycling? Sumit Roy : Sure. Good question, Greg. So, what we are hoping to achieve is circa $400 million to $500 million of asset dispositions this year. We can't be very precise around it because part of it is a function of the market. We expect that the occupied sales and the vacant asset sales is going to be approximately 50/50. Obviously, in the first quarter, it was disproportionately vacant asset sales. I think $82 million of the $96 million was vacant asset sales, $14 million were occupied. But what we are trying to do is intentionally get ahead of some of these assets that happen to be on our watch list. And not always is it being driven by a credit issue. It's -- sometimes it is purely a real estate issue that our asset management team has concluded, does not have a long-term position in our overall portfolio. And then there are certain trends that we are seeing that we want to try to get ahead of based on client conversations, et cetera, that is also going to allow us to be a lot more proactive and get ahead of situations, well in advance of it becoming an issue downstream. In terms of the actual concepts themselves, it is along the lines of what we have been selling. Some of it is automotive services. There are some drug stores that we believe are not part of the overall strategy. Some of it is going to be the Cineworld assets that, by the way, the sale process is going, I would say, ahead of what our expectations were. And then some that are perhaps not, like I said, core to what our overall strategy is on the discount store side as well that we want to try to get ahead of. So, those are the components that will make up what we want to try to get disposed of this year. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And is that $400 million to $500 million the kind of entirety of the program? Is that a first step? And then how are you thinking about as that compares to the level of acquisitions that you're targeting this year, what that might mean for growth in 2025? Sumit Roy : Look, we've got to execute our plan based on what we believe is the right portfolio that's going to take us into 2025 in a position of strength. We have grown our business through M&A. There have been two very large M&A deals done in the last two and a half, three years. We've been, I believe, very open about not all of those assets have been core to our long-term strategy. And so some of this is largely a function of trying to get back to that core portfolio. We have obviously underwritten the impact of 50% of circa $400 million to $500 million in dispositions being occupied assets. But what you'll find is some of these assets are actually being sold. Look at what we sold or -- and I know it wasn't a big number, but the occupied assets, we actually sold them at a 7% cap rate, cash cap rate and we are reinvesting it at 77%. So it is actually an accretive disposition strategy that we've been able to implement at least for the first quarter. So for us, it's about creating the portfolio that we want to go into 2025 and beyond with. And this is a program that will consistently be executed on going forward. When we are doing sale leasebacks, it's not an issue. When we're doing portfolio transactions on existing leases, not always do we get 100% of what we want. And so being a bit more proactive around culling the assets that is not core to our overall strategy upfront is something that I think we are going to be a lot more intentional about. But we feel very good about our ability to continue to grow despite the strategy in 2025 and beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Farrell [ph] on behalf of Josh. I was wondering if you could clarify how bad debt is currently trending. I know you made some comments on the watch list. And perhaps if that has changed at all in your outlook of how much bad debt is baked into guidance? Jonathan Pong : Hey, Farrell, on the bad debt number, so we did disclose in the earnings press release for Q1, it was about $1.4 million that we actually recognized. As we think about forward-looking guidance and downside scenarios. I think we've been pretty clear in the past that we've been extremely conservative. I think when you sit here today, it's early May, it's a long time to go before the end of the year -- it's not to say that there's any major concerns. I think you heard some talk about the watch list and it's a bunch of small little things that if everything when a yes, maybe could have some impact, but it's certainly not our expected scenario on that front. And so I think it's really a mix of spirits assets that we did acquire that we've always been a little bit more cautious on, and we'll continue to be cautious until we get further into the year. I think for us, we're always pretty conservative as it relates to bad debt expense, especially early in the year. And then finally, there's some identified credits that even more or coating on. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And second question about given the cap rates that you're seeing in Europe with coming off of acquisitions, has your thought process or thesis change when you're thinking about development and the yield you can get off that versus these straight-up acquisitions. Sumit Roy : No, it's a matter of timing, Farrell as the older vintage developments start to roll off, you'll start to notice that some of the newer developments that we've entered into are more reflective of the current cost of capital environment and therefore, the cash cap rate yields that we are expecting on that vintage should creep up. It's just that we entered into our development pipeline 12, 18 months ago. And some of those assets obviously were more reflective of the environment that we were in at that particular point in time. But even at a 7.2% cash cap yield, which is what our development is -- that closed in the first quarter yielded is still circa 150 basis points, 170 basis points of spread. So yes, it's not quite the 7.8% that we were able to achieve on the overall and certainly not 8.2% that we were able to achieve in Europe. But that -- I just wanted to make sure that you are aware that there is a bit of a lag on the development pipeline and the developments that we are entering into today is much more reflective of the environment today. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern : Yes, thanks. Hi everybody. Going back to the European cap rates, it really felt like that market has lagged the US for a long time in terms of recognizing the higher rate environment. I appreciate the outlook has been a bit more stable over there. But is there anything else that's changed in Europe that's now generating these attractive cap rates despite the cost of debt obviously being lower than the US. Sumit Roy : Yes, Brad, what the cost of debt is certainly lower in Mainland Europe. It's not lower in the UK. I would say trying on top of each other, John. Jonathan is nodding. So the big difference that we see and why potential sellers are willing to transact at the yields that we were able to realize, they're twofold. One, there are funds that have had redemption pressures where they need to monetize real estate, and they are more than willing to reflect what the current cost of capital environment is because they need the capital. And the second, which works really in our favor is the fact that we have established ourselves as the go-to buyer of these types of assets and recognizing that the surety of close, which is very important for these potential sellers is going to be met. And that reputation really does accrue to our benefit, when we are sort of having these conversations, and somebody requires capital near term, and we have the ability to close on these transactions as and when we agree on a particular price. I think it's those 2 factors that's allowing us to be very successful in the UK and in Europe, and is how it's playing out. Here, unfortunately, you don't have similar pressures. Yes, there could be operators that might be willing to transact. But if they have any ability to wait, which in the US, they have a lot more alternatives, they are sort of standing on the sidelines, waiting for the environment to improve for potential buyers to then be able to get the cap rates that they're willing to transact in. So I think that's how I would frame, why we are being successful. One of the reasons is obviously very idiosyncratic to us and the other is it's a reflection of the market. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then on Dollar Tree Family Dollar, can you remind us what the Family Dollar split is? And talk about any impact that you might have from the closures? Sumit Roy : Yes. Look, I don't think that the impact for us is going to be disproportionate. We have about 3% of our rent that is Dollar Tree, Family Dollar exposed to Dollar Tree, which obviously is the owner of Family Dollar. And I would say about 60%, circa 60% is Family Dollar and the rest of it is either Dollar Tree or the dual banners that they have. There's about, I want to say 3% of the 3.3%. So that's nine basis points of lease expirations over the next two years, 2.5 years that will materialize. So even if there are these closures and even if some of these assets are named on the closing list, our impact is basically nine basis points. And I can assure you that our asset management team is already working on resolutions given that it is part of the pipeline. Anything beyond that will potentially be closed and will remain dark. We are still going to collect rent. And let me tell you that the pressure on Family Dollar and Dollar Tree is going to be a lot more acute than it is on us to try to find a substitute to step in and take over these leases. And just episodically, there's a fair amount of interest in some of these locations that we've received just along the lines of some of the news that's out there about potential closings, et cetera that we feel pretty good about our ability to resolve the Family Dollar assets. The one thing I'll add, which may not be apparent, Family Dollar tends to be in urban areas and in much more densely populated areas than Dollar Tree or Dollar General. And so the attractiveness of those locations to alternative retail clients is a lot more, and that's borne out by the fact that we have received inbound. So for us, this is no different than learning well in advance that, hey, these particular leases are not going to get renewed and it gives us time to work on some of these leases well in advance of the actual lease expiration. So that's how I would frame it. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Katherine Grey [ph] on with Michael. Thanks for taking my questions. My first is, you touched on this a bit at the opening, but how are you thinking about -- if you could maybe just provide some more color, how you're thinking about the cost of free cash flow within the context of your investment spreads? Sumit Roy : Sure. That's a great question. For us, free cash flow is a massive advantage. The ability to raise $825 million of free cash flow post all obligations is essentially capital that we can use to invest across a variety of areas to accretively grow our earnings. Obviously, when we have free cash flow, we have to figure out what is the best use of that free cash flow. We could buy back our debt, we could buy back our stock, we could continue to invest accretively. And when we find that investing accretively is the best possible use of that capital -- that is a massive advantage. And in a year where we are highlighting the fact that we have $2 billion of acquisitions, and we hope we do better than that, but that's our current guidance. Being able to finance this business with $825 million of free cash flow, which is obviously non-dilutive in nature and grow our earnings is a massive advantage. That's how we think about our free cash flow. There is obviously opportunity cost associated with this. But the way we think about opportunity cost is what's the best use of this capital. And for us, even in this environment, given the platform that we have, and given the diversification benefits of being able to invest across multiple asset types, across multiple geographies, we are continuing to find accretive use of this particular cash flow. And I think, obviously, one of the other things that we do look at is what is the long-term overall return profile. And that is what we compare to our long-term WACC, which is our cost of equity, that 65% and our cost of debt that is 35%. And the cost of equity -- and by the way, we have a few pages on this in our investor deck. It's largely driven by the CAPM model and the dividend growth model. And I think we take the average of the two to come up with our cost effective long-term cost of equity and the long-term cost of debt and it's 65%, 35% weighted. And all of our investments need to meet that hurdle rate and exceed that hurdle rate for us to move forward. So that's really how we think about our cost of capital and how we specifically think about the free cash flow, which obviously we view as a massive advantage to us. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks so much for the color. And my second question is on the development piece. So do you expect to see an acceleration of yields for your development projects as we progress through 2024 or even into 2025? Sumit Roy : We do. Any new development that we are entering into, and I think somebody asked this question as well, we should -- it should be more reflective of the current cost of capital environment. And so as you know, a lot of these developments, they do have a bit of a lag time. And so what you're seeing close today is in that lower 7% ZIP code. But what you should see translate over the next few quarters is to see that cash cap rate continuing to trend much higher, reflecting the current cost of capital. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Thanks. First question relates to the Europe acquisitions in the quarter and the yields there. Can you talk a bit more about what kinds of embedded rent bumps are included in that? How much was maybe traditional net lease versus maybe multi-tenant assets? Because it looked like duration was a little bit on the shorter side. Sumit Roy : Yes. So a lot of these were retail parks. And let's talk a little bit about retail parks because there's a confusion when you say multi-tenanted, we think in terms of what -- how we define multi-tenanted here in the US. This is not like multi-tenanted here in the US. A lot of these are I would say 80% of them are Tier 1 or Tier 2 as we define them, clients that we are pursuing on a freestanding basis. And they happen to be located in a contiguous part. And each one of these units basically has a flow-through from rent to NOI, very similar to what you would find on a freestanding basis. So the growth in these leases, they tend to be shorter, anywhere between five to 10 years. And the growth in these leases could be open market reviews or they could have some of the larger boxes could have more of the regular way growth that we've seen that are tied to inflation, et cetera. But when we are underwriting these assets, we are looking at the composition of the tenants. We're looking at the flow through. We're looking at are these rents above or below market? We're looking at what the long-term profile of the return is going to be. And then we are comparing it to what are we getting these assets at day one in terms of the initial yield. And these assets have really done very well. And some of the numbers, a lot of the renewals come strong, these retail parks that we bought because the freestanding assets haven't gone through a renewal process yet. And the fact that they are very similar in nature to our overall portfolio of 104.3% that we were able to generate this quarter is a reflection of how we are underwriting each one of these retail parks. But that's where we are seeing the value. And the fact that we are now starting to consolidate and control swaps of retail parks across the UK is a massive advantage for us because the kind of conversations we can have with clients that we've obviously wanted to grow with is very different when we control major locations that they would like to continue to stay over the long duration. And I think that's how we are able to generate the value that we are able to generate. And we are doing it at a time point in time where should be told retail parks are starting to change. If you look at the vacancy that you have, it's circa 2%. If you look at the actual growth that we are being able to generate, it's much higher than what was traditionally achieved. And if you also look at the free rent concept that used to exist, we are being able to compress on that concept, just given the fact that we control so much more of retail parks. So this has been a great investment for us. And I just want to make sure that people realize that the flow-through is very similar to a stand-alone net lease business that we've traditionally been involved in. So I'm glad you asked the question, Anthony. Thank you. Anthony Paolone : Thanks for all the color. And then just my follow-up is more on the credit side. You spent a bunch of time on that. But can you give us any updated thoughts on AMC, both as it relates to how you're thinking about that credit as well as your specific assets with the box office being down a bunch this year? Sumit Roy : Yeah. So look, we've gone through one of them already with Cineworld. AMC represents about 1% of our rent. We have, I believe, 39 assets. AMC continues to be able to raise capital in the equity markets. And 2024 is not going to be a great year for the box office. We recognize that. It may be equivalent to last year, maybe it will be even a little bit less than last year given some of the disruptions that occurred in 2023. But the expectation is that 2025 will supersede 2023 and the quality of movie releases will be much higher in 2025 than in 2024. Is it possible that AMC goes through a BK process? Yes, it's absolutely possible. But I can tell you, our experience on Cineworld gives us a lot of confidence that the assets that we have and the resolutions that we've been able to achieve and the restructuring of the rent that was achieved is still going to create an outcome that is very acceptable to us. Tony, just to put things in perspective, our history, and we've had several bankruptcies in our history, our recapture rate has been north of 80%. And I believe if we were to do the full analysis, once we go full cycle on the Cineworld, it's going to be in that ZIP code. And it's not actually even better than that. given some of the resolutions that we are finding on the vacant asset sales that we had touched on last year on Cineworld. So, I believe AMC is going to be a similar story, but it is not trade comp that they're going to go through a BK process, we believe they have enough liquidity to certainly withstand this year and potentially most of next year as well. But if they were to go through a BK process, it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think it will allow them to restructure the debt, which I think continues to be a massive burden and they will emerge stronger for it. And we believe that, again, just like in the Cineworld situation, we have some of their better assets and we will do fairly well even if they were to go through the BK process. So, that's our thoughts on AMC. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. Sumit, you mentioned thoughtful and disciplined growth selective a few times about your prepared remarks, clearly suggesting that the activity will remain subdued as you push the more yield and quality, but you did leave the door open in capacity in the gas a little bit more compelling opportunities to emerge in the back half of the year. So, I guess I'm curious maybe some more thoughts on that and how you think about balancing the pace of investment versus your longer term earnings growth target if you'd be willing to push a bit more in the second half, even if that would make -- right opportunities came along? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Hi Haendel, I'm sorry, it was very difficult to hear you. But I think what you're asking for is, do we expect to accelerate the investments in the latter half of the year given what we are seeing today? And if I didn't quite get that, I apologize. But the answer is, look, we are not trying to look for a particular quantum of acquisitions or investments, we are allowing for the market to dictate how much we'll be able to achieve in a year, which is very uncertain. If you're asking for an opinion, I do believe that especially here in the U.S., the second half of the year, when there is a little bit more clarity in terms of where interest rates are going, et cetera, there will be more opportunities. And Haendel, if you look at what we've been able to achieve over the last few years, we tend to get more than our share of the volume, especially of the product that we are interested in pursuing. And so is it possible that the U.S. acquisition numbers for the remainder of the year is going to be higher than what we achieved in the first quarter, the answer is yes. We certainly do. Do we expect the European momentum to continue? The answer is, yes. Do we expect both these markets to accelerate? The answer is, yes. And I just want to caveat it that this is our opinion, and time will tell. But we feel fairly optimistic about the second half of the year. Haendel St. Juste : Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on Europe since we're talking about it here. I think you have close to $10 billion or so, plus or minus asset value there. So I guess I'm curious if there's any change or update on the thinking of a potential spin-off of that platform? Is it large or mature enough? And maybe when do you think that it could be ready to stand on its in? Thank you. Sumit Roy : That was a loaded question, Haendel, but thank you for asking. The number is, I believe, closer to $11 billion. Yes, if we were to spin that business out, it would be one of the largest REITs in the U.K. But that is absolutely not our intention today. We are very happy with having Europe as part of our overall platform precisely for the reasons that we talked about on this call regarding the first quarter. It allows us the opportunity to play in markets where we have the best risk-adjusted return profiles of investments. And therefore, all of that benefit accrues to our shareholders here in the U.S. And so that's how I'm going to leave it. Again, was this a grand design that we would grow up to $10 billion? No. It's again a function of the platform that we brought in, our cost of capital, our team and their ability to execute unlike any other teams and our ability to form the relationships as quickly as we did and now we consider the de facto net lease company in all of Europe. I mean, those are benefits that has taken us five years to establish. And now we feel like is the time for us to continue to harvest the benefits of establishing ourselves in Europe. So that's how I would answer it. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Given the opportunities that you've talked about in the better cap rates in Europe and kind of the thoughtfulness on the long-term weighted average cost of capital. How do additional data center and gaming investments look today on the U.S. side? Sumit Roy : Thank you for your question, Nick. Yes, I would say about 6% of our investments in the first quarter went towards the digital JV that we have formed. As you may recall, Nick, that is an asset that is being currently developed in Northern Virginia, in Loudoun County. And it won't be operational until the end of this year, the first phase, maybe -- actually, it's the first quarter of next year. And then there could be the second phase that gets kicked in. So as of right now, that is the only investment that we have on the data center side. There are other opportunities that we are looking at. We do have an investment that we will make, we will continue to make in Spain, that is also looking at a data center side that we believe is very well located, and there seems to be a lot of interest in that particular side. That will be our additional spend on the data center side, but that hasn't been substantial to date. But those are really the only two opportunities that we are looking at. We are obviously involved in multiple conversations with multiple operators to try to understand where the real opportunities are versus the optimism that continues to play out in this particular space. And we are hopeful that we can grow our high percent part of our portfolio in a meaningful way over the next few years. But as of right now, a lot of it is just in the initial stages of conversations with potential operators outside of the JV that we have with digital. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then just on the gaming side? Sumit Roy : On the gaming side, things continue to look interesting. We've obviously made two investments. It represents slightly north of 3% of our rents and we are in conversations with other opportunities, including potential development opportunities in large cities. There's a very long tail to some of these development opportunities. But we'll see how some of these conversations translate into actual transactions. But I will say that there was an interesting conversation we were having earlier this year, which has been kind of put on hold for right now that would be a continued growth of our gaming business, but it hasn't quite materialized yet. So we'll see how that plays out. Operator : The next question comes from Wes Golladay of Baird. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Hi, everyone. You highlighted all the levers you have to pull. And when you created last year was the credit investment platform. Can you give us an update on that? Sumit Roy : Yeah, Wes, we continue to look for opportunities on the credit investment side. But please keep in mind that one of the things that's dictating our investments in the credit side is to continue to strengthen relationships with either existing clients or to help facilitate sale leaseback with those existing clients. And if we want to be viewed as a real estate partner to some of the world's leading operators, part of being that partner is to provide capital through the traditional channels that we have established or on a more secured basis to balance sheet lending. And that continues to be how we think about our credit investment. But one of the advantages of doing this Wes, as I'm sure you recognize is this continuous headwinds that we experienced, given the refinancings that we are having to incur at much higher rates. This is a perfect natural hedge to that,, because here we are lending to clients that we have credit exposures to reflective of the current higher interest rate. And that's really part of why we believe that this is such a good strategy for us in the interim, people talk about reinvestment risk. Well, guess what, if the environment is different and interest rates actually go down. We don't have to roll our credit. Our cost of capital should be better. These headwinds that we are facing on our refinancings will dissipate. And we'll be able to, therefore, invest it in more of our traditional sources, this capital that we get back at very good yields. And so really, I think of the credit partly as a defensive mechanism and is a natural hedge to the headwinds that we faced, but also very much in line with trying to become that real estate partner to the world's leading operators, and these are operators with whom we want to continue to grow our relationship. Wes Golladay : A quick follow-up on that one. So when you talk about the natural hedge, would you look to keep these more SOFR based loans? Sumit Roy : Yeah. We do have software based loans. But by and large, what we try to do is not expose ourselves to the floating rate element. We try to lock it in, we get it but then no longer becomes a perfect hedge. But given where the environment is and given the expectation of interest rates, we are still very well protected. We have one loan, the ASDA loan that was -- it was -- it's a floater and it's off of the SONIA in the UK. But largely, every other loan that we've made has been a fixed component to it. And keep in mind that we also inherited some loans, one of which actually got paid off at 100% that we inherited from Spirit, and it was a $33 million seller financing that Spirit had provided to imagine, which, by the way, was an outcome that was superior to how we had underwritten it. So yeah, it's -- Jonathan, do you want to add something? Jonathan Pong : Yes. Well, just to add to that, when we think about it in a natural hedge, I think it's more so a lot of lines of lenders that actually matures, because we look at our maturity schedule, we've got a decent amount of debt coming to well staggered, but on a nominal basis, still pretty significant, $1.9 billion next year, for instance, or $3.26 billion at almost $3 billion in 2027. And so when you have a corresponding asset that could get cold or will get repaid and it's hard to replace that coupon in a lower rate environment, chances are we're much better off as we're refinancing our liabilities and our cost of capital is obviously much lower. So I think that's another way to take through the natural hedge element. Operator : Our next question comes from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street. Please go ahead. Harsh Hemnani : Thank you. So not a good jump of acquisitions this quarter came from ones that needed the capital and some redemptions. How would you contrast that opportunity set for acquisitions versus maybe the traditional sale-leaseback market when realty income could provide a solution for [indiscernible] financing. It sounds like based on interest rate hopes -- hopes of interest going down, more tenants are looking towards the traditional credit market and trying to look for finite sources of capital rather than locking in sale-leaseback capital for a perpetual period of time. Is that something you're seeing more so in tenant conversations today than compared to a year ago? Sumit Roy : We are certainly seeing sale-leaseback opportunities. In fact, 13% of what we closed in the first quarter, it was sale-leaseback. But you're right, Harsh. If you compare it to last year, 46% of everything we did was sale leaseback. The year before that, it was closer to 40%. And we are not seeing that. And I think part of it is because clients are trying to figure out ways to not necessarily lock into 20-year, 25-year leases at these elevated cap rates. And so if there is an alternative available to them, be it through the debt markets, which has much shorter duration, even if it is higher, I think they're going to be far more inclined to doing that. But I just want to be very clear that we are -- again, if it's a brand-new client that we don't have a relationship with, we are not going to go and provide them credit if there isn't a compelling sale-leaseback opportunity with them and our desire to have them as part of our client registry is not there. We are not going to be pure credit providers like some of the credit funds out there that exist. So, I do see that changing as there is stability in the rate environment, as people start to get much more comfortable about where things are going to sort of play out, I do believe that sale-leaseback will come roaring back. We are in discussions with some names right now. And it really is a disconnect between where they want to transact and what -- where we are capable of transacting given our cost of capital. So -- but I think it's a matter of time. Harsh Hemnani : Thanks for that. I'll leave it there. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Harsh. Operator : And our next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi, thank you. Maybe piggybacking off Greg's earlier question on dispositions, your proprietary predictive analytics platform will be used to help with dispose. Could you just give us some more color on how that works? What are some of the inputs to the analysis? Sumit Roy : Yes. That's where the secret sauce is, Linda. But all right. Let me -- and I don't want to get to pedantic, so try to keep it pretty high level. The way our predictive analytics were it is by industry and even at times by client. But largely, the models work by industry. And it tries to identify the key variables, which could be 20, 30, 40 variables that dictate the predictability of a renewal outcome or a leasing outcome. So the pieces around how we created the predictive analytic tool was to figure out, what was our leasing activity going to look like, where will we -- the risk was defined as, are we going to be able to maintain the rent that we currently have during a renewal period? Or are we -- is it going to go less? Or is it going to be more -- and that's how we define risk, and that's how we've sort of created these algorithms by industry to identify where does risk lie in our portfolio. And as you can imagine, each industry has its own set of variables that dictate that particular outcome. But the biggest piece of all of this. I think the creation of the algorithms, et cetera, is a fairly simple task. I mean it's taken us 3.5, four years. So I don't want to minimize that piece. I've got me looking at me strangely here. But it is the data that we have that allowed us to back test these models and continue to refine and calibrate these models to improve their predictability. I think that's what is whether the true value lies in our platform, having been around for 50 years. And I think that's why you see the kind of results that you see when we are posting the release -- the re-leasing spreads, when we are trying to get ahead in terms of identification of assets that we should, where we are maximizing the return profile of those assets given what we think will happen some lease renewal. I think that's where the predictive analytics tools, along with the asset management team was using on-the-ground experience to sort of share their perspective along with the credit view, that group together is what's dictating how we try to stay ahead with the portfolio. And it's -- it has to be tools driven. It has to be technology driven. When you have 15,400 discrete locations with in 80 different industries with 1,500 different clients I mean it can't be done manually. And so that's the reason why we chose to make this investment Linda, five years ago and several millions in -- this is a tool that we are very, very proud of. And it's now very much part and parcel of every decision we are making. Be it acquisitions, be it disposition, the hold decisions and also, this tool is now being used to dictate the highest and best use for potential vacancies, which may or may not be the old use of that particular asset. And we've seen some of the value creation that, that prediction has yielded for us as a platform. So hopefully, I didn't get too much into the details, but that's really how the pretty expanded tool works Linda Tsai : Appreciate the color. And then just in terms of using dispose to get back to that core portfolio you referenced earlier, can you give us some metrics or characteristics of what that looks like. You have more international exposure versus four or five years ago? How does that kind of fit to the core portfolio? Sumit Roy : Yes. For us, having geographical diversification, the advantages of it played out in the first quarter, right? I mean you saw we were able to find transactions in the UK that had a return profile that far superseded what we are able to find here in the US. And then that will flip, so I think the geographical diversity is a good thing. In terms of the actual composition of the portfolio, we clearly have what we are viewing as an optimal portfolio. And an optimal portfolio, we might like, let's call it, grocery. But we want grocery to be 13% to 14% of our overall portfolio. If that creeps into the 19% to 20%, that's not a good thing. And by the way, I'm giving you an example, that's not the case, grocery happens to be only 10% of our portfolio today. And then there are other areas like apparel that we may not necessarily want to be exposed to at all. But again, using very broad brushes across particular subsectors is not the right answer either. And that's the reason why this tool along with credit, et cetera, they help us devise what we believe to be the optimal portfolio. If you think retail and you step back, we like service-oriented businesses. We like low price point businesses. And -- that's sort of the overarching nondiscretionary overarching elements that we look for on the retail side. That doesn't mean that we won't deviate from this. But over 90% of our retail portfolio, by the way, has one or more of these characteristics. But that's, I think, how you think about the composition and geographical diversification is something that sits on top of that. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sumit Roy for any closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. Steve Bakke : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. You'll disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. In the second quarter, I am pleased we were able to deliver strong results of the economy as well as the transaction market, navigate today\u2019s rate environment. We see to be real estate partners to the world\u2019s leading companies and the diligent efforts of our dedicated team resulted in AFFO per share of $1.06 representing a robust 6% growth compared to last year. Combined with our annualized dividend yield in excess of 5% our shareholders owned a total operational return of over 11%. The power of our global sourcing and acquisition platform was on display this quarter as we deployed capital in the U.S. and Europe across retail, industrial and data center real estate, and the real estate-backed credit opportunities. In total, we invested $805.8 million into high-quality opportunities at a blended 7.9% initial cash yield, or an 8.2% straight-line yield, assuming CPI growth of 2%. Of this, approximately $262 million of volume was invested in the U.S. at a 7.6% initial cash yield. The balance of approximately $544 million was invested in Europe at an 8% initial cash yield, including a $377.5 million investment in a secured note at an 8.1% yield issued by Asda, a leading U.K. grocery operator. As we discussed in the past, we intend to pursue credit investments selectively, and only when it may eventually facilitate access to high-quality real estate opportunities, as has been the case with Asda. We also believe these credit investments represent a profitable means for Realty Income to participate in and benefit from the current rate environment. Furthermore, from a risk management perspective, we view these credit investments as a prudent, natural hedge to the inherent rate exposure as we have on the liability side of our balance sheet. Providing further detail on investments in the quarter, we executed 79 discrete transactions with 55 clients, including two new clients across 22 industries. 31% of direct real estate investment volume was allocated to new sale leasebacks. Touching on our sourcing activity, we were pleased that our transaction discipline earlier this year is bearing fruit. As this quarter, we began to see a greater number of opportunities available at pricing that aligns with our cost of capital. This improvement supported the $200 million increase in transaction volume sequentially, and it drove the investment guidance increase to $3 billion in June, a 50% increase from our prior guidance. We believe the higher closed volume paired with investment spreads that are largely consistent with last quarter are signs the transaction market may be moving towards normalization. Investment activity this quarter was funded in large part by adjusted free cash flow, which totaled approximately $200 million in the second quarter. Not having to rely on public equity enhanced the accretive nature of these transactions. The deployment of excess cash flow represents an important contributor to our growth. In fact, we believe we can utilize excess free cash flow together with our portfolio's internal rent growth to deliver an approximate 7% to 8% total operational return annually to shareholders without relying on public equity issuance. The portfolio's stabilized internal growth rate has risen in recent years, and now stands at approximately 1.5% on an annualized basis, in part because of the expansion of our European platform, where many leases are subject to uncapped CPI increases, as well as our expansion into the gaming and data center verticals, which where leases often include healthy annual rent escalators. With the benefit of excess free cash flow, second quarter capital deployment activity resulted in investment spread of approximately 293 basis points, which like the first quarter is well above our historical spread of 150 basis points, in part due to the utilization of excess free cash flow. As a reminder, these disclosed investment spreads utilize our short-term nominal cost of capital, which measures the estimated year one earnings dilution from raising capital on a leverage neutral basis to fund our investment volume. This is different from a higher long-term cost of capital, which applies a growth premium to our cost of equity to account for the long-term return requirements for our investors. While we remain vigilant in today's volatile environment, seeking only the most attractive risk adjusted return opportunities, we will also only utilize external capital opportunistically aiming to augment our growth rate at times when our cost of capital becomes increasingly attractive as compared to prevailing market investment yields. An additional source of capital in the second quarter was dispositions. We utilize proprietary predictive analytic tools in combination with the insights of our asset management and research teams to drive the decision to sell 75 properties for total net proceeds of approximately $106 million, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $202 million. For the year, we expect to sell between $400 and $500 million of assets. As we continue to calibrate and hone our predictive analytic tools, advancing our investment pieces on each property in our portfolio, we may be more active on dispositions than in the past. We continue to optimize our portfolio composition and investment returns while broadening our use of organically generated capital to finance growth. Another critical point of differentiation for Realty Income is the strength of our balance sheet, underpinned by our low leverage of 838 minus credit ratings by Moody's and S&P respectively, and our access to capital on a global basis. During the second quarter of 2024, the combination of internally generated cash flow and disposition sale proceeds allowed us to fund most of our investment activity without settling any newly issued equity capital while still maintaining our leverage metrics at or below our long-term targets. Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to generate very solid returns and to perform in a very stable fashion. Occupancy rose to 98.8% as of June 30th, a 20 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Additionally, our rent recapture rate across 199 leases was 105.7%, totaling approximately $34 million in new annualized cash rent. The size, scale, diversification, and consistency of performance from our global real estate portfolio continues to provide us with excellent visibility to revenue and is a key reason why we have not had a single year of negative operational return in our 30 years as a public company. Managing through periodic store closures is a natural part of our business model, and our top-tier credit research and asset management teams offer distinct competitive advantages, which have consistently enabled us to optimize value in these situations. To that end, we would like to provide remarks on a few clients that are currently managing through store closures or have been in the news due to credit-related concerns. Importantly, in the context of our portfolio's size and scale, the aggregate financial exposure of potential loss rent is not expected to materially impact our ability to generate the consistent operational returns our shareholders are accustomed to. And it is important to emphasize our recent increase in earnings guidance takes all credit considerations into account. Rite Aid, which represents 30 basis points of our total portfolio analyzed contractual rent as of June 30, 2024, is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in the third quarter. Through the remainder of the bankruptcy process, we expect to lose 12 basis points of rent prior to the resolution of assets vacated in the proceedings, which are ultimately released or sold. Red Lobster represents 1% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rents and it is currently moving through the bankruptcy process. At present, as publicly stated, Red Lobster is targeting to emerge from bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2024. We continue to believe that our visibility into rent coverage and our master lease structure across most of our properties mitigate some of our potential risk. And while not finalized, we currently believe our recapture rate will be roughly in line with our historical portfolio-wide average of 84% for client bankruptcy restructurings. Walgreens is considered closing certain stores. Looking out over the next two and a half years, we have leases representing only 26 basis points of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent that will expire over that time. Outside of a bankruptcy strategy, which we view as unlikely with Walgreens, these are the only stores Walgreens can legally seize contractual rent payments on once each lease expires. To provide context on historical capture rates in the drugstore industry, we have managed 166 lease expirations since 2013. 80% of these were renewed. That resulted in a blended recapture rate in excess of 100% of prior rent. Dollar Tree, which is investment-grade rated, announced the potential split of their Family Dollar brand from Dollar Tree. If this were to result in store closings, Family Dollar leases representing only five basis points of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent are set to expire between now and year-end 2026. And of course, in the interim, they are obligated to continue paying rent through lease expiration. Our historical recapture results in the dollar store industries have been similarly favorable. We have managed 263 lease expirations since 2013, of which 86% of the clients renewed at a weighted average rate well north of 105%. In case of our tier 1.5% of exposure, we feel the risks have notably diminished in the past 12 months. Cineworld reduced its debt by $4.5 billion through its restructuring, and AMC recently made improvements to its financial position by extending debt maturities and additional equity issues. It is important to note that in total, the rent at risk from Rite Aid, Red Lobster, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, as well as At Home and Big Lots, which is 11 basis points of rent, represents in total only 2.3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent through year-end 2026. And if we achieve the recapture rate in line with our long-term average for bankruptcies, which is 84%, this suggests only approximately 37 basis points of rent is at risk of ceasing, or an approximately $0.02 of AFO per share impact. In addition, if they do take place, advance notice of potential store closures are of incremental value to us because they provide years, in many instances, to plan the optimal outcome at those locations where the client's plan is to leave while we continue to be paid rent. This $0.02 per share potential impact is manageable and is counterbalanced by the power and stability of our net lease business model, which is underpinned by diversification across more than 15,000 properties, 1,500 clients, and 8 countries on 2 continents. Hence, we believe it is important to separate the store closing headlines from the manageable impact they have on our financials. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Jonathan? Jonathan Pong : Thank you, Sumit. Consistency has long been a benchmark by which we manage our business. To that end, we ended the second quarter with leverage at 5.3 times without settling any ATM equity during the quarter. This was the 25th consecutive quarter of leverage at 5.5 times or lower, reflecting our commitment to our A3, A- credit ratings, which we have had now since 2018. As a reminder, we manage our leverage through the lens of net debt and preferred equity to annualize pro forma adjusted EBITDA. During the second quarter, we generated approximately $200 million of adjusted free cash flow, over $100 million in real estate sales proceeds, and approximately $185 million of forward unsettled equity sold through the ATM. After modest ATM issuance activity subsequent to quarter end, we currently have almost $450 million of unsettled forward equity, which we estimate will be more than sufficient to finance our equity needs for the remainder of 2024 and still remain within our target leverage ratios. Our balance sheet remains healthy with a well-staggered debt maturity schedule that allows us to be active should borrowing costs trend lower over the maturity cycle. Last month, we repaid $350 million of maturing public notes, leaving us with only $118 million of maturing mortgage debt for the balance of the year. Our exposure to variable [ph] rate debt of $1.6 billion remains modest at only 6.3% of total debt principal at quarter end, and our liquidity remains solid with access to approximately $3.8 billion of capital. At the end of the second quarter, inclusive of cash on hand, availability under our $4.25 billion revolving credit facility and our outstanding ATM forward equity. We remain comfortable with the liability side of the balance sheet and believe we are well positioned to act on larger investment opportunities should they present themselves. As Sumit mentioned earlier, we view our credit investments as a natural hedge to the inherent interest rate risk associated with debt maturities we have on our balance sheet. That end, the six year \u00a3300 million sterling senior secure loan we invested in during the quarter provides us with an attractive 8.1% yield secured by the solid credit of a U.K. grocery store operator, while reducing the rate sensitivity on the value of sterling debt we have on the balance sheet maturing in 2030, which currently totals \u00a3540 million. From a 2024 earnings guidance perspective, we are reiterating our full year investments at $3 billion in our AFFO per share guidance of $4.15 to $4.21, which represents 4.5% annual per share growth, assuming the midpoint. As a reminder, we increased our guidance on June 4, which included the expectation of collecting the $16 million of lease termination fees that we recognized in the second quarter. Offsetting a portion of AFFO tailwinds with termination fees was the recognition of approximately $6.2 million of AR reserves from one of our clients in the convenience store industry. Lease termination fees are excluded and are same-store rental revenue calculations, while AR reserves are included. Thus, the $6.2 million of reserves that we recognized on one client in the quarter alongside impacts by theatre portfolio held back our second quarter same-store rent growth by approximately 60 basis points, resulting in overall same-store growth of 0.2% for the quarter. Including this reserve, we continue to expect our full-year same-store rental revenue growth recovered to close to the 1% level for 2024. With that, I would like to hand the call back to Sumit for closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. To conclude our prepared remarks, the year is progressing largely in line with expectations, perhaps even slightly ahead. There are signs the transaction market is beginning to normalize as we find more opportunities to deploy capital into high-quality investments, meeting our minimum return requirements. Adjusted free cash flow and dispositions continue to be accretive sources of capital we can use to support future growth. Combined with the stability of our solidly performing client base and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to shareholders in a variety of economic environments. I'd like to now open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The largest component of your investment volume this quarter was the investment in the Asda notes. How should we think about the different investment buckets that you have when it comes to expectations for the back half of the year? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Michael. That's correct. We did have a $377 million investment in the Asda loan, which was very opportunistic. We've already highlighted the reasons as to why we did that. What you should expect for the balance of the year, for the remaining half of the year, is that we are probably going to have the majority of our investments, if not 100% of our investments in our more traditional investment asset level, portfolio level, real estate direct investment. That's what's going to make up the balance of the remaining six months. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. Then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about the opportunities you're seeing in the U.S. versus European markets? Outside the loan, you leaned a little bit more to the U.S. in the second quarter or a reversal from the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in these markets and the spreads in the U.S. versus Europe? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Yes. During the first quarter, we had said that we're starting to see some green shoots here in the U.S. where sellers were starting to realize the higher cap rate environment was here to stay. That obviously resulted in an increase in volume in terms of investments here in the U.S. in the second quarter. We expect that to continue into the remainder of the year. The volume increase that we saw with regards to sourcing would also attest to that phenomena. I think with the backdrop that we are seeing on the cost of capital side, I do think that there will be more transactions that will materialize in the next half, especially here in the U.S. The markets in Europe have been fairly stable. I think the expectations of the interest rate cuts were well understood. What we saw in the first quarter where we had some opportunistic sellers come to the market and be with the beneficiaries of those transactions. Similar transactions took place in the second quarter. And we feel pretty confident that, that trend will continue for the remainder of the year. But you should see an increase in volume coming from the U.S. and more of the same in markets outside the U.S. Operator : The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes hey guys. Maybe just going back to the Asda loan. I think you've done some other loans in the past that were pretty sizable. Just kind of how do you think about like the duration risk and just like when you're typically taking the equity stake and doing a real estate loan, it's like you'd assume that real estate forever, but for a loan, it's kind of limited duration. Like how does that factor into your underwriting? Just like is there a limit maybe on exposure you want to have for lending? Sumit Roy : Yes. So Joshua, we've been very clear with the market that the credit investment side of the business is an addendum to what we are offering our clients. We believe that opportunistically, it makes a lot of sense for us to continue to be a partner to our clients, such as Asda. And when you look at the investment we made, $377 million at an 8.1% 6-year paper [ph] and you overlay the fact that we have maturing debt close to \u00a3600 million coming due in about the same time frame, this is one of the reasons why we did what we did. Let me put this in perspective in a slightly different way. If we were to go out and try to do a sale leaseback on Asda real estate today, it would probably be in the mid-6s, maybe even in the slightly inside of that. And so for the same credit, if you're able to get 160, 170 basis points of additional spread over a 6-year period. I think it's -- and get the same exposure in terms of the credit. It's something that for us made a lot of sense. The other reason is one that we've continued to share with the market around why we have gone down this path of credit investments. We've always felt like, okay, we want to be long-term partners to some of our clients. We are willing to do 20-year paper sale leasebacks on their real estate. We are along the credit. We like the credit and if we can continue to create an even closer relationship by participating, higher up on the capital stack, that is something that makes a lot of sense for us. Especially when you take it in the context stuff, we are experiencing the negative impact of higher interest rate environment on our own balance sheet. And if we can offset using this credit investment as a tool, this negative impact that we experienced by participating on the asset side by providing credit to some of our clients then this is a very nice way to hedge this negative impact. Having said all of this, we've also been very clear that credit investment is going to be a point in time. This is not a tool that will work in every environment, and we don't expect to do credit investments in a very low interest rate environment. And so for all of the reasons that I've just enumerated, it's a wonderful tool to have. And thankfully, we have the relationships with clients who want us to participate, we would like to participate and it acts as a natural hedge to some of the negative headwinds that we encounter in this environment. So that's why we did what we did. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. And then maybe just one other question. Just you mentioned the expansion into data centers and gaming. It helps drive internal growth by going into those verticals. I guess are there any other verticals you're looking at or where you think you can get that higher internal growth rate if you're already in that vertical? Sumit Roy : Yes. So the areas that give us that higher internal growth largely are the two you've mentioned and the international market. And obviously, this is not a new vertical for us, but industrial does tend to have higher internal growth as well. And the combination of our investments in these areas have resulted in the profile of internal growth changing from circa 1% in our business to 1.5%. And that will continue to be the areas that we focus in, in the future. I think this was a question that was asked in the previous call as well. Are there any new verticals that we are looking at? And the answer is no. We have a very well-defined total addressable market based on the verticals that we've already articulated to the market, and we are very comfortable continuing to play in those specified verticals. And there's plenty to be done. So we're very happy with that. Operator : The next question comes from John Kilichowski from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Kilichowski : Hi, thank you. So the amount of IG tenants as a percentage of acquisitions was 10%, which I believe is lower since the third quarter of 2017. Maybe how should we think about that and your appetite to move down the risk curve to generate yields here? Sumit Roy : Yes. I don't necessarily agree with the last comment that you made in your question that John. But I'll go ahead and answer this question around investment grade representing 10% of our investments in the second quarter. We've always been very clear with the market when we've said that we don't target investment grade as a criteria for investment. What we are looking for is are we generating the right yield for the credit risk that we are taking for the real estate risk that we are taking, etcetera. And the actual ratings of the client is a byproduct of being able to underwrite appropriate risk-adjusted return profile. And if it so happens that we have clients that are investment grade as a result of that risk-adjusted profile that we are targeting. That's great. But it's not something we specifically look for. Case in point, John, if you look at our portfolio today, there are so many names in our top 20. That just happened to be non-rated. And have they gone through a rating process, they would be investment-grade. Companies like Sainsbury's, Treasury Wine Estate, we have grocers like Public and Trader Joe's that are not rated today and don't constitute an investment-grade bucket for us, but if they were to be rated, they would be. And so the point I'm trying to make is it's not something that we target. It's a byproduct of our underwriting, and we are very comfortable continuing down that path. John Kilichowski : Understood. And then I guess maybe jumping to bad debt here. On the last call, you mentioned the conservative nature of your bad debt number. I don't believe you provided it, but maybe could you talk about where it is today and if there's upside to your guide here? Jonathan Pong : Yes. So if you just look at what we disclosed in the footnotes of the income statement on the earnings press release or the supplement, you'll see that we've recognized around $9 million on a year-to-date basis in bad debt expense. And so looking at that as a percentage of revenue, it is around 70 basis points or so. Now what we've always said is that historically, we've been roughly in the 35 basis point range as a percentage of revenue is the bad debt expense. And when you strip out the pandemic, it's closer to 23 basis points. So we're a little bit ahead of that, but a lot of that was related to this $6 million reserve that we did and uptaking on 1 C-store operator, we do not expect the magnitude of that to carry forward into the back half of the year. But there is still a little bit of conservatism there. And I think from our standpoint, even though we feel very good about a lot of these credits. I think in the back half of the year, you can assume that we're assuming something close to what we recognized in the first half. Operator : The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess first question, just a follow-up on the Asda loan. I guess, are there any purchase options or agreements attached to the loans? And I guess I'm assuming these are assets you wouldn't mind owning at some point. And then as part of that, I guess I just want to confirm, based on your comments in the call that we should not anticipate you doing more loan deals in the second half of the year, that there's nothing else from that type of activity embedded in the guide? Thanks. Sumit Roy : So Haendel, yes, the last comment you made is accurate. We are not anticipating doing any credit investments in the second half but just to be very clear, credit investments is something that we have used opportunistically in the past, and we will continue to use opportunistically going forward. But it is not contemplated that we will do any in the second half. Having said that, you're right, this is a secured bond offering. And so it is the security that we have is obviously a lot of the unencumbered real estate that as continues to own. You're also correct in assuming that we are very comfortable going along the credit. You might recall in the third quarter of last year. We did a fairly large -- I want to say, norther $600 million of sale leaseback with Asda. So this is a credit that we are very comfortable with. We like the operators. We like what they're trying to do with their business. And this is a way for us to continue to strengthen that relationship going forward. But yes, part of what we are trying to do is in the event they decide to go down the path of doing sales leasebacks, we're going to be first in line. There are no guarantees, but we will be first in line for those conversations. And that's exactly the type of position we would like to be in going forward with clients such as this. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Helpful. And one more, if I may. I was intrigued by your comments on the investing landscape today. It sounds like you're seeing more opportunities to fit your buyback given your improved cost of capital and that seems like you're willing to be more active if the right opportunities present themselves. But I guess I'm curious if the lower cost of debt and just improving cost of capital more broadly is perhaps allowing some private competition to rent to the space. So I'm curious if you're seeing any incrementally new competitors or private equity reentering the landscape here? Thank you. Sumit Roy : Sure. Good question, Haendel. Look, I think it's a little too early, but the reality is that in the event that interest rates do start to come down, private equity that has largely been absent from the market should start to come back in. We are not currently seeing that in the transaction that we are pursuing. We are seeing some institutional capital, I wouldn't call them private equity coming into the market and becoming a bit more aggressive. But it's not prevalent yet. But yes, if the interest rate environment continues to be positive, i.e., rate cuts start to materialize, finding private equity as a competitor is certainly something that we should expect. You talked about us becoming more aggressive given our cost of capital having improved, especially over the last couple of weeks. That is true. And our cost of capital has improved. But the point I want to keep making, Haendel, is we want to remain very disciplined. We do believe that there will be more transactions that should take place just given the backdrop that we've talked about. But we don't have to do a whole lot to generate the earnings guidance that we've shared with the market. And if the market opportunistically produces transaction for us, that we feel like makes a lot of sense for our portfolio, we will absolutely be first in line to take advantage of that. And that's the position that we want to be in. And -- but I don't think the fact that our cost of capital has improved, that's going to be the impetus to go out there and start doing more transactions. I think the materialization of actual transactions that we would like to be successful pursuing that is going to drive what we do in the second half. And we feel based on everything that we are seeing, plus the pipeline that we have, very confident that the investment market will continue to improve. Operator : The next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. Just on that, I was just wondering about the transaction activity that you kind of had in your pipeline. I mean do you see more kind of larger portfolio deals in the offering? Or is it more kind of smaller kind of one-off transaction opportunities, just insert changes since your last quarterly call? Sumit Roy : Smedes, there are some large front actions that will be coming to market in the second half. These are existing clients that we have that we are in constant conversations with as to whether we are lucky enough to win those transactions or whether they actually end up coming to market is still a bit of a question mark. But we are starting to see those types of conversations taking place, and we feel pretty good that the market is going to improve. Our pipeline is largely along the lines of what we've achieved to date on the straight up organic acquisition side. And there aren't any $1 billion portfolio. So that's what you're thinking that we have in our pipeline yet. But the conversation leads me to believe that there will be larger portfolios coming down, but we'll see. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, too, I'm sorry if you maybe address this, but the termination fees you received in the quarter, they were related to one particular client or with a bunch of fees that happen to cut it at once. So just kind of wondering what they were related to? Jonathan Pong : Yes, Smedes those related to one particular tenant. And it's really reflective of an agreement that our team will be able to reach with them for a handful of assets, not the entire exposure, but just a handful. Operator : The next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Hey hope you're doing well. I was just hoping to get a little more color on how you're identifying assets for disposition, whether that's tenant credit, renewal risk, geography? Any color would be appreciated. Sumit Roy : Sure, Greg. So a lot of it is very, it's opportunistic. It is an analysis, a very deep analysis that the asset management team takes on looking at assets for existing clients that may not have the right return profile that longer term because the markets have changed, or that particular location is not what it used to be. There could be several reasons as to why they get into the disposition list, one of which could be credit as well. And so we are using our predictive analytic tools to help monitor these 15,000 assets that we have at any given point in time and it's coming out with a rating that then suggests that, hey, this one may have a high location risk or low fungibility available to these locations. And then we overlay the credit on top of that. And then asset management goes through those and tries to create various different areas of what is the economic outcome going to look like under , for instance, a client that may not have any credit issues will pay rent. But at the end, this asset may not have other alternatives available to it outside of a vacant sale. And that return profile will be compared with selling it today to see what yields a better outcome. And that's the analysis that the asset management team is undertaking far more directly today than I think we've done in the past and that's the reason why we've come up with the $400 million to $500 million of assets that we feel like does not necessarily have a long-term future in our portfolio. And that's how we come up with the list. Greg McGinniss : Okay, thank you. And then on acquisitions, how should we be thinking about your view on investment spread with the improved cost of capital versus what you're actually seeing in the market. The U.S. cap rates were up 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Is that kind of a fair target area? Or could we see that start to come back in? Sumit Roy : Greg, as you know, I think I don't see the cap rates moving out from these levels. And in fact, they probably are going to start to come in going forward just given the backdrop that we are all experiencing with better cost of capital, more competitors are going to start to come in. It's going to put pressure on the cap rates. So, but in terms of spread, which is how we think of our business, we are very hopeful of maintaining the spreads that we've achieved thus far. And it could be a combination of our improving cost of capital despite perhaps a slightly lower cap rate environment. But we are going to be very selective in what it is that we pursue, which is why we have not gone out and increased our acquisition guidance. But let's wait and see what happens over the next couple of months. Things are fairly volatile with elections coming up later this year. And obviously, we see what's happening on the geopolitical side. So it is a bit of a volatile period. But having filtered all of that, I think you should expect to see us trying to maintain the spreads that we've achieved thus far. Operator : The next question comes from Upal Rana from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Upal Rana : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sumit you touched on dispositions already, but I wanted to get your reasoning on providing guidance at this point? And is this a product of better visibility or a shift in strategy you did mention that you do impact -- expect to be more active on that front than the past. So you have sold a number of vacant properties already this year, but you still have another 185 more to go. So I want to get any color on that, that would be helpful. Sumit Roy : Yes. Good question, Upal. You should expect at the end of it all, half of it to be occupied assets and half of it to be vacant assets. So clearly, the trend for the first half has been more vacant asset sales. So that's going to shift going forward. It is a slight shift in our strategy, but not if it is driven by two very large M&A deals that we've effectuated over the last 2.5 years. And clearly, and we've been very upfront about this. There are assets that we've inherited that it's not a long-term strategic hold for us. And so we just want to be more proactive in being able to dispose of these assets. And given the quantum of capital that this particular process can generate for i.e., $400 million to $500 million, we wanted to be very clear with the market that look, this is going to be a source of capital for us that you may or may not be aware of. And so people can appropriately underwrite that source of capital. And when we make statements like we don't have to be out in the equity market, this helps explain that piece. But the strategic rationale is always are constant vigilance on what is it that our portfolio looks like? Where has our strategic shifts occurred given everything that we are seeing and being a lot more proactive on the disposition side than we had traditionally been. Upal Rana : Okay. Great. That was helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the transaction market moving towards normalization. What did you mean by that? Did you mean in terms of volume, cap rates investment spreads, seller sentiment, competition? Maybe if you can give more any detail on that, that would be helpful. Sumit Roy : Sure. So obviously, a lot of sellers were on the sideline hoping for cap rates to move, we've always talked about the cost of capital is a mark-to-market variable that's essentially getting marked every second but cap rates tend to be stickier. And when the cost of capital changed as abruptly as it did for a lot of the REIT sector, the sellers were not able to accept that environment. And so they were waiting on the sidelines, expecting things to change, but sellers can't wait indefinitely. And we've seen that phenomenon play out in the international markets more so than here. And so when that happens, sellers start to creep back into the market after a period of time. And the added element that's taking place is there's a little bit more clarity today, and I say that and I smile as to where the interest rates are going to go, and so obviously, the cost of capital side of the equation has changed for a lot of the REITs. And so this is going to allow them to transact on transactions on assets that they would have looked at doing had their cost of capital being better. And so I think it's a movement on the buyer side. It's going to be a movement on the seller side. And that's what I mean that this should facilitate more transactions in the second half than it has in the first half. Operator : The next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Yes, hi. The 1% of same-store revenue growth you're achieving this year. What does it look like for next year if your portfolio stabilized internal growth rate is 1.5% on an annualized basis? Jonathan Pong : Yes. So Linda, first of all, there's some moving pieces with this year's guidance of approximately 1% on same-store. It's a difficult year-over-year comp because we did have some reserve reversals and deferment payments that we realized last year. Last year, we had 1.9% was our same-store number. This year at 2%, you're kind of averaging -- this year at 1%, excuse me, you're kind of averaging outside 1.5 or so level. And so next year, there should be an easing of the difficult comps, but what we've always been framing for investors, especially more recently is that we are around 1.5% on a contractual rent basis, growth basis. And we would expect that to continue next year and beyond. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then assuming an 84% recapture rate through year-end 2016, you only have 37 bps or $0.02 of AFFO per share impact at risk. Could that mean that your bad debt outlook in 2025 is stable or even less than what we saw this year? Sumit Roy : Linda, the way to think about bad debt is we start the year expecting a certain percentage of bad debt expense. And in certain years, we either meet bills in a lot of years, we beat them. And in certain other years like the pandemic year, it goes beyond what we had originally gone into the year with. I think this is one of those -- like last year, for instance, we had positive outcomes on what our initial expectation was, which was, I think, 40, 50 basis points of rent. And all of last year, we not only did not have any bad debt expense, we actually ended up collecting on rents that we had on cash accounting. So that was a positive outcome. This year, this seems to be trending more in line with what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And there is some potential upside, but we are not -- we've still got five months left, and we'll see how things play out. But traditionally, it's been right around that 23% absent the pandemic year. And inclusive of the pandemic year, it's been right around 37%, 37 basis points, sorry, 37 basis points of rent that has basically been bad debt expense. So do we expect 2025 to be similar, yes? But we generally don't talk about years well in advance, which is why I'm pointing to what historically has happened at Realty Income. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Fagan [ph] from Baird. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Kind of to go back to the C-store client, that litigation. Do you have that space back? And is there already a replacement tenant for that asset? Sumit Roy : We don't, Alex, which is why we are in litigation and which is where the upside comes from. So we've essentially that this year is going to be a resolution year. Once we get those assets back, we are very confident in our ability to find alternative clients in the C-store space for those particular locations. So that's where the upside is. And no, we are not expecting to resolve any of that this year. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe for Jonathan. What are you thinking about future debt issuances, what currency is currently most attractive? And at what rate can you issue that? Jonathan Pong : Yes, look, so if we were to sit here today and guess what indicative is might be on 10-year unsecured paper, you're probably looking at the very low 5s, call it, 5.1, 5.2 for U.S. dollar and sterling and then you're probably looking at very low 4s, about 100 basis points tighter in the Eurozone. So we always want to have a level of flexibility, I think when you look at how far wide sterling has traded relative to the dollar over the last few years and now that it's back to parity, we have been leaning more towards the dollar side over the last few years, and the optionality is there for us because we do have the currency net investment hedge capacity to be active in the sterling market. But obviously, the more euro deals that we do and transact on the greater the ability for us to access 4% paper will be. So these are the kind of things that we think about on a daily basis. A lot of it depends on the currency of the assets that we're bringing on the books. But we're glad that we left quite a bit of capacity in these currencies that are starting to trade at parity or even inside of it relative to a dollar. Operator : The next question comes from Spenser Allaway from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Spenser Allaway : Maybe just one going back to the transaction market. Can you just comment on where you're seeing the largest bid-ask spreads either across property types or industries? Sumit Roy : For the first half of the year spent it was here in the U.S. That's the reason why our volumes were much lower than what was -- that's what was traditionally seen in what we've done. I think that's starting to compress that bid-ask spread, which is the reason why we feel pretty confident that the markets here in the U.S. is going to start to materialize favorably for us. And yes, so that's what we see. Operator : The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey just two quick ones for me. Just one, just on the interest cost. Can you remind us how much of the guidance this year, the FFO growth, how much of it was a drag just from higher interest expense and so forth? And how are you thinking about sort of the maturities in 2025? Jonathan Pong : Yes. So definitely it wasn't much of a drag this year. I mean luckily, for us, we came out and did a debt offering in January and that was in the very low 5s, just above 5. So when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, not a big difference. We did obviously have a $350 million bond that we did repay. So there's a little bit of dilution from that. But I think when you look into 2025, we've got $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion, a 4.2% I just talked about how maybe there's 100 basis points of dilution if we were to do something like sterling and dollars based off of today's indicative rates that would have no more than about a 50 basis point impact to earnings. So it's obviously come in quite a bit. But obviously, if we have something from a euro standpoint that we can take advantage of that it will be breakeven for 2025 for short-term borrowings. Yes, it has been a little bit more dilutive because we peaked with the Fed funds rate this year. But I think much better than it was last year where that was close to 2% of growth that was held back solely because of that. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my second question was just on the new growth verticals specifically, just double clicking on sort of data centers and sort of gaming. Obviously, you've done two great deals with two great partners. But just wondering as you're thinking about sort of the future deals opportunity, is there sort of any bless and learns any way that you want to structure it differently maybe that you're thinking about as the opportunity gotten more attractive, less attractive? Just trying to get a sense of where we are 12, 24 months into this process? Thanks. Sumit Roy : Thanks, Ronald. So on the gaming side, just based on performance of the assets that we have visibility into -- it's clearly been a great investment for us. Both the assets that we currently either own 100% or partially owned have continued to perform, and we -- then the leases that were structured were, in our view, very favorable leases. It was a fair lease both to the operator and to us. And I'm not sure if there's anything there that we would change based on what we've learned over the last two years. On the data center side, we've only got one investment that has now come online. And we are very excited about continuing to work with our partner, our existing partner and some new partners that we are trying to cultivate within this space. Like I've said, the hyperscale business with enterprise clients, it's a massive business and one that I don't think any single or even three, four sources of capital can solve. And we believe that this is a total addressable market that has a place for somebody like us partnering with the right developers, operators to create our own portfolio that grows from where we are today. And I don't need to go into the thesis as to the why, but it's fairly new for us to really reflect on lessons learned. We are still trying to build that particular pipeline up. And in time, I'm sure we will share lessons learned. But one of the things that we are very focused on, and this is not necessarily based on our own history, but the history of this particular sector is to make sure that the rents that we are underwriting to day one are rents that can be supported come to renewal time, even 10, 15 years out. And I think that was one of the lessons that this particular sector had to learn the hard way when they went through renewals and they were taking write-downs in space. But outside of that, make sure that things that can become obsolete are investments that we would want the operator to make. And we stay as close and as true to the real estate as we possibly can. That's really the lens through which we are looking at the data center space. Operator : We have a follow-up question from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi, thanks for taking my follow up. Just on the 84% recapture rate. How much does that number move around any given year? And could that actually go down next year if you have a longer run rate for knowing when those closures are going to happen? Sumit Roy : No. The 84% is our historical average through the bankruptcy process. So any client that goes through a Chapter 11 process and if you compare the emerging rent to the pre-bankruptcy rent, that recapture rate is 84%. And Linda, if you look at the amplitude within that 84%, if you actually look at individuals, we've had situations where we've collected 70% or 65% of the rent. And then there have been situations where we've collected 100% of the rent pre-bankruptcy versus post-bankruptcy. So there is variance around this 84%, but that has historically been what we've achieved. And that's the number that we are sharing with the market. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Sumit Roy : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at conferences in the coming months. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Mueller, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kelsey Mueller : Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call, in order to give everyone, the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Sumit Roy : Thank you, Kelsy. Welcome, everyone. Realty Income's third quarter results highlight our continued momentum, disciplined execution and the benefits of our global investment and operating platform. Our value proposition to investors is simple, a real estate partner to the world's leading companies. We've created a defensive and diversified real estate portfolio consisting of top-tier clients to drive stable and predictable cash flow. As a result, we've delivered positive total operational returns each year since becoming a public company 30 years ago, successfully navigating a variety of economic environments. Importantly, as we move through an improving external backdrop helped by a recent rate cut in the U.S., we've started to see a more attractive transaction landscape. Given this, we are pleased to increase our 2024 investment volume guidance to approximately $3.5 billion, underpinned by strong investment activity year-to-date as well as a robust pipeline for the fourth quarter. Concurrently, we are raising the low end of our AFFO per share guidance for the year to a range of $4.17 to $4.21. Despite some recent volatility driven by exogenous factors, we remain confident in our strategic vision and the opportunity ahead. Our investment strategy offers significant opportunities for growth across multiple verticals, including our core of retail and industrial and newer verticals such as data centers and gaming. At the same time, we are making progress towards the establishment of a private capital fund, which I'll touch on later in this call. Turning to the details of the third quarter. We delivered AFFO per share of $1.05, representing a 2.9% growth compared to last year. We invested $740 million into high-quality opportunities at a blended 7.4% initial cash yield or a 7.8% straight-line yield assuming CPI growth of 2%. Of this, $378 million of volume was invested in the U.S. at a 7.4% initial cash yield with a balance of $362 million invested in Europe at a 7.3% initial cash yield. We've seen meaningful improvements in both the U.S. and Europe. Our international markets continue to contribute a greater share of volume relative to prior years with healthy investment activity year-to-date, exemplifying the benefits we achieved by cultivating multiple avenues for growth. In total, we completed 70 discrete transactions, including four transactions over $50 million, which represented nearly 60% of our investment volume, highlighting the breadth of our platform. As I noted, the momentum we are seeing in the transaction market supports increase to this year's investment volume guidance to $3.5 billion. In the third quarter, our organic acquisition activity, which excludes credit investments as well as development spending largely negotiated in prior quarters totaled $594 million or more than double the second quarter's volume. We expect further momentum through the balance of the year, with an implied fourth quarter outlook of approximately $1.3 billion in investments, which is fully funded as we are vigilantly focused on deploying capital into high-quality opportunities that meet our risk-adjusted return requirements. Capital deployed in the third quarter yielded an investment spread of 243 basis points, above our historical average spread of 150 basis points. This spread was supported by $165 million of adjusted free cash flow available after dividend payments to fund investments. These spreads are based on our short-term nominal cost of capital that measures the year one dilution from utilizing external capital and excess free cash flow on a leverage-neutral basis to fund our investment volume. As a reminder, our ultimate investment decisions are based on our long-term weighted average cost of capital, which burdens every dollar of equity with the same cost of equity. Underpinning our increased investment activity of external capital improved by approximately 65 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to the decline in our weighted average initial cash yield of approximately 50 basis points during the quarter. Turning to portfolio operations. We've created a diversified portfolio of more than 15,400 properties with high-quality clients that have proven resilient through various economic cycles and continue to deliver stable returns. In addition, our vast data availability, proprietary predictive analytic tools and insights of our asset management and research teams enhance our ability to anticipate future trends. We finished the quarter with 98.7% occupancy, a 10-basis point decrease from the prior quarter. Our rent recapture rate on the 170 leases we renewed was 105% and totaling approximately $38 million in new annualized cash rent, thanks to the diligent efforts of our team. Separately, we are continuing to lean into dispositions as an additional source of capital. In the third quarter, we sold 92 properties for total net proceeds of $249 million, of which $87 million was related to vacant properties. This brings our year-to-date total to $451 million. For the year, we now expect proceeds of $550 million to $600 million in asset sales. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. Jonathan Pong : Thank you, Sumit. We are pleased to deliver over another strong quarter while increasing our investment in AFFO guidance for the year, reflecting continued momentum. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined in our balance sheet management. Our strong balance sheet underscored by A3/A- credit ratings and deep access to capital globally continue to represent significant competitive advantages, fueling the opportunity to grow earnings through multiple channels. Our leverage, as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA was a healthy 5.4x, well within our target ratio or 5.2x including $969 million of unsettled forward equity outstanding as of today. Our fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.6x remains in line with the 4.5 to 4.7x range. We have delivered consistently over the last seven quarters. A focus on derisking our future funding needs was a catalyst behind our two bond offerings during the third quarter, which consisted of a $500 million 30-year U.S. dollar bond offering and an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 5.49% and a dual tranche sterling bond offering that raised \u00a3700 million at a weighted average tenor of 11.1 years and a weighted average annual yield maturity of 5.4%. These offerings illustrate the diversity of debt products available to us and the intentionality of our capital diversification philosophy. Our 30-year offering was our first 30-year issuance since 2017, and our public sterling offering was our fifth non-U.S. public bond offering in approximately three years, bringing our foreign denominated outstanding unsecured debt to over $8 billion. We are grateful for the loyal support we have received from the fixed income community as we continue to expand our credit presence globally. At quarter end, we held $5.2 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity, in addition to retaining almost full capacity net of cash available on our $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, only 3.4% of our outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was variable rate in nature, illustrating the financing flexibility we have heading into the end of the year. Access to capital is paramount to the success of our company and our portfolio size, scale, diversification and our trading liquidity in the public markets, have consistently afforded us well all priced capital to grow with large-scale, high-quality investment opportunities. With that said, we strive to demonstrate a proactive forward-looking mindset as we plan, position and evolve our financing strategy for future growth. Over the last few years, we have evaluated additional sources of equity capital beyond the public markets and have recently begun in earnest to build a private capital infrastructure that we believe, over time, will leverage our strengths and expand the breadth of our capital allocation opportunities globally. I would like to hand it back to Sumit to provide additional color. Sumit? Sumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. As we mentioned last year, a natural step in our evolution is to diversify and enlarge our access to equity capital through private markets. We see multiple strategic benefits of entering the private capital business. First, the amount of equity available from private sources far exceeds that, which is available through the public markets we have traditionally accessed. The size of the U.S. private real estate market is approximately $18.8 trillion, 10x larger than the $1.9 trillion of assets owned by public REITs. Thus, private capital controls more than 90% of the U.S. commercial real estate market based on research from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Creation of a private capital investment platform is expected to provide us with access to a deep pool of institutional capital from investors who may otherwise lack the mandate or ability to invest in real estate securities. Second, access to the alternative source of equity with generally less pricing volatility will give us the opportunity to accelerate the monetization of the scalable and proven investment in operating platform we have built, in turn, supporting our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Third, a powerful element of the fund management strategy is the incremental capital-light fee earnings it's anticipated to offer. Base management income earned by managing third-party capital represents a source of recurring and potentially high-growth revenue, which we observed as receiving a premium multiple from the investment community. The vast majority of fees earned would be recurring in nature and generated through open-end perpetual life funds rather than performance-based or transaction-oriented fees. Fourth, the capability of our differentiated business model will allow us to advance this initiative with limited incremental investment while leveraging the collective talent and experience of our top-tier team and platform. We have a long history of underwriting, operating and maximizing the value of our real estate holdings, dating back to our founding in 1969. Leveraging that history, we have harnessed an impressive quantum of property level data to develop our proprietary predictive analytics model to support decision-making. With additional size and scale, these data-driven insights will become increasingly robust and accurate. Together with the expertise of our team, we believe we provide a compelling co-investing platform for investors. Finally, we believe private capital will enable us to source, acquire and manage a large percentage of available market opportunities that we currently acquire for the public vehicle. Overall, our intent is to create and operate an evergreen open-end fund that will manage private capital on behalf of institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations and large insurance companies. To be clear, this structure will be distinct from a typical private equity style closed-end fund that may have a fixed duration or a narrower opportunity set. Importantly, this fund will be designated to target institutional investors. It will not be structured as a non-traded REIT, and we do not intend to market to high net worth or retail investors. Our fund business is expected to follow the same balance sheet and prudent leverage philosophy that Realty Income describes today. We do not anticipate an adverse impact on our balance sheet strength or credit ratings Rather, it will enhance our financial flexibility. Realty Income intends to be a meaningful co-investor in the fund while receiving management and potentially incentive fees generated by operation of the fund. These additional earnings would bolster Realty Income's return on investment while ensuring incentives between public and private investors are aligned. This approach also reinforces our commitment to transparency and shared objectives. In summary, we believe this private capital platform will be complementary and additive to our existing business. We intend to take a thoughtful approach to allocating investment opportunities between realty income and the fund to maximize the returns for our public shareholders, benefiting both our shareholders and private investors. We expect this initiative to enhance our ability to grow our earnings and dividend, expand our addressable market for investments and reduce our reliance on public equity across market cycles when strategically advantageous. We look forward to sharing more information as we progress on launching the fund. In closing, our year-to-date performance has exceeded our expectations, propelled by momentum on the investment front and supported by the stability of our portfolio, consisting of leading clients across the globe. Looking forward, I'm optimistic about the multiple verticals for growth we have cultivated for capital deployment. Importantly, pairing these growth verticals with alternative sources of capital will further accelerate the maturation of our platform. I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Kilichowski : Maybe if we could jump to the 3Q acquisition guide -- or excuse me, just the acquisition numbers you put up and then talk about the acquisition guide for 4Q. There was a good bit of cap rate compression. Just curious what's going on in the acquisition market. And then maybe part two of that would be, you have a big step-up in terms of acquisition volumes. I'm curious if you can speak to the potential for maybe a transaction on the large 7-Eleven deal. And then if so, given where we've talked about cap rates being for that deal, is that accretive to your long-term weighted average cost of capital? Sumit Roy : There's a lot of questions you've asked, John. So let me just take it one at a time. The $740 million that we did in the third quarter at a 7.4% cap rate, you're absolutely right. It is 50 basis points inside of what we did in the second quarter, which was a 7.9% cap, but it is also a function of the cost of capital. If you notice, our cost of capital improved during the third quarter vis-a-vis what we were at the beginning of the year. And that improvement was about 65 basis points. So, despite the 50 basis points of cash yield compression, the fact that our cost of capital has improved by 65 basis points, it was more accretive to do the transactions that we did in the third quarter with the lower cost of capital that we were able to experience versus what we had done in the first half. So, to look at anything in isolation, just based on cap rate or just based on cost of capital, I think may lead you to the wrong conclusion. So, I would request that you take those two pieces in conjunction to figure out what is the true spread that we are being able to cultivate through these investments. The second question that you had was around the $1.3 billion approximately that we are anticipating closing in the fourth quarter. It is true that we have a very healthy pipeline and it is largely a function of what we were experiencing for most of the -- all of the third quarter, say for what's happened over the last week, 1.5 weeks where there's been a lot more volatility on the cost of capital side. But that has allowed us to basically build our pipeline and we have essentially forward funded [Technical Difficulty] in the public markets to help finance what we are planning on achieving with regards to our fourth quarter numbers. The volatility in the cost of capital is something that we always take into account when we are looking at potential opportunities and making sure that we have enough margin of safety in any particular transaction that we pursue is critical to how we think about making investments. And long term, making sure that our hurdle rates on the long-term cost of capital is superseded by, again, a healthy margin is inherently important to what we do. I'm not going to go into specifics around what transactions make up the fourth quarter. But we've heard certain comments around there being a difference in when you're buying a large portfolio versus the one-off market. I can assure you that we are in the one-off market every day. And just because you mentioned 7-Eleven, there are 35 transactions that have taken place in 2024 year-to-date and with the same approximate lease term, et cetera, if you look at where they traded, they traded at a 5 to 9 cap rate. Anytime we are pursuing a portfolio deal and there were large -- four large portfolio deals that we were able to accomplish in the third quarter, we make sure that it is at a discount to what we would be able to find in the one-off market. And that has played out, if you look at what our, the actual rent is compared to market rent that we bought, the $740 million. The rent that is inherent in that $740 million of investments is 6% below market and 26% below replacement costs. That is why we feel very confident that on a risk-adjusted basis, the transactions that we are pursuing are ones that will create long-term value for our investors. Operator : Our next question today comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Sumit, although you mentioned an improving acquisition environment benefiting full year investments based on this foray into private capital market equity raising, it seems like kind of inherently saying the limiting factor on acquisition volume this year has been capital raising and not lack of sourcing investments at widened up spreads. Do you expect the cost of equity in the fund business is going to be lower? And how well investment philosophies between the fund and core business differ to avoid any potential conflicts of interest when determining where an investment should be placed? Sumit Roy : That's a very good question, Greg. The biggest difference between the private markets and the public markets that I can point to is this focus on first year spread versus a focus on long-term IRR. When we are looking at a particular transaction that is inside of our historical spreads, which has been 150 basis points, we hesitate to pursue that transaction because it is not in line with what we can generate in the first year. And as you know, better than most, that we are valued off of that initial spread that we are able to capture, which then translates into AFFO per share growth. But that does not allow us to pursue transactions that have a similar, potentially even a higher total return profile given the inherent growth, et cetera, that they might have despite having a much lower initial cash cap rate. That is where we feel like being able to access private capital that has similar expectations on the long-term horizon, the return horizon that we have -- we focus on even as a standalone public entity, but not with that short-term focus, as acutely as the public entity does, will allow us to expand our sandbox and make investments alongside this private capital business, to take advantage of much higher growth rate opportunities, but potentially at a lower initial yield. So, we think of this as truly complementary to our business. Go ahead. Were you going to ask something else? Greg McGinniss : Yes. I just was hoping you might be able to give us maybe some examples as to types of investments or tenants that you guys have had to pass up on because of current structure versus what this this new type of equity capital will allow you to pursue? Sumit Roy : Sure. Industrial is a perfect example. We've looked at opportunities in the 5.5 ZIP code. We cannot go there today, as based on where our cost of capital is, with 3% growth, 20-year leases. You do the math and you're going to have a return profile, that is very much in line with what we're looking for long term, but we can't pursue that particular transaction because of what the -- maybe not the dilution, but the non-spread day one, that's a perfect example. There are other asset types. Data centers being a perfect example of another asset type that is going to fall squarely in this bucket, which we may not be able to pursue currently given our cost of capital. And that is a particular area of the business that we believe can help drive earnings growth for the public entity in years to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern : Yes. So, it sounds like really the target for the fund would be just a lower cap rate opportunity set. I'm curious, do you expect that there would be any overlap in the investment profiles between the two vehicles? Sumit Roy : Of course, we are going to continue to be a very large equity holder in the fund. So, our interests are going to be perfectly aligned. So, there will be a lot of opportunities that we are going to be looking at, which actually works for both entities long term, but potentially in the short term does not work for the stand-alone public entity. But this is also going to be a function of the capital raising. We are not going to be buying things into the farm that we would never have touched even taking the long-term return profile into account as a public entity. So, this is truly to enhance the box and to pursuit transactions, assuming our capital raising is successful, and participate together through the fund structure. That is how we would like to deploy capital. Brad Heffern : Okay. And then, do you have any sort of target in mind for a size where it makes sense, given just the added complication? Sumit Roy : I hope it's going to be very simple. What causes added complication. Well, it's a different pocket of capital, but unlike pockets of capital that have finite life, this is a perpetual vehicle. And we are going to be very large co-investors in this perpetual vehicle. And for all intents and purposes, it will be fully consolidated with our financial statements. So, you will have perfect visibility. The fact that we have scale and the fact that we have a platform that we are very proud of, unfortunately, does not get valued at points in time by the public markets. And this is a way for us to monetize this platform and, therefore, incur very little incremental cost to stand up this vehicle. That, too, is a value that our current platform is going to bring. And I might go so far as to say that given our size and scale, which we have talked about being such a massive advantage, this is one of the ways that we can show that to the market. Operator : And our next question today comes from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask a little bit about the $63 million charge in the quarter related to convenience store client. Is that related to the same client where you took some smaller charges in the first half of the year? And could you maybe just talk a little bit more about kind of what the outcome be there? I guess you can't name the client, but maybe just a little more color around what's going on there? Jonathan Pong : First of all, I'd say we absolutely expect a fair welcome. We've talked historically about situations where we've had credit issues in the portfolio, we've recouped north of 80% of rent that's been impacted. As it relates to the accounting that drove the $64 million charge, it's noncash first and foremost, it really has to do with the fact that upon the allocation of the original purchase price. You've got land, you've got building and then you've got the intangible, which is meant to account for the future cash flows inherent in the lease. And so, the reserve that you see, which rolls into impairment, but is classified because these were originally sale leasebacks as a financing receivable. And that's really just a difference in nomenclature and that's why it's excluded from AFFO is noncash. And we've already expensively accounted for all of the lost rent for the entire of 2024 that's built into our guidance. Sumit Roy : And I'll just add it to that just because we're talking about credit, let me just share a bit more. I mean these are assets that we really want to one control over. And we are doing everything in our power to get control of this asset. It is essentially a client who's decided not to pay rent while operating these assets. And given the work that the asset management team has done, we already have a tremendous amount of interest in these assets, which are primarily located in Texas. And so, we feel very confident about being able to replace the rent, which is not significant in this case. The actual cash rent that is very quickly once we gain control. So that's this convenience store operator. But while we are on the topic of credit, I want to walk you through some of what has dominated the conversations over the last few quarters. Red Lobster has emerged from bankruptcy and just hired a CEO. They've hired a Chief Marketing Officer. They've got a new CFO. Let me close the storyline on that. We had 216 assets, pre-bankruptcy. Nine assets were rejected through bankruptcy. We had a 91% recapture rate on that particular name. Rite Aid. We have 29 locations today. We had an 88% recapture rate on Rite Aid, which is now emerged from bankruptcy and is an ongoing concern. Regal, where we have 35 assets today and an 85% recapture rate and it has emerged from bankruptcy. So those are the story lines that have dominated multiple quarters of conversations, and this is the end result of all of those conversations. Let's talk about Walgreens. Everybody is concerned about what used to be a 2,000 store closings, which has now been reduced to 1,500. Year-to-date, we've had 13 Walgreens come up for renewal. They had lease maturity. All 13 were renewed by Walgreens. In our history of 55 renewals with Walgreens, we've had a recapture rate of over 100%. Let's throw CVS in that mix. We've had 40 leases renew with CVS in our history at over 102% renewal. Let's talk about Family Dollar, Dollar Tree. We've had 135 lease renewals with Family Dollar, Dollar Tree in our history at over 108% renewal rate. Dollar General is a similar story. So, I just asked that what we see in the headlines don't necessarily translate to what is happening on the ground for our portfolio. And that's the emphasis I want to make is that we are very selective and the data proves that out to be the case. Go ahead, Smedes. Sorry, I cut you off. Smedes Rose : No. No. I mean I appreciate the detail is understood. But of course, as we see these headlines, we have to ask about them, right? I mean that's the nature of the business. I wanted to ask you on the -- just going back to the fund for a moment. You -- I think it was asked previously, but I don't think I heard the answer. Just do you have a sense of kind of what the scope of the fund would be? And are we talking maybe $1 billion to start? Or would you see it in several billions? Or kind of how do you think about the size of the fund, I guess, initially and maybe how it might grow over time? Sumit Roy : Yes. It's too early to tell. We obviously believe in our pieces. We believe in what we are doing. We believe it's -- the benefits of what we are doing is going to accrue to our public shareholders, but it is too early Smedes me to opine on how big this could potentially become. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jay Kornreich with SMBC. Please go ahead. Jay Kornreich : I was wondering if you can comment on kind of the opportunities that you're currently seeing in Europe? And as you see things today, are you looking into exploring into new territories and do you expect that acquisition opportunity in Europe to continue to outpace the U.S.? Sumit Roy : That's a great question, Jay, given what we've done in the quarters, it is a legitimate question. Yes, 56% of what we've done year-to-date has been in Europe, but we view that as an advantage that's precisely the reason why we created all of these growth verticals to be able to take advantage of wherever the best opportunities reside. And Europe is where we found that to be the case for the first three quarters. I believe the momentum in Europe will continue. We are seeing very good opportunities in Europe. And yes, our ability to go beyond our current geography, by geography, I mean, countries in Europe is also something that we are constantly looking. And so, for the right opportunity, there are several countries that we don't happen to be in that we would consider going into with the right client and with the right opportunity. Jay had asked about the future as well. And so, the $1.3 billion that's expected in the fourth quarter, I want to close a loop on that. The momentum that I had referenced was the momentum that we are seeing here in the U.S. In Europe, the momentum has continued. It's been there at the beginning of the year. That momentum has continued, but it's in the fourth quarter that you will see it reverting back to more historical norms in terms of U.S. versus international. Operator : And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Sumit, I wanted to go back to the fund one more time. There appears to be a long list of benefits that you mentioned already, but I'm also thinking that there could be a long-term benefit of allowing you at some point to potentially generate mid-single-digit AFFO growth, your long-term kind of core growth target without the need for sizable annual equity raises when you think about your existing rent bumps and the reinvestment of your free cash flow. So, I guess, first, is that fair? And then maybe some color on if you'd look to fund it with existing assets within your portfolio and what that mix could look like? Sumit Roy : That's a very good question, Haendel. Thank you. And you're right. I mean, the idea here is we get into this business to expand the investable universe for ourselves and for the fund while making sure that we adhere to the return expectations of all parties concerned. Look, it's a mathematical fact that it's not an issue today, but 10 years from now, at the rate we are growing, if we continue to rely on just the public markets to finance our growth, we're going to run up into capacity issues. I don't believe that the public markets are, especially the fund business in the public markets are growing at the same level that we have expectations of growing as a public entity. And so, it is not a dearth of opportunities that is driving this desire to get into the fund business. it is making sure that this complementary source of equity capital will help us monetize our platform and create a business that will then allow us to continue the momentum that we have shown over the last 55 years, 30 of which has been as a public entity. That is the goal of what we are trying to do. And outside of the initial call it, seating of this fund, which, by the way, that portfolio will look and feel very similar to what Realty income looks like. And at the appropriate time, all of that will get disclosed, is a way to attract capital and start our business. But subsequently, it will be new transactions that they participate in, either alongside us or it will be on balance sheet for the public entity. That's how the business is going to function. Haendel St. Juste: No, that's incremental. I appreciate that. And one more, and I'm not sure if you answered it, but I didn't quite catch if the pipeline for the fourth quarter, if you expect the cap rates to be comparable or lower? And then just thinking about the uptick in volume into the fourth quarter, if that's an appropriate run rate to think about into next year? Sumit Roy : Yes. Haendel, I'm not going to opine on cap rates, et cetera, because things can move around quite a bit. But what I will tell you is that the spread that we are going to make will be -- will continue to be healthy and will continue to be north of our historical spreads. That you can take a fair amount of confidence. And the other piece I'll leave you with Haendel is, we have already prefunded our need for the fourth quarter. So, there is no reliance on the public markets to help fund this $1.3 billion that we are planning on doing in the fourth quarter. Hopefully, that helps. Operator : And our next question today comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Spenser Allaway : One more on the private fund. Can you maybe just talk about how time will be spent just in terms of underwriting deals and opportunities for the team in general, but also for you, Sumit. And then I know you commented on economies of scale around our data and data analytics. But just curious, if you foresee any changes to headcount or to the investment process just in the early stages of that launch? Sumit Roy : That's a great question, Spenser, because it really goes to the heart of when I say we're going to scale -- use our scale as a company that we are today to mitigate what would be an insurmountable cost for a start-up to stop this business. We have 465 people in the business. We already have a fully staffed investment arm, both here in the U.S. as well as in the U.K. and in Amsterdam, taking care of our international business. So, we don't see any need or any incremental personnel on the investment side. That's scale benefit, number 1. Scale benefit number two. We are going to be agnostic as to whether these assets are held in a fund, which, by the way, the public entity will have a fairly large interest in or whether it is on balance sheet. And thus, our asset management team that has done a superb job on the public side, both here in the U.S. as well as in the international markets in London, they will continue to manage these assets. That's benefit number two. Any dispositions, any elements of that, we already have the team here. We have a very large legal team that we are going to leverage that obviously is a massive source of pride for us given that we do a majority of the work in-house. We will continue to lean on them to help with transaction negotiations, lease negotiations, et cetera. That scale benefits, number three. We already have the setup in place -- and so we are not going to be needing new people to help do the block and tackle work that is required of an investment arm where we will have incremental cost will be around a fund manager and the reporting as well as an IR function that will be dealing with a very specific type of investor base on the private side. But outside of that, from accounting finance, which, by the way, is again something we are very proud of, will all be leveraged with the existing platform that we have. That's my comment around the incremental cost in standing this business up will be fairly muted. Spenser Allaway : Very helpful. And then just last one, can you talk about how the competitive landscape is changing? Or if there's been any changes in the U.S. and Europe right now as it relates to the transaction market? Sumit Roy : Yes, Spenser, it's the -- it's very fluid in terms of who we are starting to compete against. There is no doubt that private arms are becoming much bigger players in transactions that we are pursuing. And of course, we've had a few more companies in the net lease space that have become public. We don't run into most of them given the types of transactions that we pursue, but it is a crowded field in terms of competition here in the U.S. In the international market, it continues to be one of the biggest advantages that we have, where we are running into more competition today than we did, let's call it, a year or two years ago, but we -- but it's still not quite as intense as what we experienced here in the U.S. And most of that competition comes from private capital in the international market. So, that's the flavor of who we compete against in the U.S. and in the international markets. Operator : And our next question today comes from Upal Rana with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Upal Rana : Sumit, you talked about the momentum in the transaction market, an but I wanted to kind of get a sense on have buyers and sellers really reacted to that 50 basis points rate cut and with another 25 basis points cut likely this week and then with the 10-year really driving higher about 65 basis points since the last Fed rate cuts. So, I want to get good sense on that. Sumit Roy : Yes. I think, Upal, so much of the volatility across the curve at this point is around what will happen today. And it's the largest exogenous factor that's going to determine where the curve settles down. We are not as exposed to the short end of the curve. We are -- but it's not to the same extent as we are to the long end of the curve. And so, what's happening on the long end of the curve definitely has an impact on our cost of capital because that becomes a permanent source of financing and our ability to pursue transactions. And that is a function of inflation expectations that people have about the future. And if policies are going to get put into place, where the inflation expectation is going to suddenly be much higher than what it had been traditionally, that is going to have an impact on where the tenure is going to settle and that will certainly have an impact either on the positive side or on the negative side for the permanent cost of capital for a net lease business. And those are largely policy driven. We've had parties coming up with proposals that have a diverse set of impacts on this particular inflation expectations. So too early to tell where all of this is going to settle. It is creating a fair amount of volatility, and we are hopeful that regardless of who wins, once we have more clarity in terms of what the curve is going to look like, we'll be able to execute on business as usual. Upal Rana : Great. That was helpful. And then last one for me. Going back to the private capital fund. I know you've already listed a bunch of benefits there. But I wanted to get your sense on why now and why this makes sense in today's economic environment. And I know you mentioned capacity could be an issue in the future, but is there anything else that you may have been dealing with that was creating some friction on your end? Sumit Roy : Really, Upal, there is nothing that we are seeing either on the credit side. I think I went through a pretty detailed list to share with you that on the credit side, we feel very good. Our credit watch list actually came down by 10 basis points to 4.2%. And from the previous quarter. So, we feel very good on the credit side. We feel very good on the health of the market to precipitate transactions setting aside what's happened over the last couple of weeks, but that too shall pass is our expectation. Really, the timing is around to do this right, which obviously is our collective desire. We want to do this very slowly and we want to do it very thoughtfully and it's going to take a long time, a long time for this to become a mature business. I mean look at one of our peers who has probably one of the most successful open-ended fund businesses, and that's Prologis. And they've been in that business for 20-plus years. And today, it has become -- we can step back and say it is a super successful business that some very smart people went into 20 years ago. And so, in anticipation of what could happen 10 years from now, et cetera, when we start to run up against this, our desire to put out capital and perhaps the limits of just accessing the capital sources that we have today, that could become more acute. And so, we have to start today to build this history and to build this fun business to a point where it really starts to bear fruit for our public shareholders et cetera. And that's it. That's why we are doing it today. There is no -- there is -- it doesn't matter at which point in the cycle we would have done this, that question would and should be asked, but it's really about starting now when we don't have a need for additional capital and building this business to get ahead of what could be a limiting factor multiple years down the road. Operator : And our next question today comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Just a few quick ones. Can you give us an update on where 2024 bad debt year-to-date has trended? And what's your outlook for '25? Jonathan Pong : Yes. So, Linda, if you look at the earnings release, first nine months of this year, we've incurred about $6 million in bad debt expense. That's around 40 basis points of our rental revenue. When you take out this one C-store operator that we referenced earlier. You're really looking at sub-20 basis points on 18 basis points. We've talked historically about how when you exclude the pandemic, we've been right there around 25 basis points of credit loss in a given year as a percentage of revenue. So, to be at 18 outside of these onetime unusual events, we think is pretty indicative of a very constructive and healthy portfolio. Sumit Roy : And I think we -- as Sumit alluded to earlier, the credit loss was at 4.2%. There's really not a lot out there that we're really monitoring that meaningful. There's no 1-plus percent exposure tenants on there. We feel as though those that are on the watch list, we've been monitoring for quite some time. And in some cases, we have very good visibility into the cash flow coverage on these assets. And so, we'll get into all of the assumptions that we're baking in for 2025 come February when we release our guidance. Linda Tsai : And then in terms of the C-store write-down in the quarter, what's the potential AFFO impact on earnings? And then what do you think is the recapture rate? Jonathan Pong : So, in terms of this one C-store operator, it's really, I call it $1 million a month or so. And all of that is built in. All of that is built into our guidance. And we'll see where we trend out to in terms of recovery. But as we referenced earlier, we do feel like there could be quite a bit of interest in these assets. So, I think the default response that we have to offer up is you look at our historical precedents and being able to get 84%, 85% or recapture of any rent that's been impacted by from bank or credit event. Operator : And our next question today comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Just two quick ones back to the fund. I think you talked about some of the investments that the fund would be interesting in the fund where the public equity couldn't do it. I guess my other question is just, is there any other differences in terms of dividend policy in terms of geography, like in the fund go anywhere? And in your mind, is that investor that's going into the fund, is that a completely different investor base that would contemplate the stock? Or is there some overlap? Sumit Roy : Yes. Ron, we haven't really done any work on the investor profile, but the comments I made about how much bigger this investable universe is of potential investors to look to invest in real estate through a fund structure is what's so compelling. Is it possible that you have some of these funds that have ambit to invest in public securities and they have a mandate to invest in private direct investments? I'm sure that may be the case. But even those investors will tell you that what they have to invest through a fund structure directly into real estate is multiples of what they have on the security side. So, I can't give you a more precise answer than that, but the vast majority, I believe, are going to be investors who don't have the ability to invest in public securities but would like to utilize our platform, work with us and invest in the product that we invest in. And outside of that, the strategy is one that I've already touched on. There's not going to be anything new that the fund business is going to be doing that we won't do on balance sheet. Keep in mind that the goal is we will be a massive co-investor in this fund. And so, our interests are going to be perfectly aligned in terms of what it is that we pursue. Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then my second quick one is just an update on sort of the data center sort of initiatives. Obviously, there's been a lot of data points about demand ramping? Just how are you guys sort of seeing the pipeline in that vertical evolving? Sumit Roy : Yes. So, I won't talk about pipelines, Ronald, but what you've referenced in terms of the demand, we're seeing that in space. And we've been very lucky to be speaking with multiple operators in this space. We see it in terms of what they're showing us regarding the pipeline that they've created we are trying to craft a value proposition that is compelling to these operators. And we are very optimistic about where this particular business could go for realty income going forward. We feel like we can be a solution that helps meet some of the demand and the capital needs to execute on what is a once in a cycle type situation. And at the end of the day, we have capital allocators. And if we can allocate capital exposed to S&P 10, S&P 20 clients for 20 years, that's our core business. And so, we are excited, but it's too early to tell in terms of how this is all going to play out. Operator : And our next question today comes from R.J. Milligan at Raymond James. Please go ahead. R.J. Milligan: So, I wanted to ask a couple more questions on the funds, given those examples of some of the transactions that might be more appropriate there, has been helpful. And I wanted to be clear, do you expect the fund to invest in properties that might not necessarily have triple net leases and therefore, have better internal growth or more structured investments, development loans. So, I'm just trying to get an idea of what the mix is or if it's going to be pure triple net. Sumit Roy : R.J., what I'll share with you is you should think of these investments in terms of flow-through, rental income flowing through to NOI to be very similar to what we've done on balance sheet right? The idea is not to go and start executing on businesses that have a 40% NOI margin. That's not what we do. And so, when we talk about data centers, we are not going to be going out there and buying colocation sites where the flow-through is very different versus hyperscale single-tenant 20-year leases that may not be precisely triple net, but the flow-through is still incredibly high, i.e., mimicking what a triple net asset should be generated. That's really the -- what we are going to be doing. R.J. Milligan: Okay. And then two quick follow-ups, and I may have missed the answers. But number one, do you expect the cost of equity to be higher or lower than Realty's. Sumit Roy : So, the cost of equity as defined by long-term return hurdles should be very similar, but their focus is on the long-term hurdle rate, not on day one accretion. And that's the big difference, R.J. That's why I gave the examples that I did that the return profile long term is very similar for both of these businesses. But we, as a public entity, 100% public entity, today cannot meet our dual mandate of generating that year one spread and the long-term hurdle rate. Both those have to be met in order for us to pursue transactions in the public markets today. That's how we are valued, and we are very grateful for that. We understand that that's how -- that's the game we have to play. But there are assets that we are passing up on very high-quality assets that can meet the long-term hurdle, but will potentially have a much lower starting point. And that, I think, is what we'll be able to do through this fund structure and enhance our co-investment through the recurring asset management fee stream, which is essentially the monetization of the platform that we have. to the benefit of our public shareholders. That's how this will work. R.J. Milligan: Okay. And one last follow-up is, will Realty Income be contributing properties to the fund? Sumit Roy : There will be a seat portfolio that will allow us to have conversations with potential investors. But thereafter, it will be new investments that we pursue. That's how we're thinking about it today. So outside of that initial seed portfolio, everything else will be new transactions that we'll be pursuing. Operator : And our next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Sumit, I just want to follow up on that last question. So, you mentioned Prologis, right? And I think that's where the contribution question comes from. But -- could you instead maybe envision increasing investment into developments, which may be otherwise you wouldn't have underwritten that would then be contributed to the platform? Or would you instead pursue those developments within the platform itself? Sumit Roy : Greg, that's a very good question because when we pursue development, we do have certain accounting elements that we have to adhere to. And there are times where we are unable to recognize the full cash impact, the positive cash yield that we are able to generate on dollars that we are investing in a development scenario, just given the lease accounting that we have, that's certainly not going to be a prohibitive factor doing it through the fund structure. And so, could we do more of those? Yes. In the fund, the answer is yes. But again, it needs to meet and exceed the overall return hurdles that we would we would need to address. So, there are a lot of things that this alternative source of financing could allow us to do, which we have done as a public entity, but only in a limited way because of some of the inherent limitations that we have either in terms of how we can report stuff, et cetera. So, I do think that this will give us the flexibility and thus, the comment I made about expanding the sandbox of the types of transactions that we would be able to pursue by having this alternative source of capital available to us. Greg McGinniss : And do you already have kind of first investors in mind or conversations that you've had on this front? Sumit Roy : We have none of that in mind. We have and I think I've talked about this, what is -- the profile of this investor would look like. We certainly have that, and we are working with our advisers who have shared with us what the details are around that, but we haven't had any conversations today. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And just final follow-up for Jonathan. Is there anything specific to point to in the slight increase in the midpoint to the expense leakage guidance? Jonathan Pong : Yes. It's a combination of a few things. Greg, first of all, there's been some deferred expenses we brought forward, some that were carried forward from last year. We're just trying to get ahead of spend and trying to catch up in some cases. So, there is a little bit of heavier load this quarter. I would also say for this year, I would also say that there are some carry costs that we are incurring with a few vacant assets that do comprise a bit of an increase on a year-over-year basis from a margin perspective. And then also, I think when you're just comparing to the 1.1% leakage that we experienced last year, keep in mind we did bring in a $9 billion portfolio in January with the Spirit portfolio. And that did have slightly more leakage as well just on a run rate basis. So, I would really attribute it to those factors as what's driving the slight increase going from 1.1% and now to a midpoint of 1.35%. Operator : And our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : I just want to have a question on the development pipeline. When do you expect the nonretail to lease up? Are you holding back leasing on that right now? Sumit Roy : Yes, that's a great question, Wes. Look, it's a very small portion of the overall development. I think it's like 15% plus/minus in that ZIP code. And even though the quantum that we have identified for this particular type of development, we really don't spend until we get clarity on the leases coming through. And so, we feel very confident. We are partnering with one of the best developers in Panattoni, and we feel very confident that some of these are going to get leased up in the near term. And keep in mind, we won't make the big capital investment without having line of sight on potential clients being able to step in and take over those leases. Wes Golladay : Maybe just a quick follow-up on that, since it's more spec in nature. Are you going to get a little bit more incremental yield? Sumit Roy : Yes, absolutely. And in fact, in situations where -- we've had two buildings, one was leased and the other one wasn't. We have expectations and what we think the lease rates are going to be and -- so far, more often than not, those lease rates -- our expected lease rates have been superseded by what actually ends up happening. So, this continues to build a fair amount of confidence in not only our partners, but also our team's ability to underwrite these types of transactions. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks. Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at a conference in the coming weeks. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
