LLC Operator :  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. In addition, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And now for opening remarks, I will turn the conference over to Senior Manager of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Fildes :  Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, April 24, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Szkutak:  Thanks, Dave. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 26% to $5.35 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.49 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.85 billion. We continue to make additional investments in support of business growth consisting of investments and technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital is 9%, up from 1%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 471 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.74 billion or 23% excluding the $10 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.47 billion, up 8% or 8% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.02 billion, up 27% or 27% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 244 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units. Now I\u2019ll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.06 billion or 71.2% of revenue, compared with 73.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.18 billion or 26.2% of sales, up approximately 240 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.24 billion or 11.3% of revenue, compared with 10.8%. Tech and content was $1.82 billion or 9.2% of revenue, compared with 7.9%. Marketing was $843 million or 4.3% of revenue, compared with 3.8%. Now I\u2019ll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $11.86 billion. Media revenue grew 12% to $2.82 billion or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $7.83 billion, representing 66% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 60% to $1.2 billion. North America segment operating income increased 23% to $562 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.88 billion. Adjusting for the $24 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 18%. Media revenue grew 4% to $2.64 billion, or 4% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 27% to $5.19 billion or 26% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 66% of International revenues, up from 61%. International segment operating loss was $60 million, compared with $16 million loss in the prior period. CSOI increased 14% to $502 million or 2.5% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 10%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 19% to $146 million or 0.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $73 million. GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $82 million and $0.18 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $771 million year-over-year to $8.67 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $6.72 billion and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.5 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 19% to $10.59 billion and accounts payable days were 68 consistent with the prior year. I\u2019ll conclude my portion of today\u2019s call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q2 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.1 billion and $19.8 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 160 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $455 million loss and $55 million loss, compared to $79 million in income in the second quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $455 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between zero and $400 million, compared to $409 million in the second quarter of 2013. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, Dave, let\u2019s move to questions. Dave Fildes : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question? Operator : Absolutely, Mr. Fildes. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll hear first from Mark Miller with William Blair. Mark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC:  Hi Tom. I was hoping you could maybe just layout first, what do you think the main reasons are for the acceleration and growth here in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And then a specific question on Prime Pantry, it is one of motivations to get the customer on that program it might make get easier to convert them to Amazon Fresh. And if so, would you want to run this operation as a breakeven like you do with Kindle, to enable a bigger business, thanks. Thomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of growth, we saw very solid growth, very good growth in Q1, up 23% on a local currency basis. North-America we saw a similar growth rates in Q1 as we saw in Q4 of last year as well as Q1 of last year all at 26%. And then international we saw the growth accelerate a little bit on a exchange adjusted basis from 15% to 18% from Q4 to Q1. But we really seen is we are pleased with the overall fundamentals we continue to add new customers and stocks continues to be healthy, third party unit is a percentage of units are above 40% still very strong FBA adoption, that continues to be strong around the world, continued to add new selection. We saw strong growth in many different areas including Web Services, and so again a lot of different areas contributed to growth rate that we saw in Q1. In terms of Prime Pantry, we just think it\u2019s an exciting option for prime numbers that\u2019s available only to prime numbers, and so they can get their everyday non-bulk items in one box, and we think that\u2019s \u2013 its\u2019 interesting for customers and again it\u2019s great way that we can add the selection and have the selections for those customers. Operator : Moving on to Aram Robinson with Wolfe Research. Aram H. Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the question. On the famous drone interview that Jeff had with Charlie Rose, he said something that caught my attention, which was that every elasticity study that you do says that Amazon should be raising prices. I have two questions around that. The first is does that equation also work in reverse? Meaning that if higher questions don\u2019t dampen demand, does it also mean that lower prices don\u2019t stimulate demand like they used to? Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of pricing, we\u2019ve been very consistent. We want to offer great value to customers, and so I would work very hard to make sure that we can offer and afford to offer great prices for customers. And so, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on in the very hard over the years and that\u2019s certainly one of the reason why you\u2019ve seen the growth rates that we\u2019ve experienced a long with getting close to customers, from the shipping perspective make sure we have great in stocks and other service attributes. In terms of price increases, we certainly have increased the price on Prime, but again that was after many years of not raising the price even though the cost of transportation costs certainly had gone up and the fact that we have certainly added a lot of selection going from little over 1 million items in the first year to over 20 million items. So it\u2019s still an incredibly great value for customers and that\u2019s why we did that. So again, we\u2019re all about making sure we have great values for customers and we\u2019ll continue to that. Aram H. Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay thanks for that. Operator : Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein has the next question. Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you. I have two quick questions about AWS. First, I think everyone would agree that AWS is a vast opportunity. So given how large the opportunity is, why is it that you are not hiring more people, launching more products, and growing faster? What are the limiting factors for growth of AWS? Second, you have a long history of cutting prices for a few specific AWS products, but you did something somewhat unusual in late March when you cut prices across EC2 and S3 products in one shot. Why did you only cut your prices after Google cut theirs? Thank you. Thomas J. Szkutak:   In terms of AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job. We are adding a lot of resources that we\u2019ve grown our employee-based there dramatically over the years and continue to add people there. And that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve been able to launch all the new services that we had over the past several years. And we continued the pace of acceleration in terms of new things that we\u2019re doing is increasing and we\u2019ve published a lot of statistics around that. In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd pricing increase that we had in AWS. Sorry price decrease in AWS and we\u2019re very excited behalf of customers to be able to do that. The team works very hard to able to afford those lower prices and we\u2019re excited to do that. And so in terms of the timing of when we launched these price decreases, they come at different times and that happened to come in the presentation that we\u2019re giving around that time. So but again we\u2019re excited about the opportunity and we\u2019re continuing invest in that business, given the big opportunity that we have there. Operator : Our next question will come from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.:  Can you walk us through the process on how you think about and how you model, how much you\u2019re willing to pay for exclusive content such as video or video game content. And another question, it looks fair for us to assume that the business model of the Kindle Fire TV is similar to what Bezos has said regarding selling other hardware roughly break even and then making money on the F consumer unit. Thanks. Thomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of video content, the team does a very nice job of various modeling, certainly we are trying to estimate what the usages of those of all the content that we\u2019ve launched. And we have a number of different ways if you do that. We do have certainly for some of the content that we have been selling both in terms of physical format as well as selling on the transactional side. We certainly see what the \u2013 what those sales are, what those unit sales are. So we have that as a benchmark, we also have other models to look at that to help us guide to we think the usage that will be those. But again the team has done a nice job and I am looking at different ways to model that. And I expect it will continue to refine that overtime as well. Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: And the Kindle Fire TV. Thomas J. Szkutak: Yes, in terms of Fire TV, I can\u2019t talk about the economics of the device itself. But what I can say is it\u2019s very early and we are extremely pleased with what see and just the few weeks here and the team certainly made we think it\u2019s a killer product and where the team is very hard trying to keep buying stock in their product. Operator : And City\u2019s Mark May have the next question. Mark A. May \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thank you. why don\u2019t you if noticed any change and sign ups or conversions in the few weeks here since you\u2019ve rolled out the prime price increase for new customers and if you could maybe comment on the what may have contributed to the deceleration and year\u2013on-year our growth and media sales in North America. Thanks. Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of prime, it\u2019s early but we are encouraged with what we see so far. Just over the last several weeks, our prime subscribers continue to grow week-over-week. New trials, the adoption of new trials again post the increase are growing very nicely. So those customers accepting new trials is growing very fast. We only have a few days of information related to conversion. And we are encouraged by what we see there. So overall we are very encouraged and the reason why is the customers we believe are responding to just a great service. And so we are continuously being reminded that for customers in terms of the offering we have in the physical side as well as the offerings that we have in the digital side as well. So we are very encouraged there. In terms of the North American media, we did see from a growth standpoint, it\u2019s 13%year-over-year for North American media that compares to 14% in Q1 of last year. It is down a little bit sequentially from Q4 \u2013 Q4 keep in mind we do have video games and video consoles in that number in Q4. And there is certainly number of different factors, but that certainly one that is impacting the Q4 numbers. And it\u2019s certainly seasonal as you would expect that there is some great launches of consoles in Q4 that are impacting that number. Operator :  We\u2019ll now turn to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Great. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, I was just hoping you could give us your view on units growth and how you think about that going forward. How important of a metrics it is because we\u2019re seeing somewhat of a decoupling here as revenue and gross profit reaccelerated, but units obviously (indiscernible) as media came down. Can you talk a little bit about that? Thank you. Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure as you mentioned unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from Q4 and also from last year with 23% year-over-year in Q1. One thing to keep in mind is that our web services business is growing at a faster rate. We don\u2019t incorporate any units from AWS in that metric. But overall, you\u2019re right we continue to \u2013 from a growth standpoint we had a small acceleration of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on local currency basis going from 22% to 23%, we are very pleased with the fundamentals that I talked about earlier that\u2019s impacting that growth rate. So again overall we are pleased and again we think that we see a nice growth rate, and third-party units as a percentage of total units is 40%, which was consistent with what we saw last year so, third-party growth continues to be very strong as well. Operator :  Brian Nowak, SIG has the next question. Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks. I have two. The first one, just Tom to go back to the unit question, even if we exclude North America and international other from gross profit. Gross profit growth held in there pretty steady at 28%. Just kind of curious, is there anything that we should think about of why gross profit growth and unit growth is decoupling? And is unit growth a really good way to measure the health of the business? And then the second one is on international media. One of the factors you guys have flagged in the past holding down international media is more limited local language content. Can you just help us better quantify the difference in English language digital content compared to foreign language? And what steps are you taking to improve that? Thomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of the \u2013 I\u2019ll take the second part of the question first about International media, the growth rate was 4% in the quarter and as I\u2019ve talked about in prior quarters, certainly one of the things that\u2019s happening is we see a conversion from physical to digital. And for example in North-America we are now selling North-America media. We are now selling more digital units than physical units. So over the past twelve months we sold more digital units than physical units. We are not at that point yet in International and so certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us as we look at growing International media. So again, it\u2019s certainly something that we are working very hard on and certainly a good opportunity for us. In terms of unit growth, it\u2019s certainly just one measure that we want to \u2013 that we\u2019ve thought has been helpful. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve continued to provide it. It is just one metric, we have many different metrics that we are sharing. But that much more I can add to that but again it\u2019s a metric, was there a third part of the question. Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP :  No I guess, just are there any other puts and takes we should think about in units as we go throughout the year where there are tough compares or easy compares in units from a digital unit perspective or anything? Thomas J. Szkutak:  It\u2019s not that I can think of at the minute. But just keep in mind when you think about our revenue growth always be thinking about there\u2019s certainly a volume component. We have a third-party component, we have a mix component. We\u2019re continuously trading the lower prices for customers. All those factor into the revenue growth rates that you see into the revenue metrics that we provide to you. Brian T. Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Brian J. Pitz \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Great, thanks. Regarding fulfillment, does it make sense for you to bring some of the components in-house? We\u2019ve been hearing talk of your own fulfillment network. Can you make any comments on this? And just to follow-up on your digital units point, can you comment on any impact of recent shifts in music and video consumption to subscription based models, from download to own on your media business? Is that having any impact? Thanks. Thomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of fulfillment, there\u2019s not a lot I can comment on in terms of your specific question. What I would say though is we continue to work to be, as we have over the years, to become closer and closer to customers. And so, we\u2019ve certainly done that in a number of different ways. Just the footprint we have from a fulfillment capacity standpoint enables us to be closer to customers and getting great selection even closer to customers. So we continue to work. Certainly Prime was another way to get a faster delivery speed to customers and so we\u2019ll continue to work on our capabilities there to make it even better over time. In terms of the digital units question, I apologize. There\u2019s not a lot I can comment in terms of your specific question there. Brian J. Pitz \u2013 Jefferies LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Tom, we look back at your model and we go back to 2008 and 2009. In the middle of a pretty bad global recession, you were able to put up 7.3% and 7.4% operating margins in international. And now it looks like you\u2019re losing money and maybe for the whole year. Could you talk about some of the drivers that are driving the losses this quarter internationally? What the Company\u2019s patience for losses are internationally. And when you come out of this, how your business will be different and what your margin outlook is for the international profits? Thank you. Tom A. Alberg:  Sure. In terms of what you\u2019re seeing in Q1, and you\u2019ve been seeing this certainly for a few year period here is we\u2019ve investing very heavily in international and we\u2019re doing that in a number of different ways. Certainly from a geographic standpoint, we continue to invest in new geographies, and Italy and Spain were certainly the most recent and you should assume that we\u2019re investing in those geographies. We continue to invest in China and certainly that\u2019s in investment mode. And then also as we\u2019ve continue to grow in international, we\u2019ve invested in terms of capacity, both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity to support those. So what you saw \u2013 you will see some certainly variation over time in the period that you\u2019re talking about. We certainly had particularly coming out of \u2013 going into late 2008 and also 2009, we had extra capacity globally. We still did continue to invest, but not near the rates that we\u2019re investing now and that\u2019s why you saw some results that you\u2019ve seen. But again one of the things that you see now in international but in our total results is continue to invest very heavily into the business because of the opportunities that we are seeing. Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Greg Melich with ISI Group. Greg Melich \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC :  Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a bit on the decision process that you went through when raising the Prime membership fee. I know you talked about potentially doing $20 to $40. What factors did you look at in deciding on the $20? And related to that, with the deleveraging of shipment costs happening a little bit, was weather an impact on that or is that just the business and how it\u2019s trending? Thomas J. Szkutak:  There was a number of different factors that we have looked at in terms of when we look at the price increase, but the biggest one is we had build \u2013 we think we build a great service and we saw that the just particularly the transportation cost since its inception have grown dramatically, we just haven\u2019t done any price increase during that long time period, and that\u2019s really the big reason why we decides to do that. We\u2019ve launched the program with over a million items. And we have over 20 million items customers are using that service in addition to having the transportation cost being higher they are using that service more and that\u2019s really we applied to it. And it would be on that, there is a lot we can comment. Greg Melich \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Just on the shipment costs deleveraging in the first quarter a little bit. Did weather or something else have an impact, or is that just the trend of the business given the growth rate of shipments? Thomas J. Szkutak:  This many different factors that go into that and certainly, weather would have been one of those. Operator :  We\u2019ll move on to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ron Victor Josey \u2013:  Hi guys, thanks for taking the question this is Andrew on for Ron. Quick question around streaming volumes in UK and Germany now that Lovefilm is bundled with Prime? Guys you have any comment? JMP Securities LLC :  Hi guys, thanks for taking the question this is Andrew on for Ron. Quick question around streaming volumes in UK and Germany now that Lovefilm is bundled with Prime? Guys you have any comment? Thomas J. Szkutak:  Unfortunately it is probably a good question for future quarters it just so early and again what little data we have so far it\u2019s very encouraging but it is very early so I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a good question for future quarters. Operator :  We\u2019ll move to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Great thanks, obviously a lot of focus on pricing in AWS you are clearly still seeing accelerating growth despite those cuts, could you provide some context on the volume side of that equation whether it\u2019s just growth in customers or workload some way to sort of frame the other side of things outside of just pricing in AWS? Thomas J. Szkutak:  It\u2019s a good question. And I think that something we can certainly work on and tried to be helpful the price change, the most recent price change is certain recent. And what we are commenting on is certainly the Q1 results but \u2013 that something that we\u2019ll think about and that would be helpful on that as we go forward. But certainly usage has been this is not something recent. Usage has been very, very strong. And as we\u2019ve continued to lower prices over time, this is the 42nd price decrease that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019ve had a great usage growth over time. Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And just on the AWS side, with the sort of nationalistic concerns that we\u2019re seeing around stored data, does that change at all the way that the AWS team is thinking about infrastructure needs for that business or the way that you might be thinking about CapEx? Thomas J. Szkutak:  I think the best way to say it is, and hopefully this answers your question. The team focuses on many different aspects, but certainly the operational aspects of being up and running, being a very secure, reliable set of services, those are something the team is very focused on and spends a lot of time working on. And so beyond that, I\u2019m not sure I can add to it. Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald has the next question. Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions please. First, the HBO deal seems like a seminal event for Prime video in terms of quality and probably the price bit as well. Is this the first of many potentially large deals you\u2019re intent on getting for the platform? Or was this more of an opportunistic transaction that just came your way? And second, just on the P&L, can you just clarify where that $60 million in investment gains came from, please? Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure. The answer to your second question, which is down below in other relates to a gain primarily from Living Social. They sold their Korean business and that\u2019s reflected in that line item. In terms of the content question, the way we think about it is this. Since we launched the service we\u2019ve continually added \u2013 tried to add great content and I think we\u2019ve been pretty successful in doing that. And this is just another contract that we\u2019ve launched into this multi-year to do that and we think it\u2019s great for customers. We\u2019re extremely excited to offer this to customers and we\u2019ll try to keep making the service even better over time. Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities :  Is exclusive video an important consideration for you now? Thomas J. Szkutak: There\u2019s a number of factors. Certainly we have a number of different arrangements where we have exclusive content and we think that\u2019s great for customers. We\u2019ve also supplemented with other content that\u2019s not exclusive. And we\u2019re obviously, as you know, we\u2019re working on original content as well. So that is exclusive. So those are the things that we\u2019re working on and we see the customer response to all of those and we like what we see. Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thanks Operator :  Scott Tilghman with B. Riley has the next question. Ronald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Hi Tom, wanted to really ask two related questions. First, following up on the international discussion from before, I was wondering if you could prioritize where the investments are going on the international side between fulfillment, media build out, geography build out, et cetera? And then related, I haven\u2019t seen any discussion on what\u2019s happening on the domestic fulfillment build out this year. I was wondering if you could comment on that as well. Thomas J. Szkutak: Yes, in terms of the priority, I\u2019m not sure what to add there, but I would say that we\u2019re investing heavily in China and we have been for some time and certainly that\u2019s a factor. We\u2019re investing in new geographies, most notably Italy and Spain. We\u2019re investing in, as I mentioned, fulfillment centers and infrastructure to support that growth. So, again, not a lot to add there. The other part of your question? Ronald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC: Well, let me ask you in a different way. If you look at pricing, if you look at infrastructure, if you look at geography, is there one bucket that tends to trump the others? Thomas J. Szkutak: Again we\u2019ve been pretty consistent how we\u2019ve talked about it. Again, China is an issue. China is a big investment. In all of our geographies, not just international, we\u2019re investing on behalf of customers in terms of lowering prices. And so, that\u2019s having an impact, volume is having an impact. We continue to invest in fulfillment capacity not only for our retail customers, but also for third-parties on behalf of fulfillment by Amazon, sort of making investments there and the others that I mentioned. Ronald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC: Fair enough. And on domestic fulfillment? Thomas J. Szkutak: Domestic fulfillment, as we have in past years, we\u2019ll continue to update you as we go throughout the year. I don\u2019t have any comments today given that we\u2019re just coming out of Q1, but we will be adding fulfillment capacity given the growth rates we\u2019re experiencing and we\u2019ll update you as we go. Ronald Scott Tilghman \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll hear from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. A question about your advertising business. There\u2019s been a lot of movement by Google to push PLAs as a product to sellers. I want to know longer term as you guys think about both advertising on Amazon, and also to give out advertising in a way that would allow sellers to bring traffic back to their own websites that might avail themselves of Amazon\u2019s advertising data and user data to help enable those sales. Thank you. Thomas J. Szkutak: I can\u2019t comment on what we might or might not do in the future, but the team has done a nice job from an advertising perspective and you can see those prominently on our various websites. We view it as another way certainly to help, be able to afford lower prices for customers and again the team has done a very nice job of monetizing those detailed pages to allow us to be able to do that. Operator : Moving on to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC :  Thanks, Tom. Two questions, please. The international media you talked about, I guess the digitization catch-up or whatever of international media. Could you break that down a little bit further? Are there certain categories, i.e., books versus videos, versus music that one of those is dragging internationally? And what is it that needs to happen for that digital shift to occur? Do you need more rights? You just need more devices in the market? What\u2019s the drag there? And then, in terms of the operating income guidance you\u2019re very consistent how you guided the last couple of years. It seems like you\u2019re guiding for more of a sequential decline in operating income in June quarter than you have the last two years. Is that just a different type of seasonality to the business, or are there new near-term investments that you\u2019re making in this June quarter? Thank you. Thomas J. Szkutak:  In terms of the second part of the question, related to the guidance what\u2019s reflected in the Q2 guidance is many different factors, but we are investing. I\u2019ve mentioned a number of different investments that we\u2019re making in International which related to Q1, also relate to Q2. We are investing in content, we are investing in our web services business both from new services as well as pricing. So again, we are investing in a lot of different areas across the company. So I\u2019m sure there is a number that I\u2019m not mentioning. So again, we are investing, that\u2019s really which we are seeing in the range of guidance that we see in Q2. In terms of International media, we continue to make progress there on our conversion from physical to digital. But we\u2019re just not where we are in North America. And it\u2019s in many different categories and we\u2019ll continue to work on that. And certainly some other things that you see related to video in Europe, certainly trying to address that part of that. So again, we\u2019ll continue to work on the various pieces of that for our International business and look forward to doing that. Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, Tom. Operator :  Deutsche Bank\u2019s Ross Sandler has the next question. Ross A. Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Hey, guys. If you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ll beat the dead horse on the International question. But specifically around China, can you just give us an update on the overall strategy for China? Are the levels of investments going into the country accelerating or are they just stable? And then what kinds of milestones in terms of market share or customer adoption do you guys track to identify success or return on that investment? Thanks. Thomas J. Szkutak: In China, we are investing a lot and trying to grow the business there. We are certainly investing in fulfillment. We haven\u2019t been investing in our fulfillment network to get even closer to customers. We are doing a lot on the retail basics as we\u2019ve done in other geographies making sure that we have a great in stock availability. We\u2019re making sure that we have [had] a unique selection. So those are the, lot of the things that we\u2019ve done making sure that we have the right pricing in place on behalf of customers making sure that our service levels are where we need them to be. So those are the things that we\u2019d continue to work on in China. It\u2019s a very large opportunity and we are continuing to work hard. Is it a large investment? Yes it is. And that investment has certainly increased over the past several years. Operator :  We\u2019ll now hear from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company. Colin A. Sebastian \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Thanks. First, just one clarification on the AWS question. Given the comments that customers would see hundreds of millions of dollars of savings in Q2 from the price cuts, I just want to understand or clarify if we should be expecting moderating growth rate in the other segments, at least temporarily? And then lastly just Amazon\u2019s position on the ability of ISPs to add a toll for fastlane network access. Is this a scenario a situation that would change the company\u2019s approach or strategy with regards to video or is this more of a non-factor for you guys? Thanks. Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the just clarification and just quote, he mentioned that customers will be saving hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months alone, he didn\u2019t say specifically at the second quarter. So certainly that\u2019s impacting second quarter and it\u2019s reflected in the guidance that you are seeing there. But again we are very happy to do that on behalf of our AWS customers. We\u2019ve done many different price decreases over time and we think that\u2019s great on behalf of customers and we think our teams are and we are positioned very well in that business and we continue to invest in that given the large opportunity that we have there. In terms of the other question, there is not really a lot I can comment there. Operator :  And ladies and gentlemen unfortunately we only have time for one more question which will come from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company. Kerry Rice \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC:  Thanks a lot. Just a couple questions. One on customer adds, you didn\u2019t add quite as many new customer accounts as you did in Q1 2013. And so I assume based on your comments that wasn\u2019t related to the price increase around Prime, and so I don\u2019t know if you can add any context there. And then the second question is just around mobile. Obviously, the mobilization throughout the world is an important trend and you guys haven\u2019t talked a lot about it. Wonder if you can give us any context around your strategy there or any metrics. Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Prime, again over the year-over-year, it is growing very rapidly and then also week-over-week as we look at the metrics over the last several weeks continues to grow week-over-week, so we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing there. In terms of mobile, it\u2019s certainly a tailwind for our business. We have a number of different things that are working on mobile and we continue to make it easier and easier for customers to shop from a mobile perspective. Our traffic continues to increase from a mobile perspective. We are excited about what we see there. And we continue trying to find ways to make that even better from an experience standpoint for our customers. Dave Fildes : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator :  And again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Once again, we do thank you all for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Also, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead, sir. Phil Hardin : Hello and welcome to our Q2 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 24, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Szkutak : Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 18% to $5.33 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.04 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.29 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services. Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 2%, ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 480 million shares compared with 474 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.34 billion or 22% excluding the $237 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $4.84 billion, up 10% or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.28 billion, up 27% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 69% of worldwide sales, up from 66%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 250 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units. Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.4 billion or 69.3% of revenue compared with 71.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.54 billion or 28.6% of sales, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.28 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.2%. Tech and content was $2.02 billion or 10.4% of revenue compared with 9.1%. Marketing was $911 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.1%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $12 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.46 billion or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 29% to $8.37 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 68%. Other revenue grew 38% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $438 million, a 3.7% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.34 billion. Excluding the $246 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 4% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 25% to $4.91 billion or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating loss was $34 million compared to zero in the prior period. CSOI decreased 1% to $404 million or 2.1% of revenue, down approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate, CSOI decreased 9%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $15 million compared to operating income of $79 million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $94 million, and this includes approximately $90 million of discrete tax items primarily attributable to audit-related developments. GAAP net loss was $126 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $7 million and $0.02 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $523 million year-over-year to $7.99 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $6.64 billion, and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.4 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 16% to $10.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 71 from 73 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q3 2014, we expect net sales of between $19.7 billion and $21.5 billion or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 120 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $810 million loss and a $410 million loss compared to a $25 million loss in the third quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $410 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $400 million loss and zero compared to $267 million of income in the third quarter of 2013. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions. Phil Hardin : Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question? Operator : (Operator Instructions) We'll hear first today from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein: Tom, you mentioned in the past that China is an area of investments. Can you say a little bit about what are the main drivers of investment there, whether it's marketing pricing fulfillment? And how do you decide on any given year how much we invest in China, just given the size of the potential market and opportunity? And secondly, we saw a material deceleration in the North America other revenues. Was this primarily driven by AWS deceleration, and is this deceleration a meaningful contributor to the losses implied in your next quarter guidance? Tom Szkutak : Yes, North America other includes a number of things including Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is the largest part of North America other. As we talked about on last call, we had very substantial price reductions for customers starting in second quarter. They ranged from 28% to 51% depending on the service. But AWS continues to grow very strongly. In Q2, we had usage growth close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. So the team is doing a fantastic job. And we put in some price reductions that were very substantial that are saving customers hundreds and millions of dollars over the next several months, as we mentioned 90 days ago. But again, we love that business. It's doing great and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to invest in it. The team is innovating very quickly. In fact, so far year-to-date, they've released 250 significant service and features and that's at a pace that's much, much faster than last year's pace, which was faster than the year before. So again, they're continuing to innovate on behalf of customers. And so we're investing. And so that's certainly impacting both the pricing decisions we've made. They're certainly impacting the guidance. Also, the large amount of CapEx in infrastructure for that business is certainly impacting the guidance along with a number of other things across the business that we're investing in. But we're very pleased to do that. In terms of China, we're continuing to invest on behalf of customers there, obviously trying to make the experience even better for customers in terms of improved in-stock levels. We've certainly added a lot of fulfillment capacity over time in China, and we're doing a lot of interesting things to better serve customers in China. In terms of some of the other parts of your question, there's not much more I can add to that. Operator : We'll hear next from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital. Neil Doshi - CRT Capital : Tom, can you talk a little bit about the deceleration in the units? And then also, in terms of the third-party dollar, it looks like you're trending around 40%. For a while, it ticked up a little bit to 41%. And so if we adjust for digital, how should that trend be looking? Tom Szkutak : In terms of unit growth, we had 23% unit growth year-over-year. It is down from last year's growth rate, but it's consistent with what we've seen recently including the last quarter. And in terms of the third-party units as a percentage of total units, you're right that's 41% this quarter. It's up about 100 basis points. And we're not breaking out the digital versus physical on that. But again, very strong third-party growth, a number of factors, but certainly FBA is helping third-party growth. Operator : And we'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan - UBS: Looking through the expense lines, tech and content seem to have an upward pressure in the quarter. Why don't you maybe give a little more granularity on what was driving that upward pressure and whether that's sort of a new run rate of expense as we saw in the first half of this year? Tom Szkutak : There's a number of things that are going into the tech and content line. But you're right we're the ones that I just mentioned, we are investing in various parts of the business, but certainly for Amazon Web Services, that's both from an infrastructure standpoint to support the very fast usage growth that we're experiencing. Again, we have usage growth close to 90% year-over-year in the second quarter for Web Services. In addition to that, over the past year, we've added thousands of people in Web Services. So again, ramping that up. And then across a number of different other investment areas, we continue to add great technical resources to do the things we're doing in digital and many other parts of the company. So again, we have a lot of opportunities to invest in, as you can see from a lot of the releases that we've had over the past 12 months, and you're certainly seeing that reflected in our actual results as well. Operator : And next from JPMorgan, we'll go to Douglas Anmuth. Kaizad Gotla - JPMorgan: This is Kaizad Gotla for Doug. I was wondering if you could just talk about the deceleration in your international EGM line. And then separately, now that you've had Prime price increases in effect for about three months, wondering if you could just talk about any changes you've seen in sign-ups or conversions there. Tom Szkutak : In terms of international EGM, and this would really related to total international growth as well, we saw 18% growth on a dollar basis, 14% growth on a local currency growth basis. We're just down a little bit sequentially from what we saw in Q1. Obviously there's variability from quarter-to-quarter in each of the geographies that we operate in. One call-out which impacted certainly EGM and our total international growth rate is Japan. We saw on April 1st, the consumption tax was increased from 5% to 8%. Leading up to that in the latter part of Q1, we certainly saw accelerated growth, so that was reflected in the Q1 results. In Q2, we saw some corresponding softness in Q2 following that. Hard to know how much was related to consumption growth, but certainly as you've probably read elsewhere that others are seeing that too. So it probably reflects the consumption tax increase. But if you take out Japan out of both Q1 and Q2, the growth rates on a local currency basis were very similar within approximately 100 basis points of each other. In terms of Prime, Prime subscribers are growing very nicely year-over-year. In fact, we had more Prime subscribers in Q2 of this year than in Q2 of last year. So we're very pleased and we continue to get new subscribers as well as existing customers responding to the great value they're getting out of Prime. Operator : And from Citi, we'll go to Mark May. Mark May - Citi: Based on sort of what you've talked about in the disclosures around the price, the amount of the price decreases, the common sense would suggest that all if not most of the CSOI margin decline that you posted in Q2 year-on-year is related to the AWS price changes. And the common sense would also suggest that given the significant volume gains that you're seeing in that business that Q2 might be the most impacted quarter from that yet. The third quarter guidance suggests that it's having an even greater impact on Q3. Just wondering if you could help us think through that. Is there some timing issue related to the impact of that, or is there something else going on within the core retail business or maybe some other one-time items that might be impacting your Q3 outlook? Tom Szkutak : We're not quantifying the impact of the price changes on our Q2 and Q3, but it is fair to say that it certainly did impact our Q2 results in a meaningful way. And that's reflected in the results that you're seeing. Another thing to keep in mind as you look out related to AWS is we're continuing to invest in that business. And with the great strong usage growth rates that we're seeing, we're also investing in CapEx and infrastructure to support that growth. So again, the team has done a fantastic job innovating on behalf of customers. And as I mentioned earlier, the new releases both from a service and feature perspective was about 250 year-to-date, which is at a pace that's much faster than we've seen over the last few years with very high bar, given all the innovation that's happened from that team in that space. So again, there are certainly things that are impacting Q3 guidance. There's a number of other things. When you look at Q3, keep in mind if you look back over the last several years, we're getting ready for Q4 seasonal quarter. And when that happens, if you look back, certainly you've seen our CSOI usually has been at the lowest point for the year during Q3, particularly during these high growth years. And so we've announced that we're adding six net new fulfillment centers. And we've also announced that we'll have 15 or more sortation centers. The sortation centers help us get closer to customers, so that we can have fastest delivery speed as well as deliver on Sundays, which is a big deal for us in the US. So we're very pleased to be able to do that. On top of that, other investment areas that are certainly impacting our Q3 guidance is we like what we see on the content side. So video content, for example, we're ramping up the spend from Q2 to Q3 significantly. And so it'll be also a significant growth year-over-year. Keep in mind we have two types of content. We have license content. We also have original content. A lot of you have probably seen a lot of the announcements that we've green-lighted a number of pilots. We're going to be in heavy production in those series that have been green-lit during Q3. We've also announced a number of pilots that will be in production on. And so that original content, it's a portion of our total content, will be over $100 million in Q3. Just as a reminder, we do not capitalize that portion of our original content. Its expense is incurred. So that's over $100 million in Q3. And again, that's ramped up considerably both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis. Other areas that we're investing in, certainly with the launch of some new devices more recently over the past couple of quarters between Fire Phone and Fire TV and others, over time we've invested in devices. So that's certainly an area we're investing in. We're investing in a lot of different areas including geographic expansion. We talked about China on one of the earlier questions. But certainly India, we're investing very heavily. We're seeing some very positive results there. The team is doing a fantastic job. We're also investing in other geographies as well, Italy and Spain and others. So again, we're encouraged by just the sheer magnitude of opportunities we have and we're investing in those opportunities. Operator : We'll move next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Brian Pitz - Jefferies: First question on FBA. Any insights on the penetration of third-party sellers using FBA. Maybe you could comment just directionally? Is the number trending up or down? And separately, it's been less than a week, but can you comment on early feedback to Kindle Unlimited by customers and publishers? Do you expect this to be the model for digital book consumption in the future? Tom Szkutak : In terms of FBA, it's doing great. I can't provide a specific percent. But it's really since the time we've launched continued to increase as a percentage of total third-party units. And so the service has done very well. The team continues to work on making it even better on behalf of sellers and customers. In terms of Kindle Unlimited, it's very early, but we're extremely pleased with what we see. There's been a great reaction to it. And we're pleased to offer that to customers. Operator : Moving next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs : You mentioned that you were happy with the results that you're seeing from the video content. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of sort of how that manifests itself, whether it's more Prime subscribers, whether it's more consumption of downloadable video content within the ecosystem. And then, Tom, to the extent that you're talking about sort of AWS volume increases on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a sense of how that may have trended over the course of the quarter as your AWS customers were able to sort of adapt to the price reduction in March? Tom Szkutak : In terms of content, we've seen just more and more customers are streaming, more and more Prime members are streaming free content. We're seeing through our pipeline as customers join Prime, we're seeing that we have more and more customers taking free trials and then converting. Those customers are great customers. In addition to streaming free content, they have great purchasing patterns, doing a lot of cross-shopping on physical products as well as converting to paid digital video and other digital products as well. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. And when you look at the service that we have today, it's improved dramatically over the past 12 to 24 months. And we really think it's a great service and that's why we're investing in it. In terms of AWS, there's not much I can help you with on that. But again, just to reiterate, we saw very strong growth during Q2 with usage growth rates close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. And we're extremely happy with what we see there, and the team has done a fantastic job, continue to innovate on behalf of customers. Operator : We'll hear next from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. John Blackledge - Cowen & Company: Just a couple of question, first on AWS. Just wondering your take on the competitive environment in public cloud, has it intensified over the past six to 12 months, just given the investments in AWS? How do you view AWS's competitive positioning? And then if you could just touch on the key drivers of EGM growth in North America, and are those the same drivers of growth internationally or are there different drivers North America versus international? Tom Szkutak : They work hard to be able to afford lower prices for customers. That's something that is instilled in all of Amazon and something certainly is instilled in our Web Services team. And their folks on what they do best, which is innovating on behalf of customers, operating these services at the highest quality levels, and they continue to work on getting more efficient, so that we can have great prices for customers. And so that's a team that's focused and they're doing a great job. In terms of EGM growth between North America and international, there's not a lot I can call out there. It has many different categories across many different geographies, many different ASINs both first party and third party. So it's hard to comment. The only thing I would call for attention is the comment I made earlier around international growth rates related to EGM, and that was the consumption tax increase in Japan that we saw a lead in Q1 where we saw very strong growth leading up to that point and it softened after the rates went into effect. But other than that, there's not a lot to call out. Operator : We'll now go to Macquarie's Ben Schachter. Ben Schachter - Macquarie: When you mentioned that AWS is growing 90% year-over-year, what exactly is growing 90%? Is it storage? Is it something else? And then on the phone itself, are there any key differences in how we should be thinking about that piece of hardware versus other hardware you've done in the past where Jeff has discussed the notion of potentially one to breakeven? And then just a follow-up on that. How are you modeling the impact of the phone on the P&L in 3Q? Is it going to be more or less than the original content initiative? Tom Szkutak : In terms of AWS, it's really aggregation of usage across all of our services year-over-year. Think of it as almost a proxy similar to unit growth on our retail business. It's a proxy to say how fast the physical volume is growing. And so that's what it's a proxy for. In terms of the phone, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. We're extremely pleased to get it in customers' hands. We think it's a premium product. You get a 32 gigabyte phone, premium product, one-year free subscription to Prime along with all the other features that I'm sure you've read about. So again, we're very pleased to get it to customers and start shipping. And customers have started to receive those today. Operator : And from William Blair, we'll go to Mark Miller. Mark Miller - William Blair : Many investments, it looks like where you are getting a return is in the gross margin. If I take out AWS, it looks like you're up nearly 200 basis points. What are the drivers of that e-commerce margin increase? Are you seeing it primarily on the first-party margin expansion? And if so, why? And how much is coming from third-party unit increase? Tom Szkutak : We don't actually focus on total company gross margins because of the mix of the business. We focus more on operating profit and obviously ultimately free cash flow dollars. But in terms of things that would be impacting COGS as a percentage of revenue and that change, to be helpful, you mentioned AWS is certainly having an impact there. Our third-party business continues to have an impact there. We have offsets as we lower prices to customers, having an impact there. Just mix of various products and geographies has an impact on those results. Again, a large number of items that are impacting that. Operator : And Justin Post with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch has our next question. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Tom, there might be a little bit of a disconnect. When we see prior investment cycles such as distribution builds out or devices with, say, the Kindle reader, we did see an impact on units and accelerating growth in some of the categories. This time around, even investing for a couple of years and I guess we're not really seeing the acceleration. So maybe you could talk about what gives you confidence in investing in devices like the Fire TV and the phone and all the content you're doing? And are you seeing some underlying signs, let's say, activities picking up? Maybe you could walk through that. Tom Szkutak : Just a couple of things to call out. One is when we look at our unit growth, you hear the 23% unit growth, keep in mind that there're parts of our business that are not included in that unit growth. So when we talk about investing in Web Services and the usage growing close to 90%, that number is not included in the 23%. So that's obviously a large investment area for us that we're excited about that is not included in that. The other is think about the base of business that we have versus where we were just a few years ago. And so you've seen very strong growth on the base that we have. And we're excited to see that. When we look at the opportunities that we're investing in, in terms of video, you mentioned, we're seeing that certainly in the number of Prime members that are subscribing. And so that has some short-term impact, the great long-term impact as we retain those Prime members and as they start to do more cross-shopping over time. We have a lot of investment in front of that demand, if you will. So those are some of the things that I would call out to be try to be helpful. Operator : We'll move now to Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald : Going back to $100 million spend on the original content, you mentioned earlier as that part of the business grows, is there any reason to believe that the amount of spend on the originals will go down? The assumption here is it'll only go up. So is that $100 million a good level to work off of? And then going back to the Fire Phone, just trying to understand the strategy around the product longer term. Is it again just to try to further build the Amazon ecosystem with all the benefits or do you think this could be a cell phone of the business? Tom Szkutak : In terms of the original content, we're not giving guidance on the numbers going forward and beyond Q3. We're very excited about what we see and the pilots we had and the series we had. And so we're very happy to green-light the series that we've talked about and released over the past few months. We're also happy you'll be seeing many new pilots. And so that's reflected in the over $100 million that I mentioned earlier. So we're extremely excited on behalf of customers to be able to do that, and we think that's a great thing to do. But in terms of what we do in terms of spend beyond Q3, can't comment on today. In terms of the Fire Phone, we're very excited about it. You mentioned two different areas. One is can it exist on its own and whether it's part of our family, if you will, to help drive other usage. And the answer is we certainly think it can be both. So we think it could be a great product on its own. We're very excited to offer it to customers. It's very integrated into our various digital services including video and games and our app store and ebooks and certainly Prime music. So those are all very interesting things on behalf of customers. It's also a great way to do physical shopping as well. So again, it's certainly integrated into our business as well. Operator : And Brian Nowak with SIG has our next question. Brian Nowak - SIG: The first one is around CPG, consumer packaged goods, I was wondering, Tom, can you talk to us some learnings in CPG so far, what's working and what you think is still holding back faster CPG adoption? Do you think you need a same-day delivering offering at this point for CPG kind of given Google and even the traditional retailers push into that category? And then the second one, the close to 90% AWS usage growth, just help us understand a bit more, what did that number look like in 2013? Tom Szkutak : Yeah, in terms of the usage growth, the business is growing very, very fast beyond the data point. There's not a lot I can help you with. In terms of CPG, and this really relates to many of our categories, we're working on behalf of customers to provide fast delivery. It's something that we've improved on over the years and we're going to continue to work on. There's a number of different things we're working on. One of the things that I mentioned early in the call is certainly sortation centers. That's an attempt on our side. We have in a small way and tested it and we've seen that it's a way to get product to customers even faster. So we're excited about that. It also helps deliver on Sunday, which we think is great too. So again, those are the things that we're working on as well as others to help customers get product faster. And we think that benefits CPG products as well other products. Operator : We'll move next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets : I wanted to follow up on that William Blair question about gross margins only because I know you don't focus on and there're a lot of mix factors that you correctly pointed out. But that's a record high gross margin for you, 30.7%, ever. And it's in the context of a quarter in which AWS clearly came in because of the price cuts. And so there's something else that happened there that really caused that gross margin to gap up. Could you give us any color? I understand there're a lot of puts and takes in there. But something must have happened that was unusual to have that kind of result with a slowing down AWS contribution. Tom Szkutak : We don't focus a lot on gross margin of the business. Obviously unusual product lines, we would look at gross margin. But across the business, we don't for the very reason you mentioned. There's a large mix impact. You have our Web Services business. You have our third-party business. You have the retail business. You have categories within retail. There's a whole host of things that would impact that. And so that's why we don't focus on a total company basis. Certainly on individual SKUs or ASINs, as we call them, we certainly would look at it. Individual sub-categories, we would certainly look at it internally. But from a total company perspective, given the mix effects, we think it's much more appropriate to look at operating profit and free cash flow. Operator : And from ISI Group, we'll go to Greg Melich. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Looked like revenue per active customer accelerated again this quarter, up over 5%. It was running closer to 2% to 3% last year. Could you help us understand what's driving that, whether it's Prime particularly, or any color on that? And when you gave the Prime numbers second quarter more sign-ups whether that was a grosser in that number? Tom Szkutak : The Prime, it was a net number. So that's the net additions to total members. So again, we added net more Prime members in Q2 of this year versus Q2 last year, even with the price change. In terms of revenue per active customer, there's not a lot I can say there. A few things to think about, one is certainly Prime customers buy more than non-Prime customers. And we're seeing great growth on Prime. That's certainly having an impact on that number. And certainly there'll be other factors too. Our Web Services business would be included in the numerator that you're talking about as well. And so those are factors you should be thinking about. But again, the biggest factor would certainly be in terms of looking at our retail business, Prime is becoming much more meaningful. And that's also why we think about how do we make Prime better on behalf of those customers. We just like the long-term benefits that we see for those customers. Operator : And our final question today will be from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company. Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird & Company: One of your executives in the UK recently mentioned the company's goal of reaching 1 billion different products available for sale on the site. I wonder if there is an expansion in selection beyond what we've seen recently that could help accelerate growth. And related to that, are you still relatively agnostic in terms of the split between first and third-party unit sales? Tom Szkutak : In terms of selection, I would say nothing is new here. We're going to continue to add unique selection. That's something that we've been working extremely hard day-in and day-out over many years. We have a great team of people working on that and trying to make sure we get a vast selection. So that's something that we're pleased about. In terms of the margins, they do approximate each other. Obviously there's some differences. Some of the third-party will be used products. And you shouldn't assume that a used product necessarily has the same contribution profit per unit as a new unit, things like that. But they're close approximates of those. Phil Hardin : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining us.",

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2014 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead. Phil Hardin : Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 23, 2014 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Szkutak : Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 15% to $5.71 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.63 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operation. Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 3%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 481 million shares compared with 475 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $20.58 billion or 20% excluding the $13 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.24 billion, up 4% or 4% excluding exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.95 billion, up 26% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 68% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 21%. Active customer accounts was approximately 260 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 42% of paid units. Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.63 billion or 71.1% of revenue compared with 72.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $6.09 billion or 29.6% of sales, up approximately 350 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.55 billion or 12.4% of revenue compared with 11.5%. Tech and content was $2.22 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $961 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 3.9%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 25% to $12.87 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.73 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $8.79 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 40% to $1.34 billion. North America segment operating income decreased 70% to $88 million, a 0.7% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 14% to $7.71 billion. Excluding the $21 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 13%. Media revenue grew 4% to $2.51 billion or 3% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 20% to $5.16 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 64%. International segment operating loss was $224 million compared to international segment operating loss of $28 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss was $136 million compared to consolidated segment operating income of $267 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss includes charges of approximately $170 million, primarily related to the Fire phone inventory evaluation and supplier commitment cost. Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $544 million compared to operating loss of $25 million in the prior period. Our income tax benefit was $205 million, GAAP net loss was $437 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $41 million and $0.09 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $806 million year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $7.32 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $11.81 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 75 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlement, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they\u2019ve been recently. For Q4 2014, we expect net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion or growth between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $570 million loss and $430 million income compared to $510 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $470 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense to be between $100 million loss and $900 million in income compared to $876 million in income in the fourth quarter of 2013. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareowners. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions. Phil Hardin : Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from analyst Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Brian Pitz - Jefferies: Great thanks. Two quick questions. Can you provide any color on the consumer over this year's back-to-school season and how do you view the outlook for the consumer as we head into the holidays? And then separately you recently closed the acquisition of Twitch last month. Can you help us understand where does Twitch fit into your overall digital content strategy? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Sure, in terms of back-to-school, certainly the results are reflected in the Q3 results that you see today. There's a number of different impacts back-to-school has. One thing I would like to call out, as you look at our North American media growth rates one thing that we are seeing is certainly a shift from a text book standpoint from purchase to rental and so we see a lot more customers renting. So you see that impacting the growth rate a bit the North American media. But in terms of Q4 as in any Q4, when we look at it, there is a wide range of outcomes. We're giving a wide range of guidance. What we feel good about is we have a team that's been improving customer experience over the past twelve months. We're very excited to serve customers. We've had a lot of unique selection. We've got inventory closer to the customers. Many, many different things that we're doing on behalf of customers. So we are very excited about the holiday season and look forward to serving customers. In terms of Twitch, we're very excited to have Twitch as part of our overall team. We've been in video games for quite some time and we think that it's a very creative team. They're doing some very innovative things on behalf of their customers and our customers and so we're excited to have them, be part of Amazon and look forward to working together with that team. Brian Pitz - Jefferies: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Carlos Kirjner analyst with Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein: Thank you for taking my question. Two if I may. International CSOI margin this quarter were the lowest they have been in years, maybe ever, I don\u2019t know. We know you have been investing internationally but has something changed fundamentally and if yes, what? Secondly, I wanted to ask you about vast difference in revenue growth rate between your international and domestic business. What is fundamentally different between the U.S. and your main international markets and is this difference fundamental or temporary? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Thank you. Thanks for the question. In terms of the consolidated segment or the segment operating income, excuse me, for international, certainly versus what you'd have seen last quarter some notable changes, one is we're certainly getting ready for the holiday season, so as to get ready for the holiday season. We are expanding from a capacity standpoint. We do see -- we've gotten great penetration and Fulfilled by Amazon customers. So you'll see that actually our growth rate -- unit growth rate is actually higher than our revenue growth rate and so that's what we've been experiencing so certainly adding capacity from a fulfillment perspective, adding capacity from a infrastructure standpoint. If you look at our overall operating expenses, we are certainly investing and with the slower growth rate you're not seeing as -- certainly not seeing as much leverage. We understand that we do have to get leverage over time, but we are investing right now. We're also investing in newer emerging geographies including India and Italy and Spain and continue to invest in China.  And then one other call out, we -- mentioned in my opening remarks there was approximately $170 million impact related to inventory evaluation and supplier commitment costs, a vast majority of that was in North America, but there was about $25 million in international just to let you know that that's there. In terms of the growth rate, it has been softer across a number of geographies. If you look back over the past really four quarters, we've seen a little bit of volatility between the quarters, but it's been softer. We continue to focus on the inputs and we still think international is a very big opportunity for us in terms of growth. More recently if you look at the growth rate for Q3 and you see the 13% excluding foreign exchange, you may remember on the last call about 90 days ago, I talked about Q2 what had happened was we had seen -- in late Q1 we had seen a ramp up in Japan before the consumption tax increase happened on April 1. We saw a pretty sizable drop off in Japan growth rates from Q1 to Q2, which brought that down. The only update again is the number of different puts and takes by geographies, but the only other comment I would say is that we really haven\u2019t seen Japan growth rates improving since Q2. So that's something that's there. But in terms of the fundamentals, long term we're very excited about international as well as North America. We think it's a big opportunity. We continue to focus on the inputs. Some of those inputs are certainly on the media side working on the conversion from physical media to digital media. We continue to work on that in a number of different ways. We continue to add new selection in those geographies and work on the retail basics and so again we're very excited about the opportunity. Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next call will come from analyst Scott Devitt with Stifel. Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus : Hey Tom, thanks. I had a question just broadly. A lot of the capital that's been deployed in terms of planting seeds and new businesses have worked out very well, but given what's happening right now in terms of the deterioration in the margin structure as growth is slowing, I am just wondering and I think a lot of investors have this question as well and in terms of when things don't go as anticipated in some of the bigger projects where there is not a revenue stream like areas maybe like some of the hardware projects and China and other markets, what's the process for determining whether to plough ahead or turn back capital and redeploy in another areas. Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Thanks for the question Scott. With anything new that we do and obviously we've done -- as you mentioned we've done a lot of new things. There is certainly a wide range of outcome and we certainly understand that. We try to learn from everything that we do as we launch new opportunities and so that's something across things that go great and things that don't go as well as others. We try to learn from that. And so the way I will describe it is from a looking forward standpoint we still think that we have a lot of opportunities. That said, we need to be very selective about what opportunities we pursue and so that's again the way we're thinking about it and probably not much more I can add to it than that. Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure. Operator : And we'll continue on to analyst Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets : Two questions please. That $170 million in charges related to the Fire phone, where was that put in the P&L and which are the OpEx lines or was it a COGS? And then secondly on the media side, you talked about maybe seeing a negative impact or definitely seeing a negative impact from the switch towards owning to renting. Do you think that's a broader trend beyond just text books that affects all media retailers including Amazon? Could that have been -- could that be one of the issues behind the slow media growth in international markets and if so, is there really a solution to that other than your own rental -- your own rental models? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure. In terms of the first question, the $170 million, it's predominately in COGS and so it's the very vast majority than COGS and then in terms of the split about 25 million is in international and the remainder is in North America. In terms of the growth, we certainly are seeing that in text books. We do see another - digital media, we're certainly seeing rentals being part for our portfolio more than we had probably during - certainly with physical, but in terms of some of the recent growth rates, the one that I called out related to book rentals are certainly impacting North American media. One of the other things that\u2019s certainly impacting it too is we did had some things last year Q3 that were overlapping, that were positive in Q3 last year from a demand standpoint. One was certainly in physical books we had very heavy discounting, which helped our growth in Q3 last year. We're overlapping that in Q3 this year. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks Tom. Tom Szkutak : Thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you. We'll now go to analyst Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Hey there and thanks for taking my question. Hoping we can go back to square one here if you don't mind, can you tell us or remind us what financial measures are important to you guys and which financial measures do you hold yourselves and the Board hold you accountable to because it's a little hard to see any of them making positive progress, so I just would love to get back to basics? Tom Szkutak : Sure, we're looking at a number of different metrics over a long period of time and certainly where our goal is to maximize free cash flow over the long term, we don't focus on individual margins, but we do focus on the inputs that are going to help drive free cash flow and operating income. We certainly will look at making sure that we're using our capital wisely so that over time we get good returns on invested capital and we certainly have been in several years now of what I would call an investment mode and because of the opportunities that we had in front of us. And as I mentioned earlier there is still lots of opportunity in front of us and -- but we know that we have to be very selective about which opportunities we pursue and -- but we're encouraged by the opportunities that we have. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : So cash flow and return on invested capital is where we should keep our attention. Tom Szkutak : Yes. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Okay. And are the employees in the recruiting side, is that becoming more difficult as the stocks has [faded] [ph] a little bit and those return characteristics have [faded] [ph], how are you making sure that you're hiring the best people? Tom Szkutak : We have -- we have processes in place to make sure that we have a very high bar on the hiring that we do, the people that we're hiring are extraordinarily talented. We're very fortunate to get to work with so many talented people here and we've been fortunate to be able to grow that employment base to work on the opportunities that we have. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to analyst Colin Gillis with BGC Financial. Colin Gillis - BGC Financial : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So just to get back to that North American media sales, what's the lowest growth rate in over 20 years -- are there \u2013 or 20 quarters, are there other factors beyond the text book shifts and sort of the Q3 strength last year? Are the digital media trends still intact? Tom Szkutak : In terms of the principal drivers -- it's the two that I mentioned. So it's the text books rentals and also overlapping some of the strong discounting and strong titles that we had in some categories. So it's across a number of categories within media, but those are the two principle drivers. Colin Gillis - BGC Financial : And you don't see this as a broader shift in that number? Tom Szkutak : No, we're -- there's still both in terms of North America and international, there is certainly a shift that's going on from physical to digital and that's something that we're spending a lot of time on and trying to improve the experience for customers and we've been able to do that certainly over a period of time and so it's something we'll continue to work on. Colin Gillis - BGC Financial : Okay. Great. Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And we'll continue on to analyst Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ron Josey - JMP Securities : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two please. If you could update us on this rotation center rollout, are all 15 online, and I would love to know maybe how they\u2019ve helped bridge the last mile and improve overall speed delivery. And then the second question, sort of switching gears and just focusing on advertising, I believe a pilot was launched or beta was launched for Amazon's ad network called CPM Ads I think maybe last August. I am wondering if you can provide some commentary there. Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure, in terms of the sort centers, we'll have over 15 sort centers in the U.S. by the end of the year. It's certainly helping us a lot. We have same day delivery in 12 cities. We'll have Sunday delivery in approximately 50% of the population and so we're pleased to do that. And in terms of the ad network, there is a not a lot I can say there. Ron Josey - JMP Securities : Okay. Thank you very much. Tom Szkutak : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Aaron Kessler - Raymond James : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us an update maybe on your views on original programming? It looked like Transparents had some good success. Also just from an international standpoint your views or may be the growth in China, India as well, are you seeing any -- signs of any increasing competition in the international, your key international markets today? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure. In terms of our original content, we're excited about it. We're investing as we talked about. Last quarter we spent approximately $100 million in the quarter. Keep in mind that that's expensed in the quarter and so that's included in the results that you see in Q3. We're very excited about it. We have a number of pilots as well as a number of series launched. Transparent you mentioned is one of them. It's gotten very good reviews. The streaming on that series has been great. So we're very excited about it and we think it's an interesting area for customers. We continue to invest heavily in video content including originals and there is a number of different metrics we're looking at certainly from a prime standpoint, but what we're seeing so far are those customers who are streaming are renewing at considerably higher rates at considerably higher rates at a rate that's already high. So we like what we see there. When customers come in for new trials and they -- free trials and they engage from a video content standpoint, we see the conversion being higher. So we see that we're adding new prime members as a result of that and when those prime members, when those new prime members become prime members, the other thing we're seeing is they're buying physical product, which is a great impact for us. We see very similar patterns in terms of how much physical product that they're purchasing from us and so we're still certainly in investment mode there, but we like what we see and we have a long way to go there, but we're concentrating on building great service and we see that customers are rewarding us with engagement on the content, both original and licensed and they're buying more from us on the physical side and becoming prime members when they do and have been doing at higher rates. So those are the some of the early signs and we will continue to monitor very closely, but we're excited about what we're seeing there. In terms of some of the international comments and I would say this for not just international, but I would say it for the U.S. as well, one thing that's not new is it's a very competitive environment. We have a lot of competitors both online and offline. That's not anything that's new. We used to operate in that environment. We've been in that environment for really for 19 years and so -- but we're seeing a lot of competition and again that's not new. Aaron Kessler - Raymond James : Great. Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our nest question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks. Last quarter you mentioned that the AWS business saw a 90% increase in volume. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you\u2019ve seen so far this quarter. And then in the highlight section of the release, the first six bullet points or so that you have there are all related to the hardware side of the business. if you can just sort of give us now that you have a little bit more time on the hardware side of the business, but behind if you can give us a sense of what you're learning in this category and where you think Amazon's long term position in hardware is ultimately going to be. Tom Szkutak : In terms of AWS, we're -- we saw a very good growth in Q3 as well. From a usage standpoint it's very similar to Q2, close to 90% and so the team is doing just a fantastic job. You can see our other revenue in North America went up a little bit sequentially and AWS is certainly the largest piece of that and is the vast majority of it and they're growing at a faster rate than that other line item. So again the team is doing a fantastic job and not only serving customers, but launching many, many new features and services and you can see some of the detail on that in the Highlight section of our release today. So we're very excited about it. In terms of devices, I can't speculate what we would do going forward, but we just launched a number of new tablets and e-readers that were excited about and there is some really great price point for customers on the tablet side. We also launched a kid's tablet which is the first time we've launched. We've launched some new kindles including our premium kindle and it's a terrific product. We think it's the best kindle we've made to date for sure and so we're very excited about that. And we're excited to have these offerings for customers. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research. Ben Schachter - Macquarie: Hi Tom. You mentioned that you need to get leverage at some point. In the last call you also said something similar, but can you help us quantify the timing that in your internal modeling when do you expect to see more meaningful leverage and when you look at your three to five year's outlook, what does your leverage picture look like there and then also can you remind us of what your philosophy of stock buybacks is and what would it take to get you back in the market, thanks? Tom Szkutak : In terms of leverage, beyond the guidance that we're giving today, there is not a lot of certainly I can give you, but again what I had mentioned earlier is we do have a lot of opportunities, but our job is to be judicious and selective about what opportunities we pursue. And so that's the way we're thinking about it and I apologize I can't give you any more certainty in terms of timing, but certainly that's the way we're thinking about it. And in terms of buybacks, we haven\u2019t opened buybacks right now. We have authorization to do that. I certainly can't comment on what price points we would or wouldn\u2019t do there. Operator : Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. If you look at the phone impact in Q3, it seems to explain some of the difference versus the Street, but when you look forward to Q4, it looks like you\u2019re guiding to about 15% to 16% growth ex FX and again profits maybe below some expectations. Is the phone having an impact on profits in Q4 as well? And also when you think about the Q4 guidance are there any events or things you want to call out? Are you being especially conservative in Q4 giving recent trends? Anything different this year on holiday? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Yes. In terms of the holiday season just and if you look back the last several years, I've been giving wide ranges because it\u2019s again a more seasonal quarter, always challenging to predict precisely where we're going to be. So in terms of a dollar range I gave us $3 billion range last year. I am giving a $3 billion range again this year from a revenue perspective again wide range. At the higher end of the range, excluding foreign exchange, it's approximately 21%. So it's a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3 and then you can see we're on the low end of the range. In terms of -- but in terms of the season itself, we're very excited about it. And in terms of to serve customers, we feel great about the selection that we have added and are continuing to add for the holiday season. We think from an operations standpoint each year we try to get better and we believe we'll be even better this year than we have had in previous years. And so we are super excited to serve customers. In terms of the phone, the only other thing that I can comment on is at the end of Q3, we had approximately $83 million worth of inventory on hand. And so I can't comment on how that would impact guidance or not, but that's the amount of inventory we had on hand at the end of Q3. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next analyst will be John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. John Blackledge - Cowen & Company: Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. We saw that Amazon Fresh expanded into Brooklyn recently. Just wondering if we can discuss your decision to expand into New York City and how we should think about timings for expansion into other markets and then if you can update us on the number of fulfillment centers globally and in the year that would be great. Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure, in terms of the number of fulfillment centers it's 13 net for the year and then on as I mentioned earlier in the U.S. we'll have 15 sort centers by the end of more than 14, excuse me, more than 15 sort centers by the end of the year. In terms of, sorry the other part of the question was on Fresh, the team is doing a great job from a customer experience standpoint. As you can see we're in a few cities. Today, the team is just heads down focused on making sure that experience is great for customers. We continue -- customers like the service. So we're seeing good pick up there and as you mentioned, we're expanding in the Brooklyn. I can't speculate on what we do beyond the cities that we have launched today, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan - UBS: Thanks for taking the question. Tom you guys put thorough a price increase on the prime services here. Was curious what you were seeing in terms of the impact of that price increase on both the rate of adding people into Prime and the ability to control churn inside the Prime subscription base in general. And as you add additional functionality and layers into Prime like you\u2019ve done this year through the investments, whether you\u2019ve thought about maybe put in another price increase through next year. Thanks. Tom Szkutak : In terms of what we do going forward it certainly wouldn\u2019t speculate. We had a price point since our initiation of, excuse me, since the launch of Prime. Its $79 and so it took us long time and we were very careful with that to increase it to $99. But since we've increased to $99 we've had -- we've had great retention. We're very pleased with the -- the retention we've had from customers. The program is growing very fast. We're very excited about it and so we do think it's really good for customers and it\u2019s really good for us and shareowners over the long term. You're correct in that we're investing in Prime in a number of different ways including video content as I talked about earlier that is certainly the way we'll get a return on that investment. Principally will be customers buying more including and especially physical products. So again we're very excited about Prime globally. Operator : Thank you. Our next analyst will be Brian Nowak with SIG. Brian Nowak - SIG: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two please. The first one, fulfillment ex stock based comp was the highest it's ever been as a percentage of gross profit in the third quarter, can you just talk about the drivers of that? Is that for rotations centers or international growth, what's driving that? And then as we think about this rotation centers, what's the impact of those over the next few quarters to fulfillment? Are they do they take a while to kind of get the inefficiencies out of the system like a standard DC would? Tom Szkutak : Yes, in terms of fulfillment cost, you're right. Again we're adding 13 net fulfillment centers where we added -- we'll have over 15 sort centers at the end of the year. certainly one of the drivers for that is certainly the growth that we are experiencing, but in addition to that, what we're seeing is the FBA adoption continues to get better and if we get further penetrated with sellers adopting full by Amazon, we think that's really good for sellers and for us and for customers over the long term. And what you're seeing is we're several years ago in terms of performance center planning we were adding less of them and it was much closer to the holiday season. With the sheer amount of capacity that we're adding, you're seeing more of that come in even before Q4. So you're seeing that impacting us earlier and the benefit of coming in earlier is we get to serve customer and get up to the productivity rates that we want to, to serve customers in Q4, by having that capacity in a bit earlier than in the past. So you\u2019ve seen that trend happen over the past few years with that coming in earlier than certainly historically we've been able to do. Brian Nowak - SIG: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next analyst will be Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo. Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo : Thanks so much for taking my questions. First Prime launched a referral fee recently and I am wondering if we should take that as any indication that the membership growth has slowed or you're seeing some higher churn and how does that referral fee get accounted for. And then secondly, Target launched free shipping with no hurdle for the holidays versus your $35 hurdle, I am just wondering what your willingness is to leave that competitive gap during the holidays, thanks. Tom Szkutak : Yes, can't comment from a competitive standpoint what we might or might do there, but in terms of the Prime referral fee, no, you should not read into that that Prime isn\u2019t growing well and in fact just the opposite. We\u2019re seeing great growth and we like the fact that enabling customers because they like Prime to be able to refer others we think is great for us and so I can't actually maybe offline you can follow-up with Phil or Dave on the accounting. Top of my head, I can't remember how that's working, but I know they will be able to answer it for you. Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of follow-ups. First off in terms of the Q4 revenue guide, are you giving any consideration to that forecast to some of the shipping issues that happened last holiday and the ability of your shipping partners to manage your growth. And then secondly on paid units, can you provide a splits or color between physical and digital unit growth. Thanks. Tom Szkutak : In terms of -- in terms of the guidance it reflects all of the assumptions that we think could happen for the quarter. So again it's a wide range to speak specifically to some of the issues last year. The team again -- we continue trying to learn from everything that we do and the team has done a great job learning from our experiences, coming out of Q4 last year as we do every year and are excited to serve customers. In terms of the unit growth, there is not I can add in terms of split other than the overall -- other than the overall growth rate, but we are -- we are pleased with certainly we're seeing good customer growth, sellers are -- we're doing we think a great job for sellers. We continue to add a lot of unique selection throughout the year in terms of and we have customers. We see FBA four sellers getting further, further penetrated. We've launched some interest in products for our customers. We think our web services team is doing a great job. We realize that we have a lot of opportunities, but we need to be selective on which opportunities we pursue and I think beyond that, we're just overall excited and again ready for the holiday season. So anyway thanks everybody for calling in today. Phil Hardin : Thank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Ben Schachter - Macquarie Equity Research Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2014 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead. Phil Hardin : Hello and welcome to our Q4 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our Chief Financial Officer and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom Szkutak : Thanks, Phil. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 25% to $6.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of the earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases. Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million one year ago. I will turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Tom. Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18% excluding $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year. EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21% or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than two million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units, Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded one million. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%. Now let's talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared operating income of $510 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Now I will discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior-year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior-year. And now back to Tom with guidance. Tom Szkutak : Thanks, Brian. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion or growth of between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $450 million loss and $50 million in income, compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between zero and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter of 2014. I will conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services, beginning with first quarter of 2015. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. Thanks and with that, Phil, let's move to questions. Phil Hardin : Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question. Your line is live. Brian Pitz : Hello. Can you hear me? Hi, guys. Just a quick question. You had a strong holiday season. 100 million more items shipped for free this holiday, while FBA units was up 50% and fulfillment expense remain relatively flat. How did you manage that? Are the new sortation that was essentially the key to controlling shipping costs? And what percent of units sold are FBA? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Sure. In terms of the last part of your question, the percentage of FBA units of third-party paid physical units are over 40% and in terms of the fulfillment discussion, certainly Q4 is our most seasonal quarter. You can see that we get a little bit better leverage, I should say, than we have gotten in other quarters. Again, most seasonal quarter. Not a lot to add to that but we continue to ship on behalf of retail offerings as well as FBA that's included in that. Brian Pitz : Great. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Katie Huberty : Yes. Thanks. There's a headline on the tape referencing improving productivity in 2015. So I just wondered if you could clarify what areas of the business you are focused on in terms of productivity? And then what are some of the projects or areas that we should be prepared to see a large uptick in investment in 2015? Tom Szkutak : Yes. I think that you are referring to is, I mentioned on a earlier call, that we do an annual planning process. We actually start it in the late-summer, early fall. We go through that process. We take a break for the seasonal holidays and then we get back to it. We are in the process of finalizing it right now. And the teams are putting even more energy and attention on driving what we would call fixed expense and variable expense productivity as well as other efficiency projects. So there's many, many different pieces that go into that. But certainly we have added a lot of people and structure over the last several years. And so we have been putting folks on that. But we are just putting even more folks on it as we finalize our plans for 2015. Katie Huberty : And what areas should we expect big upticks in investment in 2015? Tom Szkutak : In terms of investment, certainly we are going to continue to support the growth of the business. You should expect that we will be spending more in terms of CapEx to support our web services business which is growing very fast. You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity, as we have done in prior years. We have updated you a bit as we have gone along and so we will do that from time-to-time during the year as well in 2015. So stay tuned on that. Katie Huberty : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed you are your question. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Real quickly on fulfillment cost. It looks like the overall cost is already quite a bit, around 17% growth in 4Q from 30% in 3Q. I am wondering if anything specific led to that improved overall growth from, is it maybe the key of a rollout? And then quickly, I think there was mentioning around breaking out AWS results. Wondering if any reason now? Perhaps it's getting to a level that you have to do it? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Yes. In terms of the fulfillment piece, it's not a lot of callouts on that. We had unit growth of 20% year-over-year. Certainly our FBA is growing at a faster rate. The sellers were up 65% over years who did 40% of our units. And again, the team continues to work on getting productivity there. In terms of AWS, we just think it's an appropriate way to look at our business for 2015. And so our plan is to separating it out as of Q1 of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Kaizad Gotla : Thanks. This is Kaizad Gotla, in for Doug. I think you noted Prime is growing faster internationally than it is in North America. So can you help us reconcile that with the difference between your North America and international EGM growth rates? Tom Szkutak : If you take a look, what I mentioned was, Prime, worldwide is up 53% year-over-year. so it's growing very fast globally. It's 50% growth in the U.S. and even higher in international. And so the reason both are contributing to the growth rates that you are seeing. But we are certainly at a earlier stage in international. So it's an opportunity for us, but in terms of the number of Prime members relative to the U.S. is smaller. So it's an earlier phase. So again, as we continue to grow that, it's an opportunity for us and certainly something that we are focused on. Operator : The next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions. Carlos Kirjner : Hi. I have two questions. Can you comment on your view of the relative value proposition of Prime in European markets and Japan? Is it similar to the U.S.? Two-day shipping and all the other benefits? Or is it different? Because we think, for example, that penetration of Prime in the European markets is much lower and you have told us that the number of Prime SKUs is much lower in the U.K., for example. So what's the fundamental cause of that? Why is it that Prime in the U.K. is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it timing or is it the proposition? The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position now and it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you are hiring aggressively, both in engineering and sales. Given the size of the opportunity and your position, what specifically prevents you from hiring faster, developing more products, investing more? How do you balance? What prevents you from doing that? Why wouldn't you invest twice or three times as much in AWS? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : In terms of, I will take the AWS one first, we are expanding very rapidly. We have been hiring a lot of great people over the past few years and several years. We do think it's a big opportunity. We are making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon and we are super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that certainly in our CapEx numbers and the assets we are acquiring with some of the capital leases you see that represented. So again we are investing very heavily, both in terms of people as well as capital for that business and we share your excitement about the business. In terms of from the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography and we continue to make it better in all the geographies that we have Prime. That's something that we are focused. The shipping speed is different by geography a bit, but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is, you mentioned is that, the proposition or the timing. So the proposition is a little bit different, but we will continue to work on making it better for all the geographies we have it in. But the timing is different. We did launch in the U.S. first. And then we launch in other geographies following that. So as a result, it's just earlier in these other geographies. So we still think it's a very good opportunity and something that we are focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup. Mark May : Thanks for taking my question. One on, I am sorry if I missed this, what's your thought or outlook for pricing in the AWS Cloud business for this year? It was obviously quite fierce last year. Do you think it will be quite as competitive in 2015? And then in the media business, we have been hearing data points about a slowdown in the eBook space. Are you seeing that? And what's your outlook? Do you see any hope for the media segment to improve as a result of that? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : In terms of the first question, we have continued to lower prices for customers in web services. Certainly that's something that we have been focused on. Since early launch, it's something we continue to focus on. It's hard to predict what will happen going forward. So I really can't comment on what we might or might not do there. But certainly it's something that we had, since launch, we have had many, many, it's in the high 40s, I think, in terms of pricing actions there. So we are very excited to make sure that we have great prices for customers. In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You are seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is, keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers. And last year it was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong. So for example, if you look at North American media growth rate in Q4 of this past year, you are seeing that impact. So that's what you are seeing there. Operator : Our next question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Great. Thanks. Hi, Tom. Can I ask you a high-level question? Tom Szkutak : Sure. Go for it, Mark. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Amazon has always pitched itself in terms of price, selection and convenience to customers. And I saw this great survey work that was done by Morgan Stanley in the last couple of weeks about this global survey that indicated a little bit of the shift in consumers' interest in online commerce more towards convenience. You must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for whether that broad value proposition to consumers is shifting. If it's shifting to be slightly less sensitive to price over the last couple of years and more towards convenience. Are you seeing that kind of shift? There's a lot of implications if that is, in fact, what is happening. Tom Szkutak : I would say it this way, in terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the fundamental inputs that we have talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more convenient. They are getting their physical product to them faster versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that. So that's certainly speed of delivery helps. We need to make sure and it's something that we are always focused on is making sure we have great prices and that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we are focused on. We do think that's important for customers. And we need to have the selection, be in stock. When a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. And so I don't view it as a shift. I view it as there is certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does. There is just amount of transparency. We think we like that world. And that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs so that we can be successful in that world and that's not something new. That's something we have been focusing on for a long time. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One, just if you can clarify any impact of the Fire phone in the quarter? And then secondly, can you talk about how fuel prices impact your model? And I know the shippers, they use a trailing index to calculate fuel, how those savings would show up? Or if you would pass those on to third parties, et cetera? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Yes. I don't have really any callout for the Fire phone. We continue to sell. I had mentioned, we have a little bit over $80 million of inventory at the end of the Q3 and it will continue to sell through that in Q4. In terms of fuel prices, not a lot to callout there in terms of impact on the quarter. Certainly, over a long period of time, if it's sustainable we should see some benefits there. Operator : Our next question comes from Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray. Gene Munster : Good afternoon. Over the past couple of years, it's just been a little bit of a roller coaster with margins for investors. There is points of optimism followed by points of frustration and there is really some optimism here in this report. Is there anything that you can help investors with to understand just how you think about different cycles of investing to try to smooth out some of this roller coaster mentality that happens with the stock? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Well, in terms of, I would describe it this way, Gene, we have a lot of opportunities in front of us that we have talked about and we are also being selective with those opportunities. We have added lot of resources over the past few years. We certainly have been in the heavy investment cycle. I mentioned earlier we are in the process of finalizing our plan for 2015. We always put energy into various productivity measures but we are putting, the team is putting even more focus on those efforts as we finalize our 2015 plans. We will have to see where that ends up, but we are putting more energy and focus around our various fixed productivity or expense productivity, efficiency projects and again a wide range of different activities. And so that's what we are doing and you will have to stay tuned to see how that progresses as we go. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler : Hi. Thanks, Tom. I have two questions. First on India, can you talk about the India opportunity broadly and maybe some advantages you may have versus some of the local peers in terms of leveraging your scale? That market appears to be just on fire right now. So just a little bit of color on India. And then on Prime, can you talk about the Prime member behavior in terms of purchasing frequency? How it looks today versus may be a Prime member that joined two years ago? I know it looks a lot different from those very early Prime adopters from six, seven years ago. But just more recently, over the last couple of years, is the behavior consistent as you grow the base? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Sure. In terms of India, we think it's very, very early. We are investing certainly in India and we think it's a very interesting opportunity. We have a very good team there and we are excited to participate. Again we think it is very early and so we like the opportunity there. In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step up their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we are seeing, another thing that we are seeing is certainly, as Jeff references and I quote, \"Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way.\" We see, for example, although it's still very early and we are learning and investing in this area, but I take video content, for example, what we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial, those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they are renewing at even higher rates than others. We see those people who were customers who were streaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't. And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint which we think is great. And so those are the things that we are seeing in Prime right now. And with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting. It's something that we are very focused on as we continue forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. On the topic of China, I wanted to know if you could help us either qualitatively or quantitatively understand what the trajectory or the size of the business is in China? And then maybe the trajectory around investments needed to compete in China? And how you think about the opportunity there long-term, looking through the lens of the competitive landscape and maybe Amazon's particular skill set on going to market in China? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Sure. We haven't broken out the size of the business. I can't help you much there, but we continue to work on the customer experience there. The team has some interesting ideas that you will have to stay tuned on, of how to make that experience better. And we continue to work on it. So there is not a lot more that I can add to that. Operator : Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. John Blackledge : Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. In North American media, aside from the video game impact, just wondering if there are any other factors driving the low or flattish growth year-over-year? And then, CapEx was up about 40% in 2014. It's kind of bounced around over the years. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of the level of growth in 2015? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Sure. In terms of the North American media, a number of different certainly puts and takes there, but certainly by far the biggest one is the one I called out, which is the video game console. So if you look at the growth rate in Q4 last year, meaning 2013 and Q4 2014, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly the video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So another way to say it is, the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year and obviously years ago we put the videogame consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games and they are larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that one when you look at the growth or when you compare Q4 2013 growth to Q4 2014 growth there. In terms of CapEx, we are not giving guidance on the 2015 spend, but given the high usage rates that we have had in web services, you should expect that we will be spending CapEx to support that growth and we will certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly a number of different types of CapEx that go into that financing, but the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business primarily on the AWS side. So again that's also included in that number. Operator : Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Tom, I was hoping you could give us some kind of sense of the impact on delivery times and conversion rates that you saw during this holiday season from the investments that you made in fulfillment, particularly the sortation centers that were added before the holidays? And then also, to what degree you have seen some leverage, or some of the slower growth in fulfillment costs from moving more of the fulfillment obligation to first party owned infrastructure? Tom Szkutak : Sure. In terms of the sort centers and I would say, just in addition to sort centers, what's happened over the course of last several years is, with all the fulfillment centers that we have added, we have actually invested gotten selection closer to customers. And so that's helped us from a delivery speed standpoint. It's helped us from a cost standpoint in terms of transportation cost being closer to customers. And so you it's a natural result of the footprint that we have added. In terms of sortation centers, there is a lot of different benefits of that. But certainly one of them is, as you get closer and closer, certainly throughout the year, it's helped us with holiday deliveries, it's helped us with Sunday deliveries and as we have closer to, in this case December to the end of holidays, it's certainly helped us from a delivery to the customer standpoint. So we are very pleased with the performance of those sortation centers. And really the global team of fulfillment team around the world, I think they did a terrific job during the holiday season as they did throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company. Mark Miller : Hi. Good afternoon. There's quite a disparate performance between North America and international in terms of the profit change year-on-year, up nearly $300 million, North America down over $100 million. So could you just help us understand why the international performance is so much weaker? Perhaps give us some color on the established markets in Europe relative to emerging markets. In the past, you have also discussed Japan. And then, is there an inflection point where international profits we could expect to head up again? Tom Szkutak : Sure. The first one is, certainly the growth rates are slower in international versus North America, certainly would have an impact. The second, as we continue to invest in international in terms of adding capacity for infrastructure, for fulfillment capacity, as you know, if you look at our international growth rates, the unit growth rates are actually growing at a higher rate than revenue. And then emerging geographies. We talked about India earlier. Very excited about India. We are investing in India. We are also investing in China. So those are certainly impacting the results as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins. They were up quite a bit year-over-year and it looks like, in our numbers, EGM beat and media missed. So any thoughts on the mix shift there helping or hurting gross margins? What are the key drivers for that line and can AWS continue to drive that in 2015? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Certainly, AWS mix of business is having an impact. AWS is certainly part of that and impacting that. Also just to keep in mind, our third-party unit growth is growing at a faster rate than retail and so certainly that's having an impact. And then obviously, continuing to lower prices for customers as well as working with our partners on the vendor side to support those activities from a pricing standpoint. So those are the dynamics. And in terms of 2015 beyond the guidance that we are giving, there is not a lot of callout there, but we have had a great success of being able to grow our retail offerings. Our marketplace side has grown very nicely over the years including 2014. The team has done a great job there. Fulfilled by Amazon, in terms of number of sellers, continue to grow there. The percentage of paid physical units are approximately 40%, a little over 40% of the total there. So that's become much more meaningful over the past several years. So very happy about that. So all those contribute to the numbers that you just talked about. Operator : Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Sebastian : Great. Good afternoon. One question as a follow-up on AWS and specifically some of the announcements related to WorkMail and WorkSpaces. This would signal that Amazon is moving up the stack towards a more of a SaaS offering. Is that the right interpretation? And if so, should we expect a broadening of those SaaS product initiatives? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : I am very happy to make a launch that you mentioned, we think it's exciting. It's certainly, you know we are excited overall about web services offerings. The team has done an incredible job in terms of innovation as well as operating these large services that scale. So they are doing a terrific job. In terms of what we might or might not do in the future, we are not talking about what that roadmap is. You will have to stay tuned. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equity Research. Ben Schachter : Tom, can you just give any color on how you are evaluating the opportunities to show video advertising against the ever-increasing video content? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : We really aren't using advertising too much in that area. You have seen it a little bit on some of our original content but beyond that we really can't comment. We think the experience we have is great for customers. We get a lot of positive feedback on the content that we have there and the uninterrupted content, if you will. And so I wouldn't speculate on what we might or might not do there. But we are getting great feedback from customers. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi & Hardt. James, your line is live. Please proceed with your question. James, if you have muted your line, please unmute it. Phil Hardin : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.",

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead. Phil Hardin : Hello and welcome to our Q1 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23rd, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. In addition, the release includes historical financial results of our North America, International, and Amazon Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash into capital and finance leases. Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares, compared with 476 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion or 22%, excluding $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was approximately 278 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12 month period, worldwide active customers were approximately $260 million, up from approximately $230 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units. Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue, compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. In addition we have provided historical results for these segments for 2014 and 2013 with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%. In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion or increased 2%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion or 21%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues. International segment operating loss was $76 million, compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating loss was $78 million. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income decreased 13%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $71 million. GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative $0.12 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q2, 2015 we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income, compared to $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions. Phil Hardin : Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed. Your line is live. Brian Pitz : Thank you. Can you share with us any updated metrics for Prime Now, how sticky is it in terms of repeat customers, average order value or other details? And also any update on your fulfillments center plans for the year, if you can disclose specific numbers, maybe you could just qualitatively tell us your focus either domestic versus international or sortation versus traditional FC build out? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Sure. On Prime Now, we don\u2019t have specific metrics we want to share today. But we have expanded to seven cities with more on the way. Customers are really enjoying the one hour and two delivery of tens of thousands of daily essential products. So the response has been great. We will point out that our operations network that was \u2013 has been building for the last 20 years helps make Prime Now a viable proposition for us and scale makes a possible. So really so far customer responses are great. Brian Olsavsky : And Brian on FCs, you know, as we've done prior years, it\u2019s early in the year and as we progress through the year we'll give you some updates on how many. But as a reminder we ended the year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and we'll update you as we go. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Ross Sandler : Great. Thanks for the new disclosure guys, really helpful. I guess, just speaking, you know, now a little bit we all understand the investments you are guys are making on international, retail, and maybe with our margins been declining. Can you give us a little color on what's driving up the North America retail segment margin and I guess in the context of that, just talk about the impact that Prime is having on the retail margin for both North America and International? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, sure. So North America operating margin up a 120 basis points year-over-year to 3.9%. Lot of good cost efficiency, but again we're continuing to invest so actively as we build the Prime platform and that we have customers. So you'll see lot of invention definitely to see the Prime platform, which things like Video Content, Prime Music, as we talk about Prime Now devices that will continue to build fulfillment centers for selection and expansion in FBA. So that\u2019s \u2013 its generally what's driving the operating margin in North America. Tom Szkutak : And just to add on to that, we're \u2013 we gave metrics last quarter about Prime. It\u2019s growing very fast. As Brian said, we're feeding the platform and certainly common thing with category expansion, new FCs, original content, Prime Instant Video devices, Prime Now. The common theme is they are all really intertwined with Prime and inextricably to our consumer business in Prime. So it\u2019s just we're happy to do it. And the last quarter we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 year. So we're super excited to have the platform and to continue to invest in it. Ross Sandler : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys talk a little bit more just about the international business and kind of the key initiatives here in terms of getting the growth to reaccelerate some of these levels? And then also perhaps little bit more on your strategy. In China how you are thinking about the cost structure there, relative to previous years and some of the key ways you might be able to rationalize things there? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, let me start with China. So, I think you'll see a lot invention, you're seeing a lot of invention from us in China right now. Amazon is trusted source of authentic [ph] international products and that\u2019s really what we're doubling down on now with a Amazon global store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access to over 1 million Amazon products globally. And then the team of flagship store for international brands which you've heard about giving thousands of direct imported products access to \u2013 customer\u2019s access to these products and those happen to be stocked and ready to ship from our fulfillment centers in China. So that\u2019s an added benefit. 25% of those are exclusive \u2013 over 25% of those exclusives to Amazon. So we continue to be selective in our investments there, but we're taking the long-term view and we have hopes for the new initiatives along the global \u2013 with the global store and the team of flagship store. Tom Szkutak : In terms of the growth for total international, just maybe some comments first about the current quarter and then I'll elaborate little bit further. But the growth was down 2% on a dollar basis, up 14% on local currency basis. So we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration versus last couple of quarters. And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that\u2019s something that we're doing globally. And so we're certainly \u2013 all those things we're working on globally. So those are things that at least in most geographies we have today. One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1st there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some \u2013we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year. So it\u2019s a headwind if you think about it for Q1. But we're looking \u2013 we think there is still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime is growing at a faster rate. We think there is still a great opportunity to add unique selection to \u2013 for category expansion. And again, so we're going to continue feed the Prime platform as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories. We're also very excited about India, if you take a look at our results for \u2013 from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative 76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange that\u2019s approximately breakeven, included in there we certainly have a sizeable step up in investment in India. And we're super excited from what we see there right now. We think its very big opportunity and we're investing appropriately for that big opportunity. So those are some of things that we're working on and we think there \u2013 we still have a lot of opportunity there moving forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the new inter US [ph] disclosure. Can you just help us on accounting question. The AWS data center costs related to the core e-commerce business, are those being allocated to North America and International, are those being fully embedded into the AWS segment? And then a second question goes back to China. I guess any early learnings from the team of [ph] partnership and whether you have any thoughts or potentially a lower capital intensive grow strategy in China? Tom Szkutak : To answer you first question, yes, they are, the associated infrastructure cost to run our North America and International consumer business those costs, those infrastructure costs are being allocated to those segments. The second question in terms of China, its early, we're liking \u2013 certainly some of things that we're seeing there, but there is not a lot I can add to that at this stage. Brian Nowak : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks. Maybe just another follow up on the new segment disclosures. Thanks for breaking it out. You know if we assume that the advertising segment is reasonably profitable than the implication is then that the core retail business is very modestly profitable close to breakeven. And just wondering what the thought process and strategy is behind that. If in a sense there is some subsidy to the retail side being used as you build market share in the core business? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consume segments. But the way you should think about it is, we are making some great investments for the long-term and that\u2019s really what's reflected in the operating results that you are seeing in terms of \u2013 so it is certainly impacting the operating margins both for North American and International. So it\u2019s the things that we \u2013 both Brian and I talked about that we're doing globally to support Prime platform all of those things that we mentioned, video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices. Those are all intertwined and certainly part of that. And then some of the things outside of that are more specifically related to International in addition to those are some of geographic stuff that we talked about. So I think you should think about it that way that certainly think its big opportunity and again, one of the reasons I want to give you an update, last quarter on Prime growth and you can see that that\u2019s going very well. And so we're feeding that and that\u2019s what we have been doing and that\u2019s what you see also and certainly results that you are seeing today. Colin Sebastian : Very helpful. Thanks very much. Tom Szkutak : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Mark May : Thanks for taking my questions. On the international revenue I believe there is probably \u2013 there's a real distinction here between some of your more established countries and some of your more emerging countries. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about for Germany and the UK and Japan and some of the more established markets, what the profit profile of those markets look like and just how much of the international segment results are being \u2013 losses being held back by a handful of the more emerging markets. And then a question on AWS pricing. It seemed like the pricing environment was pretty competitive last year. What are you seeing in the market this year and what are your expectations going forward? Are you expecting a bit more of a stable pricing environment? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Yes, in terms of International, we're not breaking out individual country results. The one thing that could mentioned around from a country perspective was India in terms of which \u2013 it certainly stepped up our investment. And if you look at it year-over-year, so that\u2019s certainly reflected in the numbers that you are seeing. In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it. But in terms of any comment on what to expect going forward there is not really much to add there. Brian Olsavsky : Its probably is worth adding that, although prices are factor, the primary factor for customers choosing with AWS is really around their ability to move quickly and to be nimble and agile. And so we're very pleased with the kind of continued adoption and usage growth we've seen and obviously the benefits of AWS around their ability \u2013 customers ability to be nimble as a primary factor there. Operator : Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. My first question is about the profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes ago that investments in Prime were part of the \u2013 most of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America. Which are much lower than the 5% to 6% EBIT margin that [indiscernible] retailer books? Despite a large benefit of booking repeat net. Here's the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the US, 30, 40, 50 million. Yet margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments that you are making will pay off? Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even the fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will be really fixed, are this still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS, I don\u2019t know 2 to 5 or 10 times its current size or do you expect the need to scale up at the same rate as revenues? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of the \u2013 our comments we made last quarter that we disclosed was, we disclosed the growth rate globally, as well as the growth rate in the US. And the growth rate in US after 10 years is up 50%, it was 50% year-over-year. And so 2014 versus 2013 in terms of Prime membership and that\u2019s after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99. And so, it gives you a feel for the work that we put into Prime to make that experience great for customers and the value that we are giving them. So again, given that growth. And so, that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s certainly one of the things that gives us comfort, but when we look at the individual pieces we like what we see, so in other words, some of the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give one example would be video content, both original and license content. We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers and what we've seen and to date is was certainly still an investment for us, its certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline if you will for video content. They convert it at a higher rate. We see \u2013 we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who scream actually, we retain those at a higher rate and we bring in new customers through our video pipeline. The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipeline. So in other words, they are buying very good from a physical product standpoint, as well as digital. So they are buying a diverse set of products. So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us customers who buy consumable from us, they will buy clothing from us, they will buy shoes from us, they will buy electronics, they will buy media items. So that\u2019s what we're seeing and so again it\u2019s some of these things are very early. We'll have to over time how efficient they are, but each period we go we keep the data that we see we're encouraged. And so that\u2019s just one example. But that\u2019s why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it\u2019s a great \u2013 the Prime platform if you will, and we think it\u2019s a great opportunity and again as I mentioned earlier all these things we're investing in are very intertwined. Brian Olsavsky : And Carlos, I think you had a question about AWS. From our perspective its business that\u2019s still really in day one. A lot of potential innovation in front of us we believe. And so you can see we're putting a lot of CapEx obviously there and including capital leases and we think over time we will be able to generate significant free cash flow with stronger ROICs. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Thanks. I want to go back on North America retail margins and just I want to try to figure out, I know you're not going to go, where they could go, but if we look in the past, I assume that if the base o2014 and in full year 2013 was probably depressed for North American retail margins, North American segment margins and if we look back five or six years, it's probable that that was running at kind of mid to high single digits CSOI margins. Kind of similar to the incremental margins you just reported for that segment 8.7%. So I guess the big question I want to ask is, is there a structural change in the North American retail business over the next \u2013 this year and the next couple years versus what you had call it in 2004 to 2009 when the margins were \u2013 I think were pretty clearly higher and now you're going to be recovering to those levels. That's what I'm trying to get at. Any color would be great? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Yes, the \u2013 thanks for the question Mark. Just in terms of going forward, we're not giving any specific guidance, beyond the current quarter. So I can't predict for you what could happen. But what you mentioned is, and some of the periods you were describing as you mentioned what our business look like, several years ago when we Prime was nascent and we were early \u2013 a bit earlier business. And so we go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very heavily. That being said, we \u2013 as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending time on making sure that we get productivity. So we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it. That\u2019s what's helping us with the improvement that Prime mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year, it\u2019s a number of different aspects, but certainly mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that. But again we think there is opportunities to improve margins over time, you'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But we certainly as you can see from not only results, but some of the data points that we've given over the last several quarters we are investing heavily in the business, again, because we like what we see and Prime growing so dramatically globally after being in it for long time and we think that that\u2019s a great platform to feed. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Hey, couple of questions on margins. First on AWS a think those are higher than most of us were thinking. Appreciate the disclosure. What is driving your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about passenger cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through your customers. And then secondly on international margins you know, clearly below history, below the US, what kind of things need to happen to get those at least to where the US is today much less back to where they were six or seven years ago? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Justin I'll take the AWS portion of the question first. So our model over the long-term really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be able to pass savings along to customers. And so we've had 48 price decreases since we launched. As I talked about earlier, that\u2019s one factor customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly. Brian Olsavsky : And in terms of international, again as you mentioned Justin, we are investing a lot right now which impacts the margins there again ex-exchange think of it as approximately breakeven for the quarter. And so again, we're continuing to invest. We're investing in all the things that we talked about related to the platform, continue invest in some emerging geographies, most notably certainly India with the step up given the experience we have. And so we are optimistic over time. We have a lot to do there, we think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. And so that\u2019s what we're doing, but we're excited about the opportunity and that\u2019s why you see the results that you're seeing there. Operator : Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the run rate of CapEx and capital lease obligations in the quarter as any sort of indication for full-year and the trajectory of investment in fulfillment and data centers. And then just on the question of a Prime and Prime Video, as we think about the way that media growth is trending now, is there a point where you start to think of allocating Prime, some of those Prime revenues to media to account for the \u2013 as Prime Video usage increases? Brian Olsavsky : Yes, in terms of the CapEx question, there is certainly two pieces of that, there is the consumer, the North American, International piece, is a number pieces, but certainly two largest pieces which certainly be the CapEx associated with fulfillment and the second would be infrastructure. And again it\u2019s for AWS versus North America, and International. I'll take the North America and International first. We're seeing good growth and year-over-year in terms of overall unit growth, in terms of revenue growth, certainly ex-exchange, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s early in the year. So we do every year we'll continue to monitor the growth there. We're making plans for the rest of the year and we'll get back to you as we progress throughout the year in terms of what fulfillment capacity will need to support that growth this year. In terms of web services, it\u2019s obviously growing extremely fast. We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective. Over the last few quarters here, usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there. In terms of the amounts, specific amounts, we're not giving guidance on that today and one of the reasons it is growing so fast that we wan to make sure we put the right amount of capital in place and the teams has done a great job doing all the planning and the execution around that, so that\u2019s what we're doing there. In terms of media, I am not fully sure I understood the question, but as it relates to I think its video, could you repeat the part of that\u2026 Heath Terry : Right. Was just getting a sense of as video becomes such a \u2013 becomes a bigger part of the Prime value proposition, do you start to allocate some of the annual revenues from Prime more directly into that media segment. Because of the level of usage associated with Prime Video versus the shipping benefits of Prime? Tom Szkutak : Heath, we do allocate some Prime to account for the video. Heath Terry : Okay. Great. Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Gene Munster : Good afternoon. Could you talk little bit about the focus on the same day and same hour and specifically about the incremental investments and just some context to how big of those investments are and separately is what the strategic advantages, there is something ultimately obviously to improve the experience. But do you see in any of your data that this opens you up to be more competitive with traditional retailers? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Yes, I'll take that one. We certainly as I said earlier, we see this as a natural extension of our existing infrastructure investments we've \u2013 the 109 fulfillment centers, again very close to customers. It allows us and locks for a same day and next-day deliveries. And to its extreme one hour and two hour deliveries as you've seen with Prime now. So we're not forecasting or giving much more on that, but we definitely see it as a valuable customer\u2019s proposition, customers and braced it. Again, smaller number of azans [ph] ten to thousands of azans are available for one, two hour delivery and generally in the category, essential products that you would need in short time period. Brian Olsavsky : And one thing I would add to that as Brian mentioned, earlier as well, we are in seven cities today and there would be more to come. We haven\u2019t said how many, but you should be definitely expecting more to come and we're excited to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Robert Peck : Yes, thank you. I was wondering Tom, could you give us an update on your retail store strategy. Should we expect stores to open up across the US or is that limited to China, New York. And that number two, India has come up a couple of times on the call today. China had several structural challenges based on the market there. I was curious if you could differentiate what you are seeing that's different in India versus the China challenges? Thank you. Tom Szkutak : Yes, in terms of our consumer business, we love the business that we have today. We love \u2013 we think there is a great opportunity to do that to continue to expand the existing business that we have. In terms of other things we have long standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do there. In terms of the second part India, and China could you repeat that part, I am sorry? Robert Peck : Sure. So you talked about India a couple of times today on the call. Obviously it's big area of investment focus for the company. China has some structural challenges based on how the marketplace is. I was wondering if you could differentiate what you are seeing in India that makes you optimistic there versus some of the challenges you faced in China? Tom Szkutak : Yes. Thank you for the question. They are very different, you'll see the growth rate in India is very rapid. We talked about last year and its increasing investment. I think the biggest differences there focused on sellers and the connection of sellers. A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed and grow their online businesses, you'll see from our press release that we've launched a new apps for that. So that helps them manage our inventory better and also respond to customer inquires. So that\u2019s probably the biggest difference that we see between India and China. But and still very, very early on in India. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. So can you talk about how the impact on available third-party SKUs impacts the business, particular in Europe and ultimately what you could do to drive more SKUs through the platform, whether it's lowering third-party rates or is it other factors to try to get more SKUs on their after a third-party?. Thanks. Tom Szkutak : We spent a tremendous amount of time on our seller business over the years and trying to improve both the experience for sellers, as well as customers. And we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers and that\u2019s why you see the results that we're seeing today 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, our third party units, that\u2019s up about 400 basis points from last year. Certainly one of the things that we've talked about its most, that\u2019s notable is fulfillment by Amazon. And so the benefit for sellers is they get to take advantage of our multi newer fulfillment network globally, we have a 109 fulfillment centers globally, as well as our customers get to take advantage of that as prime numbers where we offer in those geography. So it\u2019s really a great benefit for sellers, its good for sellers, its good for customers and we believe good for share owners too. So again, we're very excited, number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of the drivers along with all of the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is very helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company Mark Miller : Hi, good afternoon. Looking at the service sales less the AWS revenues you've got a $4 billion in fees mostly coming from the marketplace off a strong mid-30%. Help us think about the cost that go against those marketplace fees and specifically within fulfillment if you could help us understand how much of the cost is going against 3P are basically FBA fulfillment, perhaps percent of units part of the FC's that are going to 3P? Tom Szkutak : So Mark, I can't comment on the derive number, but I can say that FBA continues to grow really well, it\u2019s become a bigger and bigger part of our third party mix over the years. I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units. Obviously in the fulfillment line there is cost associated with that as well, as our other third party units as well I think like payment processing and other cost that we incur. So I don\u2019t know if there is much more we can say about that. Mark Miller : If I can insert a second question, given the upside and profitability in the first quarter, the guidance for the second quarter quite a bit lower. What are the factors you see that are negatives or I guess otherwise people can I think you are sandbagging? Thanks. Tom Szkutak : Let's take a look at the guidance that we gave, again, we gave as we have in previous quarters, we gave the wide range and from a consolidate segment operating standpoint we gave a 100 to 650, the implied margin at the lower end, the higher end is approximately 50 basis points upwards to 2.9%. This quarter in Q1 we were up 60 basis points year-over-year in total at the upper end of that forecast implied would be up 80 basis points, so again, that\u2019s the range and we think its appropriate range for Q2. Operator : Our final question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to margins a little bit more on AWS. As a look at the seasonality, I'm wondering if there's any seasonality in margins because it looks like margins 2Q and 3Q came in sub 10% versus mid teens in 4Q and 1Q and then sort of looking at it a different way, maybe given the different profitability into 2Q of last year, did that have any impact on the pricing cuts in April?. Thanks very much. Tom Szkutak : So, let's start with the increase you saw sequentially in margin from Q2 or Q3 to Q4 of 2014, so revenue grew by about 21.5% sequentially and expense grew by around 10% so obviously we were growing faster in top line and expenses. Over the long-term improvements and efficiency and innovation allow us to drive that kind of cost out of the business. I mean there is certainly was an impact with pricing changes and you probably saw some of that in Q2 as well, but over the long-term that\u2019s the model we follow. Ron Josey : Great. Thank you. Tom Szkutak : And with that, thank you joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Riley & Co. LLC Operator : Greetings, thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Hello. And welcome to our Q2 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Phil. I will begin comments on our second-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance releases. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital was 17% up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. Combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 488 million shares compared with 480 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign-exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had three orders in the preceding 12 month period worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue compared with 69.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International, and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate two segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%. In the International segment revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 72% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange. In the Amazon Web Services segment revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, CSOI increased 168%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP Operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion and inventory turns were 8.9 turns down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't include additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and if foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q3 2015 we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion, or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live. Mark May - Citi Investment Research : Thanks for taking my questions. You clearly had a lot of things working well in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS, which seems to be quickly emerging as kid of your largest contributor to operating income. Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business? If you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS? And in the press release you talked about expanding AWS into some new International markets. Can you give us a feel for how much of AWS' business today is domestic and what kind of opportunity you have there to expand AWS outside the U.S.? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, Mark. Thanks for your question. We will not be providing the granular customer detail unfortunately but we will say the growth of 81% was up 49% in Q1. You remember that we are lapping a number of large price decreases in Q2 of last year, so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS. We did announce a region in India. The other thing to mention is that we continue to see very strong usage of growth that's outpacing the revenue growth of 81% obviously. And so, we're really excited about it. From a distribution of customers, it is a global business. We have regions spread throughout the world; we have 11 regions at this point and have announced plans to launch a region in India in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed; your line is live. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you for taking the question. There has been some recent press reports talking about investments in India. I wanted to know \u2013 you've talked a little bit about that market in the past \u2013 whether there was any update there in terms of how you think about approaching the market and the level of investments that might be needed to compete in the market? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Certainly Eric. What I can say about India is when we see a positive surprise we double down on it. That's kind of our policy, and India is that kind of surprise. So we're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen in the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers. We are over $25 million or excuse me, 25 million names (14:02) which is the largest online store in India. And we continue to improve pricing and fast delivery so were super excited about India. I will not get into specific investment levels right now but we continue to ramp up our investment there. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. A couple of questions here. We followed this coming for a long time and profits seem to move around quite a bit year-over-year and year against year. And just wondering how you think about that? Is that just the nature of your big bets and that's just going to continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out? And then secondly, in AWS it does seem like pricing competition has come down and we've been to a lot of your events and it seems like you're emphasizing pricing a little less to your customers. Can you talk at all about the pricing environment in cloud? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, let me start with that second question. So, as Phil mentioned, we are seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year-over-year. We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis. Innovation is accelerating, not decelerating. We had over 350 significant new features and services and we believe that's what resonates with customers. While pricing is certainly a factor we don't believe it's always the primary factor; in fact what we hear from our customers is that the ability to move faster and more agiley is what they value. I'm sorry the first party your question was? Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: I was asking about just how the profitability kind of really moves pretty big swings year-over-year? Is that the nature of your just big bets and that can continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out going forward? How do you think about that? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes sure. Well here's how I think about it. We have two things, at least two things going on. We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS. If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think Jeff Bezos put it really well. He said we're going to look for things that are important to customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades. So we will continue to invest in the businesses we think fit that profile and we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile. So as far as lumpiness, admittedly it is lumpy and we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. I don't know if Tom's listening in. That's a great exit on his part. On International retail you guys had nice acceleration there. Could you give us a little more of the why behind that? Why would International revenue grow, particularly in EGM, accelerate pretty materially. And is that the impact \u2013 it's one thesis \u2013 is that the impact of kind of the buildup of Prime in International markets and also in the U.S. too, but more spend per Prime customers as they go through this evolution that is just kind of layering on? Is that what it is? What is causing that acceleration? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Certainly. We saw good acceleration in both North America and International this quarter. North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and International was up 800 basis points and half of that you remember we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last \u2013 April 1 of 2014. It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate last year particularly Q2. And so we are lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis points sequential gain. But independent of that, yes, you're right; Prime membership continues to grow. Faster outside, data that we gave at the end of the year. It's growing faster outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. and we are happy with both growth rates quite frankly. So I would say the Prime membership to Prime flywheel, the additional benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime flywheel. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the North America retail profitability was up nicely. Can you just talk to some of the drivers of that? Is it more top-line and more Prime subs coming on or is it more on the logistics side and what's driving the North America improving profitability? And then on the International profitability, is there any way you can help us understand the profitability of the more mature International markets like U.K. and Germany relative to the U.S. at this point? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So let me start with North America. 5.1% operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2. You hit a nail on the head. A lot of it is the top-line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis. So we are getting very good top-line growth. A lot of that is fueled by Prime adoption and we are dropping a lot of it to the bottom line with many of the efficiency projects. In International we have not split countries out. What I can say is that if you adjust for foreign exchange the operating margin is up slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. What you're seeing there is also obviously colored by our investment our increased investment in India based on the momentum and the success we've been seeing there so far. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask, First on Prime Day. Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early takeaways that you have and then also perhaps more importantly how you think that sets Amazon up for the back-to-school season and then also the holidays later in the year? And then also can you just comment on the head count, which I believe is up 18,000 or so sequentially, which I believe is the biggest number that you've ever added in a quarter. Is there anything in particular that stands out there, or just more fulfillment centers, more geography expansion as well? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Let me start with that second question first. Yes, head count was up 38% year-over-year. The vast majority of that is in operations where we are adding people for our new FCs and call centers. We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers and \u2013 but this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth. If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day. It surpassed all of our expectations. Any metric we look at, everything was a huge success. Customers save millions. New Prime members signed up in higher rates than we've ever seen. People bought more devices than on any other day. So, it's a great success. My hats off to operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was Christmas in July quite frankly, a bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said and orders increased 266% year-over-year. I'll also point out that worldwide FBA unit growth approached 300%, so not only was it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers which is great. So while not breaking out the impact of Prime Day specifically, it's incorporated into our guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I may be delusional, but if I add your capital leases and CapEx that suggests that AWS capital intensity is at least 80% if not much higher. What gives you confidence that if AWS continues to grow so fast and consuming so much capital two years out you'll be able to fund its growth from the retail business. And secondly, can you help me understand why you are not ruling out Prime Now and Fresh faster? What specifically are the bottlenecks there? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Let me start with that second one. Prime Now you said, and Amazon Fresh. We are working very quickly on Prime Now. We've now expanded to nine cities, three more in the quarter including our first International city in London. So, we're moving quick, but we'd always like to move quicker obviously. On AWS I think your question was more around the ability to fund AWS? No comment specifically on that. We do realize it's a capital-intensive business and we have modeling that shows it's going to be a very \u2013 it is a very good business for us and that's what we aim for as long-term return on invested capital and free cash flow. So, we're certainly cognizant of the capital part of the calculation, so not much more I can add on that, Carlos. Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, guys. I'm wondering if you can touch a little bit more on AWS margins. Is there a level particularly when you've been able to maintain pricing strength the way you have been, where you feel like margins start to become and that the leverage you have there start to become a catalyst for lowering prices? Or is that purely a competitive decision? And as you think about sort of AWS longer-term, is there a framework or structure that you use to think about where margins in that business should be? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Thanks for your question Heath. I will point out that we have continued to lower prices. We've had multiple price cuts this year. We are now up to 49 since launch in 2006, so it is a fundamental part of our business model. So is innovation. As I said, we have over 350 new features and services \u2013 also significant features and services that have launched this year. And as we were just talking with Carlos, the capital investment is very large as well, so we continue to fund it. And we are super excited with the customer reception that we are getting and the feedback we get from large customers so we are thrilled with the business. And price reductions are part of that model. And again, as I said earlier, we're in the long haul. We're in this for the long haul. We are looking for return on invested capital, free cash flow, and happy customers in the space. Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. I really appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. I guess, another question on AWS if I may. So, I want to go back to something that you said, Brian. You said that you've seen greater efficiency in the business from a cost standpoint. I was wondering if you can maybe parse that out a little more for us. Were you referring to OpEx or CapEx? And if you're referring to CapEx as well, do you feel you that you have reached escape velocity that should allow CapEx as a percentage of revenues, pricing aside, to now allow you for a constant decline in that metric, CapEx as a percentage of revenue for that that particular business? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : What I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side, the cost to generate the capacity for AWS. I will also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS so we see it in the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue. It's an inter-company relationship. So, we get a double whammy there. We are getting great efficiency from our external AWS business but also from our own use of AWS services. Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ron V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on Heath's question, just on the price reductions. Brian, you said earlier in the year, can you just compare the reductions earlier this year versus the ones across the board and from last year in 2Q 2014? And then a follow up just on the third-party units I think you mentioned third-party units are now 45% or maybe 47% of total units. Is there a natural limit there or it doesn't matter as long as the customer experience through FBA is seamless? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hey Ron. So, I'll comment on the units first. We are really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first-party or third-party and I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a tailwind for third-party business in general. When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we are really happy with what that's doing for third-party business. We're working really hard to give customers as many options as possible and allowing them to choose. And we don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice. On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. We've also lowered prices for customers 49 times since launch and so it can be lumpy, but over the long haul that's the model we follow. Ron V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Vogel with Barclays Capital. Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. Just a question on the content side, is there any update on how engaged folks use the video side of Prime and their shopping behavior, number one. And number two, just any update on sort of your plans for growth on the content cost side? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. On the engagement of the Prime customers, excuse me PIV customers, we have seen buying habits that look like normal Prime customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes in through the digital pipelines, but we do also see a higher pickup in retention rates and free trial conversions. So we're very happy with the linkage between our digital offerings in the Prime customer base. On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential guidance Q2 to Q3 being lower, is two things. What we are talking about is the fulfillment center \u2013 additional fulfillment center costs that we see this time every year as we get ready for Q4 but also additional step-up in content spend, where we spend a lot of our content in Q3. You will see extensions of a lot of the successful shows that we've had so far this year. A new pilot season including Man in the High Castle and Hand of God so stay tuned for that \u2013 or seasons of Man in the High Castle and Hand of God. Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Eugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good afternoon, and congratulations. I just want to follow up on a previous question. In past calls you talked about an increased focus on productivity. Is that still a focus of yours? And separately, any thoughts in terms of how robotics are impacting \u2013 any updates in terms of number of robots in fulfillment centers? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure thing. Thanks for your questions, Gene. On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business. We had very high expectations for Amazon Robotics and its impact on our warehouse cost structure and we have been very pleasantly surprised by the job being done on that by that team. So that's looking great. Efficiency, yes. As we've talked about in the last few calls we have even more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity. I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say what does that look like? We have defect reduction and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our cost but also to improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience. We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into the decisions. As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well. We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and the throughput of the fulfillment centers, and just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses in the sort centers that we added primarily last year. All have helped our cost structure, so just a little more color on maybe some specifics on the efficiency area. Eugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. Now halfway through 2015, any update or insights on your fulfillment center build-out plans for the year? If you can't disclose that, can you maybe just give us a general sense of focus and strategy? How should would be thinking about domestic versus International? As well as sortation versus traditional? What's kind of the path to build that over the next 6, 12, 18 months? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So we ended the year last year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and 19 U.S. sort centers. And typically we're looking at what the demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need; so still a little early in the year to comment on that, but in the past we've given an update sometime around Q3 on that. But continuing to build as we have demand. And like Brian said, we like to be close to customers and benefit from having inventory close to customers as well. So like I said, a little early for the update at this point but something we're looking at and something the team's working really hard on. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks and congrats on the great quarter. In the Retail business obviously a lot of variables driving growth there, we're seeing higher Prime membership levels for one, but I wonder how much of that growth you can also break down by some other factors; for example, we're seeing a notable increase in selection across longer tail categories? And then secondly, in the press release, no mention of Fire Phone. I think almost every other product was mentioned. Can we just chalk that one up now to a learning experience and an example of where Amazon is showing some discipline around investments? Or how should we think about that? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So I'll start with the Fire Phone question. We have a policy of not commenting on our roadmap, so can't give you anything there. We obviously do learn from everything we do and value the feedback we get from customers, but nothing to share at this point. In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth. Prime is obviously very important as well; we really haven't teased those apart. FBA becomes very important as well and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there, and sort of the linkage between marketplace and Prime that FBA provides. So all those things are going on. As you're seeing EGM strength across a lot of the categories there, there was no single category we're really calling out, but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime growth as well. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. So, Brian, I know you guys don't like to provide guidance beyond the next quarter but philosophically if we go back a few quarters you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years should start to benefit and pay off. And we're see \u2013 we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North America retail and it looks like you're still investing heavily on International retail. So if we kind of look out 2016, 2017, is there any high-level philosophical commentary about whether you see next year as another year of these types of trends that you're seeing now? Or are there any bigger investment areas particularly in the retail business that you might be looking to take advantage of? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks for your question. I can't forecast into the future on that but I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now which again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. That includes video content including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now. We have robust device business including the launch of a new Paperwhite Fire TV Echo with general availability and numerous other products that we're very excited about. That roadmap, we know that those devices drive customer engagement and sales. We build fulfillment centers so that we can add selection and we can add FBA partners. And we had things like same-day delivery which we talked about. On the AWS side we continue to invest in that infrastructure. We talked about opening, announcing the region in India so there's expansion there as well. Future expansion, services expansion Internationally very similar to the U.S. on a number of the Prime fronts but also the investment in India. And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today, the launch of Mexico which we are excited about and Amazon business. So lots of \u2013 as I said, lots of investment in front of us. But we operate in two paths. We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the business that we're in. We're investing wisely in things that we think are big and important. And it's not a static activity. We continue to evaluate those investments, take into account what customer response is and make changes. So I think you can look forward to the continuation of that into the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company. Kerry Rice - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. You've talked a lot about operational efficiencies. I know you guys have partnered with the post office and deliveries. Can you talk a little bit about how that is potentially benefiting and maybe the longer-term strategy with the post office? And then, you guys haven't necessarily broken this out, but I think you do generate a fair amount of revenue from advertising. I think that's in the other category. Is there anything that you can provide on advertising revenue? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So I'll start with the first part of that question. We definitely are delivering a lot of packages with the post office. I think most notably they did a lot of the Sunday delivery that you saw when we started launching Sunday delivery. So we try lots of things for fulfillment. We're constantly working to provide the best experience to customers and be as efficient as possible. And so we're happy with all the partners we have and continue to work with them to provide the best experience possible. For advertising, I would remind you that certain parts of the advertising roll up into other. Some actually roll up to EGM and media, as well. So it's a business we're really excited about. We're taking a customer centric approach as we build that to make sure we're providing engaging business, engaging adds to customers and making sure we keep the customer front of mind. And it's a business that the team is excited about and working hard on. Kerry Rice - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Thanks. Brian, just to follow-up on the India question earlier. I mean, o my knowledge foreign e-commerce operators such as yourself are not allowed to have first-party retail operations. But given that fulfillment enhance customer service has always been a high focus item for you guys. What steps have you taken in the country to make sure that the consumer experience there is as good if not better for the inventory on which you have no direct control? And secondarily, similar to China, you have a pretty large population base and Internet penetration growing that's probably comparable to what was the case when you add JOYO \u2013 when you acquired JOYO. So can you provide any color on how the general operating environments are the same or different? And do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to what you saw in China? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, your first question was about the infrastructure and how we're managing the customer experience in India. So FBA, Easy Ship and some of those programs are important to us. They're very valuable for sellers to make it easy for the seller to get their goods to the customer. They're great from a customer experience standpoint because we can do what we do best with the logistics. And so there is a lot of investment and a lot of efforts going on that front. I would say that India and China are totally different. And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far. And so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at that point. Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. It appears that Amazon is growing its share of household budget driven by many factors, Prime growth and strong growth in large verticals like apparel among others. Specifically on apparel, I'm just wondering how you view the breadth of Amazon's apparel offering. Any color on that segment's performance in the second quarter. And how do you view Amazon's apparel opportunity going forward? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Thanks for your question. We have not broken out specifically apparel, but we're super excited about that business. It's growing very well. We like our position in it. We think our website is very tuned to selling online. So we're very happy with that. It is a big business for us, not only in North America but also Internationally. You mentioned a couple other consumables categories. I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard lines categories, as well. We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others. So, very happy with the EGM business as a whole. John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : And your final question comes from Scott Tilghman with B. Riley. Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks. I wanted to just follow up on a couple things. Three quick questions, first off on International I was wondering if you could compare and contrast relative performance of media and EGM? You're moving in different directions. Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping but most notable is that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at the beginning of the year and it seems like you're costs are coming down. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And then third, just following up on Brian's question around the FCs. I was wondering how many of the facilities lend themselves to expansion rather than having to put up a new facility? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Let me start with the first question on International media and EGM. I think we are seeing similar trends in both geographies, those segments that EGM growth is very strong media growth has been consistent for the last four quarters. We do like the work being done by media teams. There's a lot of pipeline of invention : things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music; all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will. They work great with our devices by the way. They drive other non-media sales. They are very tied together, although certainly the EGM is outpacing the media segment or media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again, the combination of doing our own shipping and using third-party carriers so the rate increases are staged and we see those quite frequently, so nothing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we are looking to always get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have and as we need new facilities we place them closer and closer to customers so that can have its benefits as well, but not much more to add on that one. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations web site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.",

LLC Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Hello and welcome to our Q3 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 22, 2015 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less lease principal repayments was $3.1 billion, up from an outflow of $99 million. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases was $637 million, up from an outflow of $2.3 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.4 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 489 million shares compared with 481 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 294 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide seller units represented 46% of paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior-year period. Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of revenue, compared with 71.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $7.6 billion, or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 12.4%. Tech and content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue, compared with 10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 4.7%. Now, I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion, or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion, or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM now represents 79% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% operating margin, compared to a loss of $60 million in the prior-year period. North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. In the International segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 24%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 billion, or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 71% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior-year period. International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% operating margin, compared to $98 million in the prior-year period. AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million, compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $437 million or a loss of $0.95 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 billion year-over-year to $14.4 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $9 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 79 from 74 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as a global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we've described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effects on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 billion, or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $620 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter 2014. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question? Operator : Certainly. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed. Your line is live. Scott W. Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question, Brian, International retail growth continues to improve, and I was wondering if you can just talk through some of the dynamics there, understanding that consumption tax in Japan comped, you have some newer markets where you have physical infrastructure now in Europe, and then also the dynamics in India and China as contributors. And then secondly, maybe if you could just, given how profitable AWS has become, if you could give a framework for thinking about the long-term profitability of that business. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Scott. Thanks for your questions. On the International, yes, you're right. First of all, the FX neutral growth of 24% year-over-year was up 200 basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last year, which we said last year impacted Q2 and Q3 and not really impacted Q4. So we're seeing the last of that on the comp. And the impact of Prime Day globally we estimated at about 200 basis points, and we saw a pickup in both. I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that is International as well, and it was a great event for \u2013 a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike. But the base International growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, greater selection, greater Prime selection, including FBA. So it's essentially the same playbook at the U.S., the additional Prime features. We launched a Prime Now location in the UK this quarter. Not materially going to impact the entire continent, but it's a good start. So we like the trends in International, and they mirror many of the same things we see in North America. On AWS, I don't remember your question, business model there. Yeah, let me talk about margin. It was up sequentially from Q2, from 21.4% to 25%. We're continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've launched 530 new significant features this year, which is more than last year already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices eight times since a rather large price cut in April of 2014, excuse me, April of 2014. And we like that the customers are really responding. They like the speed and agility that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many of which are also enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure. Amazon Aurora, one-tenth the price of other high-end commercial databases, a new storage class of Amazon S3, QuickSight, also very effective and cost-effective products for our customers. So like AWS, the model remains early days and we enjoy leading this business and customers responded well and we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others. But the growth rates and margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward. But we're very encouraged by the business, and so are our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hello? Can you hear me? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. A question hopefully hasn't been asked already is around AWS. Margins were obviously quite strong in the quarter. Can you speak to the sustainability of the margin improvement that we've seen there, and what is your long-term expectations for profit margins for this business? And if you could give us a sense of what CapEx for this segment of the business looked like in the quarter, and the rate of growth there would be helpful. And then secondly, your employee adds were fairly strong in the quarter as well. I wonder if you could call out any particular areas of \u2013 within the business where you're strengthening your hiring efforts. Thanks. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : So this is Phil. I'll take the AWS portion. So I'll echo what Brian said earlier. This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy. We're taking a very long-term view on this business. We're excited about the potential there, and really the team's focused on just keeping their heads down and continuing to accelerate the pace of innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer. So a lot of hard work going on there. But again, we're taking a long-term view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as possible in that space. On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth. And so, on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have. And some of the expense for things like data centers or new regions can be a little lumpy, and we've mentioned a couple of new regions we're working on throughout the world. So that's going on as well. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Mark, on your head count question, you're right. Headcount was up 49% year-over-year, which is higher than Q2 \u2013 we saw in Q2. This is going to be primarily in our ops area. If you exclude ops-related employees, our head count's growing actually slower than our FX neutral growth rate of 30%. So, what's going on in ops is we've added 14 net fulfillment centers this year, bringing the total to 123 globally. We've added four sort centers in the U.S., bringing U.S. footprint to 23. We're staffing earlier in those locations, we're in good shape for the holidays and ready to go. The other issue is there, the other reason is that we are also doing a lot of conversion of temp workers to full-time workers purposefully. There is a metric employment of full-time hires. So it is a little bit higher due to that program. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I'm tempted to ask about the long-term margins for AWS, but I won't. Could you talk about two areas? One, EGM growth in North America. It's accelerated really strongly. Any color behind what's \u2013 any particular categories that are driving that? And secondly, you've made some public comments in the last eight months about some, on the retail side, about investments internationally, particularly in India. Could you just refresh us on what kind of levels of spend you're interested in targeting in that market, and then maybe as part of that, any comments on China and how well you think you're doing there now. Thanks a lot. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line. So, we're very encouraged with EGM growth. And on India, I will not \u2013 excuse me \u2013 I won't give specific dollar numbers around investment, but I can give you an update on India. We're really encouraged with what we are seeing, both on the customer side and the seller side. On the customer side \u2013 excuse me, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year. We are in the middle of the Diwali season that is going really well. Sales are 4x what they were last year. So customers are responding greatly this year. We continue to invest. We've been adding products at a rate of 40,000 products per day so far this year. And just as big as the number of sellers, the sellers, the number of sellers has grown more than 250% year-over-year, 90% of those sellers are using our logistics and warehouse services. And as a result, we've tripled our fulfillment capacity year-over-year. So we are very encouraged, as I said last quarter in India, and continue to invest there very heavily. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Mark, I think you asked about China as well, this is Phil. So we're continuing to work on some of the items we've been talking about for a couple of quarters now. So the team had some interesting ideas, really focused on making Amazon a trusted conduit for Chinese customers to access, authentic international branded products, and things that customers can't get. I think Amazon Global Store continues to expand the selection there. We added about another 400,000 items to that store this quarter and continue to focus on using our global network of vendors to be able to get those products to customers. We continue to test store on Tmall as well. The team has some other ideas, but that's what we're talking about so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Can you call out in terms of the 3P business what you're seeing in terms of third party sellers maybe needing to make more and more of their goods Prime eligible? What the economics of that might be in terms of creating a tailwind for the business, and how we should think about that evolving over the next couple of years. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Eric. What I can tell you is the 3P percent of revenue continues to grow, we are now up to 46% of paid units, which is up 400 basis points year-over-year, and 100 basis points sequentially of Q2. We feel that Prime and FBA are \u2013 reinforce each other. They're inextricably linked. FBA as Prime selection and Prime growth attracts more FBA sellers. So, we have seen growth in FBA, it increases our Prime fast track eligible selection which we like and customers like. So, we like what we see on the third party side. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. We did see the acceleration in EGM. Just wondering if some of the local delivery and Prime Now is driving that acceleration. Is that having a big impact on your business? And down the road, do you think the delivery infrastructure will be valuable in maybe delivering third party and other units? Thank you. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. So it's still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery options. We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast. I think we launched a couple more Prime Now cities just today, so that brings us up to about 17 across the globe. On the next day or same day, here in the U.S., we continue to expand that as well, but we think that those fast options add us to the consideration set of a customer's purchase on some purchases that we might not otherwise be included in. But at this point, we're still working on that and kind of getting it up to speed. So nothing specific to call out on that. On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network around the world, but I can't respond to any of the rumors and speculation. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust. Kunal Madhukar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. This is Kunal for Bob. Quick question on India. Is there any change or any indication that there might be a change in the regulatory framework that would allow you to go direct? Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. I don't know that we have anything to comment on on that. Kunal Madhukar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask the most frequent investor question and concern that we get is when will Amazon flip back to its heavier spending and investment ways from 2014 and earlier? So I just wanted to ask, is that a legitimate question do you think or are you now at a point of scale and market share and maturity that you can sustainably manage the heavy investment while still delivering material profit? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, thanks, Doug. Well, I will point out that this quarter showed a lot of innovation, a lot of new products and features and a lot of investment. We've already talked about India but domestically we are, globally, we are investing very heavily in our Prime platform, both in North America and International and that includes video content and original content, Prime Music. Phil just said the Prime Now has been expanded to 14 metro areas. We've had same-day delivery now in 16 metro areas. We've built 14 new fulfillment centers. We've launched multiple devices including e-readers, tablets that are priced under $50, Echo, Dash Button. So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime. And on the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but could be lumpy over time. The other dynamic in our company though is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. And I think you see a lot of that in this quarter's P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in infrastructure. So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well. So I would say it's not as much of pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. It's more of a constant. The investment will, it sometimes ebbs and flows, but the cost reductions will be a constant presence and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the customer experience better. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have had the Kindle Store in Brazil since December of 2012. Just curious about the learnings around that and kind of what benchmarks are you analyzing as you kind of try to determine whether or not to invest further in a larger Brazil store? And then the second one, just curious for comments on International Prime sub growth. It sounds like Prime subs are growing really well. I think a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned how they're growing over 50%. Is that still the case? And if so, what's driving that faster International Prime sub-growth? Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : So, on the Brazil side \u2013 this is Phil \u2013 we've had the Kindle Store in Brazil for a while. I think we look at all of our investments with an eye towards trying to maximize long-term free cash flow at strong returns on invested capital. So that's across the board. That's kind of the criteria we're using, making sure we're building things that customers love that can have attractive financial returns over time, and can persist for a long time. And if they work, can be big. And so, that's the metrics we're using. There's nothing specific to call out to Brazil though. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And this is Brian. We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year at the end of last year, which last year in a year when we raised prices early in 2014. The global growth rate was 53% and North America growth rate was 50%. So, by default, the International growth rate was higher. We like the adoption of Prime internationally. It's helped by additional selection that's available for fast track shipment, including FBA. So that flywheel is working. We've also launched video benefits most recently in Japan, but we have them in the U.K. and Germany. We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. We launch Prime Now in the U.K. So, it's very similar to the U.S. story, potentially time lagged a bit, but we are seeing the same customer adoption and impact on growth rates. Operator : Our next call, caller, it's from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed. Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have two questions. So you have told us that you have tens of millions of Prime users that you are investing heavily in Prime. Now, at this scale I know with the 50% plus growth rates that you just mentioned, if you roll the clock two or three years, one can see Prime penetration in markets like the U.S. starting to saturate as there are just so many homes in the country. How should we think about the level of investment in Prime once you have reached full penetration? Are there components that are due primarily to customer acquisition, and what's the right way to think about that? And secondly, what are the economic drivers that justify the business case for Prime Now? I don't expect you to give us any numbers, I've learned that in the last few years. But what are the components of the customer lifecycle value calculation or whatever calculation that you make to justify someone dropping a box with a, I don't know, $15 order to a customer? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Thank you, Carlos. First on, classify as Prime demographics. So yes, we still think there's a lot of people in the country who are not Prime members. And we're anxious to have them try it and sign up and join. The other thing that we see is that with our vast offering of selection and faster and faster shipping programs, we have more competitive offering for many things that they buy. So there's a share of wallet element to it as well over time that we are looking to be more useful to customers all the time. On your comment about the economic drivers of Prime Now, what I'll say is customers really value it. It's not our entire selection, it's tens of thousands of items that they may need on a daily basis. We think it's an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime and it's, in many ways, something that we can do that others can't, because it's a natural evolution of our 20-year effort to grow our fulfillment center network and our scale quite frankly makes it possible to even offer this to customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Doshi with Mizuho Securities. Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about India and what's kind of the opportunity there that you see, there's a tremendous amount of \u2013 tremendous middle class there. But the distribution can be very challenging. So is that an area where we could see Amazon really building out the last mile? And then there's been some reports of an Amazon potentially trying to close the gap in terms of delivery and deliver sooner. On the grocery side, what's the impetus there? And can we see how the recent markets have been trending on the grocery side that you've launched recently? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'll take the India question. So again, India is a different market and does not have a lot of the same ready fulfillment options that some other countries did. We see that as an opportunity, an opportunity that we can build and we can bring to sellers. And as I believe I already mentioned, we like what we see. We're very encouraged. Customer accounts, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year and sellers \u2013 number of sellers is up 250% year-over-year. 90% of those sellers use our logistics and warehouse services, as you mentioned, which has caused us to triple our fulfillment capacity. And we're happy to do so. We like what we see in India. We think we have \u2013 we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. So, on the grocery side, for fresh we're in a handful of metropolitan areas here in the U.S. It's been a relatively measured rollout by Amazon standards. We continue to work on the customer experience and making sure we're really delivering a quality experience for shoppers. And we're also working on the economics. And so we continue to work on that, but not much new to add right now. Operator : Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Patrick Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense how some of the recent announcements from FedEx and UPS about pricing during the holidays and the structure of some of the third party relationships might impact you? And given the investments that you've made in your own fulfillment infrastructure, how much of a competitive advantage you feel like you've got during the holiday season as other retailers that are more directly exposed to these changes have to deal with it. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No comment on the pricing. I would say that we have 23 sort centers, which allows us to control a lot more of our shipments for longer. But we certainly value our relationships with USPS, FedEx, UPS and other global carriers. So \u2013 and we're looking forward to a great holiday season. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Hi, guys. Just quickly on, if you can talk about some of the more experimental projects you work on. I guess the travel business you're kind of in again for a few months and got out of, also maybe just with restaurants, providing restaurant delivery. How do you view these services? They're not necessarily core to what you do. Obviously, you can provide those services, but how should we think about these types of investments longer term? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So on destinations, we're constantly trying new things and testing and measuring and iterating here at Amazon. We learned a lot, but we've discontinued that. On the restaurant delivery, we've had it for a couple months here in Seattle and recently announced it in Portland. It fits very well with Prime Now. So at this point, it's pretty small, but something we're excited to do for customers. We think it will be helpful for them, and we're happy to take advantage of some of the competencies we've built with Prime Now and with our fulfillment network so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Some questions on video. Any color such as engagement on the recent launch of video products in Japan, including the Fire TV, the Fire TV Stick, and Prime Video? And also, any general updates on your video content strategy or view on standalone streaming separate from Prime. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I'll take that one. This is Brian. So no specific callouts in Japan. I would say that we are still very bullish on our Prime Instant Video, especially our new original content we've created. We think it's being critically acclaimed and also a big hit with customers. Man in the High Castle is coming out shortly, as is the second season of Transparent which won Emmys this year. So we're really excited about the creative team we've assembled and the products that they've been able to bring to Prime customers. And we still like the customer reaction. Free trial conversion rates are higher when Prime members stream, and they also renew at a higher rate their annual subscriptions. So, again, that's very important to us as well and we're very happy with the results. Operator : Our next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research. Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys. So Prime has done remarkably well with folks willing to pay $99 up front. But do you expect to have different offerings for different cohorts? In other words, right now, Prime is sort of a one-size-fits-all model. Could we see different pricing models for different demographics in the future? And then separately, can you also talk about how shipping leverage changes during the holiday season when shoppers tend to order more items per transaction? Thanks. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Sure. So this is Phil. On the Prime pricing, we do have a few different programs for different demographics today with programs like Prime Student or Prime Family, which we're very excited about. Can't speculate as to what we'd do in the future, but Prime is a program that's really important for us, and we're working hard every day to continue to build selection there and to continue to make Prime better. And so hopefully, you see that in the list of things we've launched recently and the continued cadence of making the services we have better. We just added a lot of new music in our Prime Music program. And as Brian mentioned, some of the upcoming programming should be pretty good in the fall. The Man in the High Castle was actually our most-watched pilot, so we're excited about that one as well. So continuing to work on Prime. On the shipping side, I would say it's a difficult equation. Yes, order size can go up, but we ship a lot of toys and bigger items. So it's hard to predict what that looks like. But having the density, having the sort centers has certainly helped our cost structure in that area and having inventory closer to our customers. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks. So Brian, it seems like you guys are rolling out Prime Now as well as product verticals internationally fairly quickly, especially if you measure it versus the pace of rollout for Fresh or your other international older territories. So am I reading too much into this, or have guys put in place different processes to iterate more quickly? And second, I think you've disclosed that as of the end of 2014, a little less than 10% of your fulfillment centers are outfitted with Kiva. So I guess are all of your other fulfillment centers on a go-forward basis going to have Kiva? If not, why not? And given the pickup and presumably the volume throughput there, does this mean you can slow down the pacing of your build-out there? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, sure. On Prime Now, it is our intent to roll out benefits and functionality globally as quickly as possible. I think we're able to do that with Prime Now and get to the UK faster. We're happy with that. It's not necessarily common on AmazonFresh. They're just, they're different businesses. So we're happy with the launch in the UK and the team did a great job to get that launch in a timely manner. On Kiva, we are up to 30,000 bots at the end of Q3, and they're in 13 fulfillment centers. At the end of 2014, we had 15,000 bots, so we've doubled that amount and they were in 10 warehouses. So our intent is to use that more widely and stay tuned. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly on paid unit growth, accelerated 26% this year. I realize it's easier comps, but anything significantly higher or anything that happened this quarter? I know Prime Day could be it, but wondering if that was the reason. And then on AWS usage, just wondering if you can give an update on usage. I believe last quarter you mentioned usage was growing faster than revenue. I wonder if that's the same case this quarter. Thank you. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : So this is Phil. On the unit side, you did see units move at a rate that's highly correlated with revenue there. Keep in mind, AWS and some of the other rental-type offerings don't generate units, so we don't count those. But we did see, certainly saw some additional units as a result of Prime Day. And on a longer-term bigger basis, the continued growth of Prime, the continued selection expansion, is helping with the unit's growth there. Sorry, was there a second part of your question? Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC : It was just on AWS unit growth. I think last quarter, you said it was growing faster than revenue. I'm wondering if that's still the case here. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : We continue to see really, yeah, sorry. We continue to see really strong usage growth across the board, and it's coming from customers of all sizes. We also have recently announced that Aurora, which is our new database software, is our fastest-growing service ever. So for a long time, we talked about Redshift, and Aurora has now outpaced that. So we're very excited about what we're seeing there. Operator : Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, with the courts striking down the Safe Harbor provision between the U.S. and the EU, how do you see the changes to European data storage requirement affecting AWS potentially? And on the Kiva, a question asked earlier, can you just maybe help us understand the capital intensity of an FC using Kiva versus one that's not? Thank you. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : So, this is Phil. I'll take the Safe Harbor question with AWS. With our EU-approved AWS data protection agreement and model clauses we have in place, AWS customers can keep running their global operations using AWS and be in compliance with the e-law. I think your second question was about the capital intensity of Kiva. Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yeah, Kiva, yeah right. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Yeah, I'm going to be vague on the scale of it, but their capital intensity is offset by their density and throughput. So it's a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements to your cost structure, but we're very happy with Kiva. We think it's a great, pairing our associates with Kiva robots to do some of the hauling of products within the warehouse has been a great innovation for us. We think it makes the warehouse jobs better and I think it makes our warehouses more productive. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, great. Thanks. Two questions. So first, our data suggest that a U.S. Prime sub growth is growing very rapidly at scale. Just wondering where you think the U.S. Prime sub base is right now on the adoption curve. And then the second question is North America and EGM growth accelerating again this quarter. We're assuming growth is being driven in part by categories like apparel and consumables versus perhaps some more mature category like electronics. So the questions are, with a vertical mix changing, how should we think about the impact of margins or some of the newer and faster growing categories, structurally higher margins for Amazon than the more mature categories? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I would say \u2013 can't get into too much detail on the components of EGM profitability. I would say that we're seeing strong growth across all of our EGM categories. And we have great teams that are chasing a lot of different product lines and working with vendors to get more selection on site, both retail and also third party. So still a lot of room there. On the Prime sub growth, we're not updating the statistics. We are very happy with the growth, not only in participation, but also purchases and retention and we had a very successful Prime Day in July that we're really happy. It was a great event for customers and sellers. That's all I have on that. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : All right. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead. Phil Hardin : Hello and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-months operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principle repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million. Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue, compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 5.1%. Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share. Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion. Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 [ph] million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015. We are grateful to our customers and remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions. Phil Hardin : Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from analyst Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju : Hey, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter. And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're - it's been very strong. And AWS revenue is on a, just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4. As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally what we find is that price is important. But so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that were beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015 and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space and we don't take it for granted and we want to serve customers better each year. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from analyst Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter eCommerce, particularly in the US? Did we see more aggressive promotional activity and maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed. And through Q4 [ph] we did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers and in stock in time for the holiday. Another dynamic of Q4 was that it was a huge FBA quarter, nearly 50% of our third party units were FBA and our third party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, up 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses and we were full. It was a very busy quarter and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, primarily in the US, but a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded our - even our expectations. Jason Helfstein : Perhaps how are you able to integrate that into holiday promotions? Brian Olsavsky : I'm sorry. You cut off there. Could you repeat your question? Jason Helfstein : Sure. Just any additional color around Prime and how you were able to integrate that into holiday promotions? Brian Olsavsky : Nothing specific. I will say, you know, one interesting enhancement this year was our Prime Now service, which allowed people order in selected markets up until 11.59 on New Year, excuse me, Christmas Eve. So that was a valuable service to many late shoppers, last-minute shoppers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Aram Rubinson : Hey. Thanks very much. Two questions both on the logistics side. It seems pretty clear that you guys are trafficking in some old world assets, like truck trailers and ship lanes and air fields. Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets? Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Aram. Thanks for your question. I would say what we've found is in order to serve \u2013 properly serve our customers at peak. We've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not meant to replace them. And those carriers are just not - no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. They have been and continue to be great partners. And we look forward to working with them in the future. It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. You mentioned trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those - this past year. We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our source centers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. The first one is just on gross margins. I think they were down of about 200 basis points sequentially. It's the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite sometime. Anything you call out there, is the devices are more - sortation center, is anything pressuring gross margins we should think about in the fourth quarter? And then on the fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the growth in the fulfillment costs. Anything else you would call out leading to incremental fulfillment costs, maybe India or something else? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : No. And again, keep in mind that the fulfillment as a percent of revenue is impacted by the calculation of FBA revenue being a net number as opposed to a full revenue number. But our fulfillment costs per unit actually decreased year-over-year. It just we are now shipping more and more of our, other demand out of our warehouses, because of the strength in retail and FBA. On gross margin, I would - first I'll caution you and say, we would encourage you to look at free cash flow, which was \u2013 grew at minimum of $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out and our profit which was up 88% year-over-year. If you look sequentially, also keep in mind that in Q3 when it was up 500 basis points year-over-year, that was lapping the write-down of our Amazon phone [ph] inventory the prior year. So there is a little bit of noise in the Q3 number. But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4, and the bottom line results that we had. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. Colin Sebastian : Great, thanks. One follow-up and then another question. On the logistics and transportation side, I was curious if that's to date just to supplement some of the other carriers. But more broadly or longer term, is there an ambition from the services side to perhaps provide capacity to other companies. And then on AWS margins, I was just wondering if we should expect more leverage there going forward and whether Q1, whether that should demonstrate some seasonality versus what we've seen in terms of sequential growth in prior years? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me work backwards. We don't give guidance by segment. So we cannot really comment on AWS specifically in Q1. And the operational improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have. So we're very happy with that. Keep in mind that we did have a - although the year-over-year increase in capital expenditures and capital leases was not as great as we saw in 2013 to 2014, we did spend over $9 billion on those, on capital expenditures and capital lease obligations, up from prior year was, excuse me\u2026 Operator : Thank you. Our next question\u2026 Brian Olsavsky : Sorry, let me finish my answer to him, please. We grew up \u2013 we grew from in the $5 billion range in 2013 to $8.9 billion in 2014 and now over $9 billion in 2015. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Senna with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Ken Senna : Hi. So lot of headlines around Amazon's activity at Sundance I just was hoping you could maybe expand once more on the video strategy and specifically are you seeing an inflection in Prime Video usage. And maybe just also on your streaming partners program, what the general reception is like? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video. Again, when Prime Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption and retention, higher free trial conversion rates, and higher renewal rates for subscribers. So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally we doubled the number of \u2013 our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. And internationally, we had twice as member Prime members streaming year-over-year. So very encouraged by the pickup and the response of customers. The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the Amazon Studios content, in particular. We've had some great success in 2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in the Jungle just won two Golden Globe Awards. So very, very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year. Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to. And in February, we will have Chi-Raq, our first original movie that we got to work with Spike Lee on, which won many critical, made many critics' best film list in 2015. That will be coming to Prime Video in February. Phil Hardin : Just to add, this is Phil. On the question about the streaming partners program, so that's our new over the top streaming subscription program for Prime Members. We think it's a really convenient way for them to access additional content, content sources like Showtime and Starz. And it's really early, so it's just out of the gate. But we've been very pleased with what we've seen so far. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : Two things, please. Any callouts on the macro side? Occasionally you called things out, anything this time? And then can you talk a little bit about Amazon business, I know, there is a little bit of a line in the press release on it. I know you've had this for a couple of years. But any indications to materiality of that, the kind of momentum it's gaining, the kind of traction it's gaining? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. No macroeconomic comments. Again, we feel we're very encouraged by the customer response to our offerings in Q4. Amazon business, yes, in April you may remember we launched it as a marketplace with specific features and benefits for businesses. That - Amazon business now serves more than 200,000 businesses from small organizations to Fortune 500 companies. So it's still early, but we're encouraged and we think we're creating some value, a lot of value for our business customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark May : Thanks. Brian, question on international retail business. I think you added well over a billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there. I'm sure there is, there are a lot of different things going on. I just wondered if you could unpack that a little bit and give us a sense of, you know, what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature, established countries and regions, relative to the investments you were making in other countries, so that we can kind of get a better picture of what's actually going on under the hood there? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Mark. Thanks for your question. We are very pleased by the international growth, 22% FX neutral, was up 1000 basis points year-over-year. We saw that the - we told you the Prime growth, Prime membership growth of 50% in-- excuse me, 51% globally, 47% in the US means that the international Prime programs grew at a faster clip than that. So very pleased with the up-tick. We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from FREE Same-Day to Prime Now to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So very happy with that. But in general, if I step back, our investments in national are twofold. First, there's the Prime platform and all the features that I just mentioned, including the fulfillment, adding more fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes and very strong FBA program as well. And then the remainder - the biggest other investment area is obviously India. And we like \u2013 we continue to see, like what we see in India. In Q4 Amazon India was the top e-commerce site in India throughout the very busy diwali shopping season, including the shopping season, according to comScore. And sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4. So seeing great progress with downloads, innovations for sellers and customers alike. And we like the ramp there and we're continuing to invest in India. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Two things. Just first, on the North America EGM growth, if you could just talk about the 28% there and the decel on an easier comp and whether there's any particular factors within that we should be thinking about and perhaps if there was any weather and apparel impact there? And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of being able to invest as you'd like and also deliver good profit and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past. Is that statement and thought still hold as you head into '16? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with EGM. So EGM growth, North America EGM growth of 28% was actually also the highest in the last 4 years. So we're happy with that. The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate. So sequentially last year, any North America EGM we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a - generally a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction. Your other question, investments. Yes. We continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things - businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns, and are durable that can last for decades. We think Prime is that. We think marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So - but as we continue to invest, primarily in. As I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies and fixing variable productivity. I think a thing to think about is the investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, you know, as we look at the slowing growth in AWS, obviously still from an incredibly high level and still very strong growth there. But take - try and take that into context with the growth in margins that you keep seeing in that business to levels that certainly seem a lot higher than you would anticipate for an Amazon business. Is there any capacity constraint or management that, that's driving pricing strategy in AWS? We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about, a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business and just trying to balance those, think about how we should balance those three things? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have - we just announced Korea as a region and we'll be adding five more regions in the next, in the future, in the near future, as we mentioned. CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, particularly in AWS. And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. But there is certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015. But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on, yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business. On a dollar basis, we continue to grow \u2013 we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response. Heath Terry : Sure, sure. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. Kerry Rice : Thanks a lot. First question is if you can provide maybe some context around linearity within Q4, more as a, you know, compares to your expectations, obviously you have a ramp up into the holiday season, but was - did December tail off faster than expected or did the ramp up, did it spike higher than you expected? And then just on the follow-up, maybe can you add some context about how the mobile played a role in the holiday season for Amazon? Thanks. Phil Hardin : So in terms of - this is Phil. In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. So no real callouts there. I think, what was your second part of your question? Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time continues to be a tailwind for the business. We're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy and access, a lot of the features they\u2019ve grown accustomed to on the website. And so we're very focused on the convenience factor. And if you look at some of our new offerings like Prime Now that's available through a mobile app and very convenient for customers. As Brian's mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and then have their items delivered in two hours. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. I have two. I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly about purchasing an asset utilization. But do these explain the 800 bps on a year-on-year margin expansion? And are you seeing anything else? Like, is there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed costs? Is there some benefit from revenue mix shift, like services like Aurora and Redshift growing faster than EC2 or is all the margin expansion due to purchasing and asset utilization? So that's the first question. And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses or cost of revenues to be more precise. Last year you told us they were $1.3 billion, but if you can give us a figure for '15. In lieu of that, can you comment on whether 4Q saw higher than usual costs for streaming content compared to other quarters in the year? Thank you. Phil Hardin : Carlos, this is Phil. So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business. So that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you see in margin year-over-year. There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world. As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year and haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter-to-quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brian Pitz : Thank you. You mentioned Amazon Dash in the press release. Can you give us some color around how you're viewing the traction there both with customers and with brands and devices? And then maybe any update on Twitch. How is traffic and user engagement been trending on that site? Thanks. Phil Hardin : This is Phil. So on the Dash Buttons, we're really excited about what we're delivering there. I think, as you saw in the release, there are some new devices that take advantage of the underlying service that we think will be really convenient for sellers and interesting for device makers. So we're excited about what we're building there. Don't have any stats for you today. On the Twitch side, we continue to let Twitch do what Twitch does best. And so don't have any updates on numbers there. But they continue to really engage customers and offer a really unique experience, which was one of the reasons we were attracted to them to start with. Brian Pitz : And maybe just quickly, end of year fulfillment and sortation centers? Brian Olsavsky : Yes. I'll take that. So we ended the year at 123 fulfillment centers, up a net 14, and we have 23 sortation centers in the US, up four year-over-year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions. Gene Munster : Hey, good afternoon. I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum question and some of your comments, as you mentioned that to kind of expect it to ebb and flow. Could you tell us if you expect it to ebb and flow, but moving higher or is ebb and flow just mean that, that it's kind of undetermined in 2016? And then second follow up is the Robotics, any update in terms of number of robots or how you see that expansion going forward? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, my comment on ebb and flow was more about the investment and also including capital expenditures and capital leases, so not around gross margins. And merely I was pointing out that, again, we've laid out all the invested areas where we're seeing heavy investment. We continue - we see continuation of that certainly into 2016 and beyond. There are quarter-to-quarter and even year-to-year fluctuations in some accounts, and some investment areas. But generally we're pretty transparent on where we're investing our dollars. And then against that backdrop, we are always looking for efficiency and the nice thing about growing the top line at such a high clip is we have a lot more areas for opportunity to save money year-over-year and we always look to do that. Phil Hardin : And this is Phil. On the Kiva question, the last update we've given is more than 30,000 robots. We continue to be really pleased with the program and like what it does in the warehouse, both from a density of storage, as well as from making the jobs easier for the associates who are picking packages, by bringing the packages actually to the associates. But no new numbers on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post : Thank you. Two questions. Was there any category mix impacts in the quarter on gross margins, that's just a quick one? And then secondly, as you look back at last year, you had some quarters where you really exceeded your guidance on the CSOI line. Maybe looking back or just looking forward, what are the types of things that causes you to come in at the high end versus maybe the low end when you look back or when you look forward? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. First, on guidance, we keep it pretty consistent process on how we look at guidance and how we value or how we estimate the near-term view of the business. I will point out that Q4 is obviously a very large quarter, the largest revenue quarter by far of the year. There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well. So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do recall. So reason our best projections on a lot of fronts. We think it's a similar - we know it's a consistent process and there are times when we under run and sometimes we over run it. Phil Hardin : On the - this is Phil. On the category mix question, you know, obviously category mix does play a role in the gross margin. I would say, though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars, as we've probably talked about before. The gross margins are impacted by first party versus third party mix, as well as AWS mix if you're looking at the total for the company. So we're much more focused on the dollars. And no specific categories we're calling out as a driver for gross margin because, again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Paul Vogel : Great. Thanks. Just wonder if you could give an update on the strategy around same-day shipping. How we should think about kind of further expansion of that and kind of what parameters do you guys use to determine what markets to go in? Is it density of the market? Is it proximity of your distribution facilities? Just some color on that would be great. Brian Olsavsky : So we deliver, really quickly, a couple of ways. One is the same-day that you've seen us rollout in number of markets here in the US. There is Prime Now and we're now in more than 25 metropolitan areas for Prime Now. And delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive, but customers love it. So we feel like this is the natural evolution of our delivery and we're happy to invest in that service. You know, we like what it does for Prime members. We like the convenience factor. And so we're taking a long-term approach and doing what we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to ask little more about North American operating margins. Because I think they expanded just under 50 bps this quarter to 4.7%. And that compares to an average of 200 basis points, thereabouts, expansion of the prior three quarters. So I'm just wondering if in 4Q maybe higher FBAs cost or something else in there that led to maybe an expansion not as great as we saw in prior quarters. And then following up on the Prime Now question, just now, I'm wondering how hour-delivery or two-hour delivery has changed customer perception of just delivery overall? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Yes, again, I'll point out that the demand for FBA services was very high, nearly 50% of our third party units, again, were FBA. And the demand for space and services was very large by our seller base, which was great from a lot of standpoints, but did exceed our expectations. But did make our warehouses rather full and did cause us to incur some additional variable costs in the US. And there is also the dynamic that we were fulfilling more of these units ourselves at our warehouses because of the FBA growth and the retail growth. Phil Hardin : On the speed of delivery, this is Phil, you know, all I can say is the customers love the service. It's very convenient, and it gives them flexibility and the ability to get products really quickly. I don't know if there is any big trends we are ready to call out at this point, but they seem to really, really like it. So we're encouraged by that. We're excited to invest in it and excited with what we can do for our Prime members. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Neil Doshi : Great. Two questions, please. And one, it seems like the Echo did perform well. Can you talk more broadly about your Internet of Things ambitions and kind of how Echo plays into that strategy? And then secondly, just wanted to know a little bit more about restaurant delivery. It seems a little bit outside of the wheelhouse. What's the impetus behind doing more in terms of food delivery and what are your ambitions there? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : So on the Echo, we like what - how Echo has done. We're really excited about the ecosystem and some of the skills that are being added to Echo, as well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of Alexa, which is kind of the brains behind Echo. So we like our device business in general. As you probably saw from the press release, we had a good Q4, where we did almost doubled, or double what we did last year. So very excited about the devices. We like that they pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem. Not sure on the Internet of Things, but it's very exciting for devices standpoint. And the brains of Echo are in the AWS cloud. And so, Echo gets new capabilities all the time as Alexa gets better and better. On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point. And so we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods. And so this is one more really valuable convenient service we can offer for our Prime customers. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. John Blackledge : Great, thanks. Two questions. First one, shipping costs were higher than we expected. I think it was 12.5% of net revenue versus 11% last year. Just any color on the higher shipping costs? And is that percentage of net revenue a new normal as we are in 2016 now and as we look out? And then the second question on Prime Now, in 25 markets globally, how should we think about the total number of markets that - additional markets you can enter with the Prime Now offering in 2016? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. As you say, net shipping margin was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Again, this is all tied in with the increase in FBA growth and the demand from Prime members. We're shipping more units \u2013 more of our units, so this ripples through our ship cost per unit, and again, the calculation of ship costs as margin is a percent of revenue and that is impacted by the denominator effect on the FBA sales, being booked at a net revenue. Phil Hardin : Related to your Prime Now question, this is Phil, we're in more than 25 metropolitan locations. It's - if you've been watching, this rollout's really happened in the last year. So it's been a pretty rapid rollout. And we're excited to bring it to more places. We don't have a target for you today, but we are working hard to bring it to more and more places. We're outside the US now in a handful of countries in the UK and Japan, and Italy and working to expand. So it's a program we're really excited about and we're happy to bring it to more customers. Phil Hardin : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2016 only and will include forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial result is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayment increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayment and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligation. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investment in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. A combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had preorders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded $285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units. Now, I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other. In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year. In the International segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million, compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million, compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year. Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $706 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $57 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in the second quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net. We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question? Operator : At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please state your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot. Lots here, but international retail revenue \u2013 the international retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was and how sustainable it is? And AWS, just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in three and a half years. I would attribute it to the Prime flywheel. As we may have mentioned in the past, we feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. So certainly, a lot going on in international, a lot that's really good, adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see devices, you see video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same-Day. Everything is in Europe. It may be getting there a little slower than the starting point in the U.S. but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases. On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside, so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast obviously by segment. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan. Please state your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. But I just was hoping you could comment on the overall acceleration we've seen here and key drivers behind that? And if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on international? And then just also on AWS and can you just talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? And as you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out or something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves? Thanks. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil Hardin. I'll take the units question. So really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described. I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver of revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth, that's been a big area of focus for us. And one important way we drive selection is through FBA, and so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from, obviously that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here, so selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth. On the second part, I think that, Brian... Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, one other comment I didn't say earlier, I do want to point out that because of the leap year there's an extra day in Q1. Every company would have seen this obviously, but we estimated it was worth about 150 basis points to our growth rate revenue. That would be consistent with North America and international. Your other comment was on \u2013 or question was on AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook. We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin on a \u2013 the new basis including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased. But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time. At any point in time they're going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion that he's talked about, price reductions we may offer, and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver in not only this business but also the North America and international segments. Operator : Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. Looking at the active customer account number, it looks like growth slowed pretty significantly, about 10 percentage points. Just curious if you can give us a sense of anything that might be throwing that number off, assuming we're reading it the right way? And then, as you roll out on AWS \u2013 as you roll out the fixed new Availability Zones over the course of this year, is there a way to quantify what kind of an impact that's going to have on the capacity at AWS? Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : So I'll take the first part of your question about active customers. So as we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So this quarter, we only gave the active customers with a paid purchase in the trailing 12 months, and so that number was more than $285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trends that we've seen in that metric. Now in the past, sometimes we had also given a total active customers count, and so that number for this quarter was over $310 million. So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth, but the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those numbers. But we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 Availability Zones in 12 geographic regions, and we have five \u2013 11 more Availability Zones opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we built out those zones. Some of it has already taken place. But I will also say that by and large, the largest increases in capital leases is to support the growth of incremental usage of customers we have now and agreements we have now. So \u2013 and you should expect to see us continue to invest and support this business. We're very, very \u2013 we have a leadership position, we intend to maintain it and we're very excited about where we are. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Two, please. The first one is on Prime. You've two straight years of around 50% Prime subscriber growth. Just curious about how you think about keys to driving Prime sub-growth going forward and the thought process behind the reported monthly Prime subscription? And the second one on logistics investments, so there's been a lot about truck investments and logistics investments. Any comments at all about learnings and what you're seeing from some of the investments in your truck fleet and your own delivery network? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, let me start with the Prime. Yes, we have had very strong growth the last two years and earlier, obviously on Prime growth of members. I would say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. So if you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing tablets where we sold twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year. Fire TV Stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever, 62,000 or over 62,000 of those reviews are five-star reviews. We've not only had the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tab, so we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock. And of course we launched the new Kindle Oasis e-reader. So that is an important part of the story. As it is with digital content, you may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. We love the \u2013 customers love the content and we like the results we see, particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime. So beyond the awards that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly our Amazon Originals, we feel that program is working. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area. Some of that is in Q2, you'll see that more in the next few quarters. But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil Hardin and I'll jump in on the second part of your question. So for the trucks, it \u2013 really it's trailers. The typical use case is running a lag between a fulfillment center and a sort center. So we're running enough volume there that we're using trucks already. We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers, we're actually still contracting out for the truck part. And it gives us flexibility, we think the economics will make sense over time. Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with Air Transport Services Group, an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there, and similar use case, it's products that are already boxed. And we think again, this is activities we've been doing already which need to grow at a very rapid rate. This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers, and we think it makes sense over the long-term. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Two questions related to Prime overseas. Could you talk about the status of Prime in international markets? How far rolled out it is in most of your major markets? And then, you talk about Prime flywheels, and you did last year. But it seems likes those flywheels spun faster than you expected in the fourth quarter of last year that caused some near-term expense issues for you? Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you, how do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, sure. Let me \u2013 this is Brian. Let me start with the second question first. It wasn't necessarily the Prime flywheel that was the issue, it was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses. We were very full. It was a high-class problem to have. But it \u2013 as I mentioned last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result, and I think you'll see some of that dissipated now in Q1, so you could tell it was a Q4 issue. We learn from every Q4, this one was no exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense learnings. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. On the Prime question, we launched Prime in the U.S. in 2005, followed that in 2007 with U.K., Germany, Japan, and then other countries after. We have Prime in all of the countries where we have Marketplaces with the exception of Mexico, China and India. And Prime is really in varying stages in those countries. We have some kind of an expedited shipping offer in all of them. Here in the U.S., we've been talking quite a bit about Prime Now, that's also in Italy and Japan and the U.K. at this point and not others, also varying levels of digital benefits as well. So, generally, the international countries are not as far along with selection or the fullness of the digital offers. We've got Prime Video in the U.K., in Germany and Japan. Music is not fully rolled out yet to all of the others there. So that's where we are with Prime. Operator : Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please state your question. Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have two. I think it's the first time since 1Q 2011 that we see tech and content as a percentage of revenue declining or flat. Is this just a sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or is there something else going on and if yes, what? And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made and are making. And you gave the examples of devices that you guys are selling. I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth. As penetration increases and growth slows, will we see a deceleration in the investment levels? And in other words, how do we think about the effect of deceleration in Prime on the North American margin structure in the future? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Let me start with that second one. So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S. So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. So I don't see that dissipating. And again, it remains the best deal in retail. So hopefully everyone signs up for that. On the tech and content question, I don't have a lot to call out in the quarter. I would say there's no let-up in the pace of invention here, particularly on the AWS side. We usually quote the number of new features and services to you each quarter, we had 214 in Q1, up from 170 the first quarter of last year. So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Please state your question. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for the question. Any comments on your business in India? How is that market ramping up? And maybe on the competitive front there, any sense of where the local incumbents may actually have some advantage in the region? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, sure. Thanks. Actually, I just returned from India where I spent a week with our teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad. We're breaking ground on a new 10-acre campus there. So we are solidifying and increasing our investment in India on all fronts. I had a chance to see firsthand the level of invention going on with both customers and sellers, making deliveries to customers, seeing the I Have Space program we have with merchants. It's a very exciting time in India and again, the invention is off the charts. We are inventing things in India that do not exist in other parts of the country \u2013 excuse me, parts of the world. And the team there is one of our best. You can see it in some of the external commentary as well. For the second year in a row customers selected Amazon India as Amazon's most trusted online shopping brand. During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called Tatkal which is a studio on wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads and basic seller training. So we're taking it to the sellers, taking the business to the sellers. We've already reached sellers in 25 cities and we're really helping them expand their business not only within their home region, but throughout the whole country. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Please state your question. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks. My question is on the international margins. They're quite a bit below where they were many years ago and trailing the U.S. Maybe talk about the dynamics there and what is it going to take to catch up over time? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So, on the op margin side, although there was improvement year-over-year and, yeah, you're right, it is still on FX-neutral basic \u2013 basis negative. We have, as I said earlier, selection expansion, infrastructure investments, fulfillment network and AWS \u2013 excuse me, that's not the international segment \u2013 fulfillment network and digital content. So we continue to build the underpinnings of the Prime program in our international countries. You also have to keep in mind that we're making large investments in India. We're very excited about what we see and we will continue to invest heavily in India. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. I just had two questions on AWS. First, last fall at re :Invent, you guys disclosed that data management revenue was at a $1 billion run rate. So can you provide an update on that figure? And maybe just talk about how much of AWS revenue today is outside of the storage and compute layers. And then the second question is on the AWS margin. So I think everybody is trying to learn more about the structural long-term margin, and it was down a tad quarter-on-quarter. So is that solely from FX impact? Or was there some seasonality of expenses? Any color on what's driving the AWS margin and how we should think about that over the longer term? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'll take your second question first. So again, we had margin expansion year-over-year that was quite significant, from 12.4% to 23.5%. But again, it's very early in this business. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost efficiencies that we're driving. So quarter-to-quarter, it will vary. We are concerned at this point about capital efficiency, returning price to customers periodically with price reductions and adding feature sets for them to make the business more valuable. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. For your other part of your question, we're not providing an update on the $1 billion stat. What I would say is that the AWS team has strong revenue growth across their suite of products. The fastest-growing product in their history is actually Aurora, the new database. So we're very excited about what we're seeing in that space but we're not breaking out the revenue for those various components today. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Investment Research. Please state your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the gross margin, impressive performance in Q1. There were a few headwinds it looked like in gross margin in Q4. Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts and takes in gross margin, it has evolved to be a much higher number over the last couple of years, what some of the puts and takes are going forward especially with respect to content costs? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So I don't have a forecast for you on content costs in isolation or really forward looks on anything besides the guidance I've given you. But, yes, it hits in the gross margin, content costs do show up there. I think the bigger issues that you should look at in gross margin, and again starting with the comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year, that is really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth and again, $10 billion business growing 64% is very \u2013 we're very pleased with that and that affects gross margin as well. The other bigger element though is the third-party contribution. Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units and that's up 400 basis points year-over-year, so that continues to be a factor in gross margin. Again, we book that on a net basis. The third-party revenue, it's a positive factor in gross margin and can be a negative factor in fulfillment costs and some of the other metrics. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. Also just to jump in. The gross margin is not the primary metric we use to measure the business. We are much more focused on free cash flow dollars and operating profit dollars. So there are a whole lot of moving parts in gross margin, and Brian mentioned a lot of them. But it's not a primary metric for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler of Raymond James. Please state your question. Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thanks. Couple of questions. First, if you can just update us on maybe your new advertising initiatives in terms of how the sponsored links are performing? Additionally, if you can just \u2013 maybe just give us an update on Prime Now, it seems like you've rolled out a number of cities for that. How that's evolving and the traction with Prime Now? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, we're very excited about the advertising business, and we think it's still very early days for this opportunity. So it's an offering we've been working on. We're trying to take a very customer-centric approach. You probably noticed some changes in the treatment on the website. And we did move away from text ads and product ads in favor of some of the other newer products. And we are really excited about the opportunity there is for third-party sellers, and for other vendors on the site. But we are not breaking out numbers today. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : In Prime Now, we are now in 30 metro areas, really from a standing start 16 months ago when we opened our first Prime Now location and it's now a worldwide business in the U.S., U.K., Italy and Japan. So the five cities we added in the first quarter were Raleigh, North Carolina, Cincinnati, Tampa, Liverpool, England, and Osaka, Japan. So, yeah, how do we feel about that business? Again, it offers tens of thousands of daily essential products. We think it's a service that customers like, certainly is hard for companies to do. We think the natural evolution of our operations network and our scale gives us a chance to do this and we are happy to invest in it as a service for our customers. We are taking a long-term approach on this one, though. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Please state your question. Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Hi. Thanks. So your capital lease-driven property and equipment acquisitions is down again year-over-year. So, will you help tie this to perhaps the overall usage growth at AWS? Or maybe the changing nature of how your enterprise customers may be using the platform to be more compute versus storage or database-heavy? And I think historically on the e-commerce side, you guys have been price followers as opposed to price leaders. AWS, you have been price leaders for the most part for actively taking down price. So, now, given your leadership position, do you think you'll continue to be price leaders? Or do you think it's now time (35:09)? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Let me start with your CapEx question. So we like to look at both capital expenditures and capital leases because they are both essentially levels with our level of investment. Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, and it was up 7% from the 12-month period ending this quarter last year. I will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion. So we have stepped up investment, although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth, unit growth and FBA, and global expansion and then also on AWS, additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also new regions. We've been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity. It's very important to us, and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency, and better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly. But again, we are spending almost $10 billion. So... Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : And, Stephen, this is Phil. Just to jump on the usage growth comment, we continue to see really strong usage growth. We are not in the business of raising prices, we lower prices for AWS, so there can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, know that we are also lowering prices which means that by math, we are typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate. So I just wanted to jump on that. Operator : Our next question comes from John Blackledge of Cowen & Company. Please state your question. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. So the North American EGM segment outperformed our expectations of growth accelerating on a year-over-year basis. Given you don't break out GMV by vertical within the EGM segment and just given the strong growth at massive scale, can you cite any key verticals that were particularly strong? And second question is just an update on Fresh. Rollout has obviously been much slower than Prime Now. How should we think about the Fresh rollout and the impact over the long-term? Thank you. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. I'll take the EGM question first. So just to put numbers on that, the year-over-year in the U.S. or in North America was 32% growth, which was up from 28% in Q4. And there's not any single categories we're calling out there. To grow on a base that big, that kind of rate, you really need pretty strong performance across the board. So a lot of categories are selling a lot. And it's a lot of the drivers we talked about, as Brian mentioned on the revenue growth side, Prime, selection, growth. And we also benefited from the extra day in the quarter due to the leap year, but strong performance from many of the categories. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes. And on AmazonFresh, we continue to have a strong Fresh business in a number of cities in the U.S. We know customers love it. We're making good progress on the economics. And you'll also notice that we have other ways for people to buy consumable products. We have Prime Pantry. We have Prime Now. So we're playing with a lot of different models to see what resonates with consumers and it'll guide our investment decisions going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie Equities Research. Please state your question. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: First, congratulations on a great quarter. A couple on Prime and one on China. First, a point of clarification. You answered a previous question by saying that you will significantly increase investment in Prime. Was that in reference specifically to video or should we expect new types of offerings beyond video and music? And then, secondly on Prime, membership is likely hitting some saturation levels for certain demographics in the U.S.? Do you intend to focus on more lower income households for growth there? And then finally, quickly on China, anything notable to call out there that's been different over the recent past driving results, the free trade zone, et cetera? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'll take the first question on content. Yes. My comment on Prime benefits was essentially one about video content and our investment there, not saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one that we are focusing on and that I called out. On the comment about Prime, I guess what I'll call availability or... Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Saturation. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : ...saturation, yeah, I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly plan. We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way, if that's how they choose. We've always had our free trial program, but it is a hurdle for many people or there's a hesitancy to put up a full year's payment for a year of Prime. Annual is still going to be a better deal but we know that customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan, and that's what we're looking for. We know that once customers try it, generally, they'll really like it. So we think that will purge (40:38) some other demographic groups as well. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. Another comment on Prime. On your saturation question, keep in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better. I think the monthly offers are great for flexibility, give people a chance to try new ways. And we continue to add content. We continue to add selection. Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist two years ago. So all these things are making the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible. We're obviously very committed to driving Prime and it's important to the company. Your question on China, probably the biggest thing to point to is more progress and selection on the Amazon global store. So this is our website. This is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese-language pages. So it's focused on really items that may be hard to get, and Amazon's really trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods. So really that's a big part of the focus. And if you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over $10 million, which is good progress on that front. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please state your question. Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to North America but this time just focus on margins. 5.5%, 5.4% margins, I think that's the highest level since maybe 2Q 2010 and resumes the margin expansion we saw really for most of last year. So just hoping we can understand \u2013 help us understand a little bit more what's driving that? I'm sure the more mature Prime flywheel you mentioned that's happening in Europe. But is there anything else that's going on besides Prime flywheel, maybe more efficient shipping or things along those lines? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'll start. I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%. It's showing the success we're having with customers. When we grow at that clip, we can do a lot of good things it. We can \u2013 on the cost side, we run our facilities more efficiently, we can buy better, we can look to in-source some things that we may have paid externally for. So, there's a number of things that we can do that I think will show up on the bottom line. But principally, what we're trying to do now is \u2013 again, make the Prime experiences as strong as possible for consumers. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and drive for efficiencies in others. And we're not really trying to optimize for any particular number in a given quarter. We're just trying to make the best decisions we can to grow long-term free cash flow per share. And so, again, we're juggling the investment in the places where we feel like we have long-term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting continuously better in all our other processes at the same time. Operator : Our final question will come from Bob Peck of SunTrust. Please state your question. Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thank you. Just two quick ones. Just back to India for a second, I was wondering if you could talk about the regulatory environment there and particularly how it pertains to Amazon Cloudtail. And then number two, on logistics, could you talk about excess capacity in logistics as you build out air, freight, sea, et cetera. And would you ever entertain delivering other companies' items, i.e., like a FedEx or UPS? Thanks. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : This is Phil. I'll take the India question. We're happy to see the recent clarifications and we're happy to operate in any regime. So frankly, the more clarity, the better. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And then on the logistics question, stepping back, the reason we add logistics capability and transportation capability is so we can serve our customers faster and faster delivery speeds and we've needed to add more of our own capacity to supplement our carriers and our partners. They're still, again, great partners, have been and will continue to be for the future, but we see opportunities where we need to add additional capacity and we're filling those voids. Phil Hardin - Director, Investor Relations : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units. Now I'll talk about our segment results. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million compared with the loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services' revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services' operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015. We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it back to Darin. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: Thank you, Brian. Before we move to questions, I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to be appropriate assumption. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. [Operation Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're kind of accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI, especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just kind of a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yeah, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike. In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity. This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are \u2013 Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by \u2013 units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, so we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year. So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 \u2013 excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally. And we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows \u2013 TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments certainly that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We're not disclosing that at this time. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that. And then also, is there anything else that kind of stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter? And if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that kind of a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015. So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based compensation and other operating expense to our North America, international and AWS segments. So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray. Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon. First, love the conference call format here. Get right to it. In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of guidance on that? And then also talk about the theme of automated consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can kind of grow those SKUs. Thanks. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: Hi, Gene. This is Darin. I'll start with the customer accounts. As we noted again in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million. However, today we're not going to update that number. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : To your question on Prime Now, so I will point out Prime Now is now in more than 40 metro areas worldwide. In the past quarter we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, again, offering free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. We also have in the same vein of, I think what you called maybe automated consumption, the same day has expanded. Now we've added 11 metro areas, bringing the total to 27 metro areas that are qualified for same day. So, yeah, we think this is an important part of our Prime offering. We know customers love it. We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime Now, and very happy with it. Of course, we do always talk about \u2013 we always usually get asked about profitability and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on, but we know customers love it and we're in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network. Operator : Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out? Presumably that kind of increase in capacity likely has an impact on margins, but would appreciate sort of any direction you can share on how to think about that. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. We don't give \u2013 obviously we don't give segment-based guidance. But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next \u2013 in the coming year. The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself. We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps. And we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base. Operator : Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Two questions if I may. As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course it's reflected in the AWS margins. Can you help us understand what has driven this significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying Fresh? What's different between them and how is it that you are deploying Fresh in new markets but not as fast as Prime Now, and what drives the difference? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure cost to run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving cost out of our acquisition prices. So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins. On Prime Now versus Fresh, they are separate \u2013 sorry. The \u2013 we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as two new sites in London for AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as \u2013 it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. The \u2013 it has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of one-hour and two-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So, they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the Echo. Anything you could share at all on some of the most commonly used searches? How are consumers using the Echo as of now most commonly? And then anything on uplift in purchase behavior from Echo households? And the second one on Prime, on AWS margins, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes that have been driving the AWS margin expansion we've seen in the first half of this year? Is it utilization, product mixes? What's been driving the margin expansion? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year. And now we have 1,900 third-party skills for the Alexa, including new skills from Kayak, Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more. So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for Echo. A lot ties into our Prime Music offering. It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from \u2013 through \u2013 excuse me, orders through Echo. On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a \u2013 certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but the \u2013 these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and that's what you're seeing. But we're very happy with the year-over-year improvement. Operator : Next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Hey, Brian, could you give us some wise as to the revenue growth acceleration that you're seeing, a little more color about the revenue growth acceleration in North American retail and in international retail? I remember last quarter you called out really starting to see, kind of I don't know, critical mass tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in international markets. Is that what's continuing, I assume, to kind of drive that re-acceleration? And any geographic country comments behind that? Thanks a lot. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Yeah, I have the same buzzwords for you, Mark. It's really the flywheel of Prime is definitely working. It's simple as that. The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa. FBA is bringing more Prime-eligible selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great traction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we're seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally. Operator : Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald. Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Two questions, please. Brian, your operating income has been come in stronger than expectations, but more importantly, stronger than your own guidance, at least in the last couple of quarters. I was just wondering as you look back at where you guided relative to actual, where do you think that delta was most pronounced? Why wouldn't we assume that maybe, at least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has maybe decelerated a bit? And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main competitor there is doing, i.e., expanding aggressively around the world, you guys have been growing in a more measured manner, is that still the plan or are you guys interested in maybe instead of moving into a few countries, kind of expand globally in one fell swoop? That's it. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know the customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in the second half of the year versus last year's second half, and we're tripling the Amazon Originals content. That Originals content for TV and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals. So, stay tuned for that. I don't have any more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came in the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high volume as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance. But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about level of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers. But we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right \u2013 in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers, and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Mr. Helfstein, your line is live. Ray Mcdonough - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Sorry about that. This is Ray McDonough on for Jason Helfstein. Just on the AWS side, we've been hearing a lot of talk and especially a lot of media reports that larger customers tend to use AWS, they might use Google and Microsoft Azure in tandem in sort of a multi-cloud kind of architecture. Just wondering your thoughts on how you see AWS fitting in the overall ecosystem and kind of your place longer term in the ecosystem. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Well, first of all, we believe customers will choose AWS primarily for three factors, the functionality and pace of innovation that we bring to the table, our partner and customer ecosystem and our experience. We've been in this business longer than anyone. Having said that, there are room \u2013 there's plenty of room for multiple vendors in this business. What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available. You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. And I would say the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. We have had 422 new significant services and features added in the first half of this year. That's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features. So we feel good about the business position we're in and our position with customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, guys. As another follow up on the margins, I was hoping you could comment on any impact from the investments and build out of enhanced transportation capabilities including the air cargo leases. And then secondly, was hoping you could identify any categories within EGM that are becoming more meaningful drivers of growth or at least are an increasing focus on the retail side? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, sure. First, on EGM, I'll just say the growth is across a lot of different products, none to exactly call out here, and we think that a lot of it is, of course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. EGM in North America grew 32%, which was higher than the revenue growth rate, and also grew 36% internationally. So when people join Prime, they are certainly buying EGM in strong quantity. So that continues to grow with the growth of the Prime program. On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting our short-term results. No. The answer is no. We are certainly expanding our service offerings in the transportation side and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods. The plane deal that we were talking about is essentially planes that we're going to be leasing from other companies, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward, but that is to essentially take on the demand for internal flights as we move product around. It certainly will be well utilized. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Pitz from Jefferies. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for the questions. First, on FC build out, is the cost of building centers scaling over time given the use of Kiva, other technologies or general learnings, or are those costs still relatively consistent? And also, we noticed some device sellout in the next four to five weeks, post-Prime Day. Was this a bit of a planned inventory reduction for some of the devices or did volumes take you by surprise here? Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I will start with the second question. So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers. So it was the largest device sales day that we've ever had and essentially pretty much across all of our device types, E-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. And I'm sorry. Your first question was around \u2013 the cost of fulfillment centers. Not disclosing that we do continue to change our fulfillment centers. We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times and we continue to learn and grow there. So no general trends I can point to on cost per fulfillment center to start up because they do vary in size and mission and some have fully outfitted in using Amazon Robotics, others \u2013 some don't for economic reasons. Maybe the volume is not perfect for robot volume. But yeah. But, yes, so I can't give you any real distinct trends there. Operator : Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thank you. First on the customers, I'm guessing \u2013 I'm wondering why you aren't giving the number, a lot of people use it for their models. And then second thing, when you look at the U.S. Prime penetration versus total U.S. customers, how do you feel about that and do you think there's still a lot of room for Prime growth in the U.S.? Thank you. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: Hi, Justin. This is Darin. I'll comment on the customer accounts again. We may consider updating that in the future, but really we encourage you and our investors to look at our free cash flow measures, our revenue and our GAAP operating profit since our customer purchasing behavior can vary. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And on Prime penetration, of course, we haven't released Prime subscription levels. We have talked about growth certainly globally and in North America. What I can tell you there is we still think there's a lot of room in Prime. We've tailored programs to students. We've tailored video programs. We've rolled out monthly plans. We have plans with grocery delivery. So there's a lot of different flavors of Prime and we are aggressively looking for a perfect Prime for everybody. We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it. So it's really just about getting them to try Prime and continuing to deliver great Prime benefits and great low prices and selection. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. I just had two. First as a follow up on the logistics topic. So, in addition to the cargo planes you just mentioned for in-network moving products around, you guys have registered and received a U.S. Maritime license to operate as a freight forwarder and you recently announced this partnership with the UK for drone delivery that you've been working for a couple years. So I guess at a high level, can you just talk about the overall logistics strategy is evolving from trucks and fulfillment centers to incorporate some of these new methods and how that might impact your unit costs going forward? And then the second question's on AWS. So you continue to put up really strong results. And you guys obviously talk to a lot of customers across lots of different verticals. Just a high level, what percent of enterprise workloads do you think have shifted to the public cloud at this stage? Is it low-single digit to mid-single-digit? And any color there on where we are in terms of penetration in the space. Thank you. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: So thank you, Ross. This is Darin. Let me take that first question on Prime Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers. And we're extremely happy to partner with the UK government to advance the safe use of drones for small parcel delivery. This is providing us with permission to trial new methods in the space, including beyond line-of-sight operation, sense-and-avoid technologies and flights where one person operates multiple drones. So we definitely appreciate the pragmatic and forward-looking approach on this topic with the UK and we're going to continue to work with regulators and policy makers in many countries, including the U.S. So we're excited about there. As for the ocean-going licenses, we have no comment on that today. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : As far as AWS, essentially penetration question you asked. We think still very early. Again, we like our position, our industry leading position in the cloud space, and we're working on things that would incent more and more customers to accelerate their cloud conversion. The lower prices and services that we offer, and as I said, we'll work on things that will make it easier and easier for customers to work with us with their hybrid data centers or transfer their volume to us. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one clarification and one big picture topic. On the clarification, appreciate the disclosure on content and how that'll double year-on-year in the second half. For purposes of just making sure we sort of can understand the trajectory, is there any way to frame it within second half of this year versus first half of this year, just so we can sort of try to triangulate on a gross margin basis from the content spend? And the bigger picture topic would be China, hasn't come up yet on the call. Wanted to understand your latest thoughts there on either the competitive landscape relative positioning in China and how you think about investments in China. Thank you. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: So, hi, Eric. This is Darin. I'll take the second question on China. So we continue to operate well in China. We see China as a \u2013 and the way we're approaching China as a way to \u2013 a trusted avenue for our Chinese customers to access authentic international brands and we'll focus on those global brands and bringing those to Chinese customers. Offerings like the Amazon Global Store where Chinese customers can access those international brands on the China website and have them shipped directly to their houses is something we're focused on. So, yeah, it's still early days and some of those experiments that we're doing, but we're seeing good traction on those things and we like that. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah and on the content spend, I think the only other data point I can give you is probably a dated one at this point, but we spent $1.3 billion in 2014, that's the last number that we disclosed and we continue to add content. The best I can give you at this point is that it will be double, nearly double what we spent in the second half of 2015. Operator : Our final question will come from Victor Anthony from Axiom Capital. Victor Anthony - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.: Thanks for putting me on. Maybe I'll just ask a question about India. You called out India was \u2013 you had the most visited e-commerce site as well as the most downloaded mobile app, and you also launched Prime. So maybe you could just talk about the opportunities and the challenges that you see in that market. And second, there was some press reports that you invested about $500 million of incremental capital in Italy. I was wondering what are you seeing in that market that justifies that level of investment. Brian T. Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in India, both with customers and also sellers; that's a (40:18) third-party seller market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll now have unlimited free one-day and two-day delivery, and we also mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content. We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships. Recently, we've had partnerships with Motorola, Samsung, Lenovo on select phones. But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like our team there. We have a great team of Amazonian's who've been very inventive in India. Every time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the U.S. or another major business they'll invent around it, whether it's a shipping method or a payment method or whatever. So, very creative and the customer response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different. So we're looking forward to seeing what we can do on behalf of the Indian customer. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: And hi, Victor, this is Darin. On Italy, yes, we continue to invest in Italy and really throughout Europe to keep pace with the strong customer demand we see. Since opening Italy in 2010, we've invested over \u20ac450 million and created 1,700 jobs in Italy, and this increased investment will be to add future FC near Rome and other infrastructure assets. So, yes, this is really to support both the customers that we have there in Italy and throughout Europe, and we'll continue to invest in the coming years. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon: So thank you for joining the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you.",

Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metric and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2016, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal segments. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please state your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. The International retail segment margin was the lowest we've seen in quite a while. I was hoping you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Doug. Yes, specifically to International, we are seeing expansion to support selection, expansion at fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits, fresh location Prime Now. But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers. So that is essentially the International margin guidance in Q4. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression of margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat-lining of overall margin at this point excluding AWS, I guess should we think about this as being a temporary kind of plateau that will at some point resume once you start leveraging the fulfillment build-out? Or is there something structurally or philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Gene. Well we will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm about to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year. And it continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3 we added 18 fulfillment centers and we've added five more in October. For the year we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I would look, looking back the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes. Because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth which includes what we ship, includes FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we continue to build for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation and delivery centers. So it's pretty much our customer service centers. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports operation. So those will dissipate as as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial startup costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established mature buildings, so there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question and I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past, I think you've talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies, so with these new FCs opening, could you just talk about it? Have you become more efficient so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage? Or should we still kind of think about it's going to take time to get to up to peak efficiency? And then the second one, AWS. Amazon is a company that is very good at removing friction in the purchase process. Could you just talk about some of the main hurdles you still have to overcome for large enterprises to really start using AWS more? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So the fulfillment network as we built it, yes, they'll be more productive next year than they are this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity add additional cost to Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we build the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is a key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger and then that's a self-reinforcing where Prime then \u2013 the Prime success attract mores sellers. So we're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, yeah, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers in addition to the technologies that make integrations easier that helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS. So we're going to continue to do that, specifically things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime. And also many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS Schema Conversion Tool which really switches database engines to get out of old guard proprietary databases and onto AWS. And so we'll continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions. We've opened up Ohio this past quarter and we've highlighted that we'll have another number of regions coming online in a few months. So yeah, were doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Hey, Brian. Would you give us any commentary on two categories, in particular groceries and fashion and apparel? And particularly on groceries, I know in the release there's a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out into newer areas like Maryland, great to see that. But could you just talk about that in the investment horizon? Is that moving the needle for you? And how big that, any way to help us quantify how big that already is to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comments on fashion and apparel, same line of thinking? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Okay. Sure. Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. So yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. and we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time where we're at, continuing to add zip codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it's a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after. Similarly, but not exactly the same is the Prime Now business, which has similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model obviously where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in one to two hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across seven countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon Restaurant Delivery to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. and that's up from two last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of the geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about. We continue to make it easier for brands and manufacturers to come on board in that category. We continue to work with brands to come on board and we're happy with the traction we're seeing with those brands. And as we get more and more selection, we're really pleased with the customer engagement that we have there, both from the discoverability, the technology that goes behind making it easier to shop for fashion on our site as well as the increased selection by adding the brands. Operator : Thank - Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sorry. To answer your question about was that part of investment. Yes, this is certainly part of our investment but the large ramp, if you will, in investment that we're seeing from the back end of last year and also the first half of this year is more related to digital content and the build in our fulfillment network, which I've already discussed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot. In some of these incremental investment areas like warehouses, logistics and also content, I know in some cases you expense up front. In some cases you amortize over time. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of the recent step-up is kind of being expensed. I'm particularly looking at your COGS as a percent of retail revenues which was up year-on-year for the first time in quite a while. How much of that was because of content that was expensed in the period? Just trying to kind of better understand that. And I think also you've been changing around, and this is happening here shortly, FBA pricing including increasing your storage fees but also reducing your handling fees. I guess the question is, are these changes designed to just pass through kind of increasing shipping costs? Or is this more of a net-neutral change where really the goal is to try to free up capacity in some of your facilities? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with your second question on FBA. So yes, we did make some changes to the pricing formula for this holiday season. They're essentially meant to incent the right behavior among sellers around holiday. And the biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year. So we are trying to incentivize that behavior. We're also trying to incentivize getting inventory into the warehouse quicker. So yes, the formulas were, or excuse me, the changing to the pricing formulas were really with that in mind to help the flow and the base utilization in Q4. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, hi Mark. This is Darin. On the capitalization point, I'd say the things we capitalized are the core buildings and leasehold improvements in the buildings. But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building and I think that's what Brian's pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting the profitability of the second half. So yeah, the capitalization's relatively small in terms of, other than in the building itself. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. With the step-up in investments in content from Prime Video that you mentioned before, would you also be stepping up the international expansion? Maybe you can just remind us how many countries you're in with Prime Video and whether there is a potential chance of maybe stripping Prime Video from Prime to allow it to be extended to other countries. And then I know you're not guiding to 2017. But just looking at the capacity increases that you've had for FCs for 2016, should we expect kind of that as an ongoing expense going forward? Or is the current buildup enough to maybe give you some spare capacity to cool that down for 2017? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So first on your video comment. We're in four countries right now, the U.S., UK, Germany and Japan. And we have stated that we will be in India soon. So the content that we are creating, especially through Amazon Studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in other countries as well. And the cost of that then gets amortized to those countries. It becomes part of the International segment results. So yes, and we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to, versus licensing many times by country, the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves. Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year. We will do that obviously at the end of next quarter. But I would say this was an extraordinary step up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units but Amazon fulfilled units. So really, our forecast for additional capacity additions and the rate of additions will be tied to those growth factors as well. So we'll have to see. We right now are working on getting the capacity in. It was very lumpy this time with 18 warehouses in one quarter and another five in the first three weeks of the next quarter. So ,and obviously we'll be working on the efficiencies of all the warehouses we have, including the ones we just started up this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. A follow-up on the FC question, and I guess more specifically it sounds like you have enough capacity in terms of fulfillment centers for the holidays, but also wondering what your comfort level is in terms of your shipping partners to manage those deliveries. And then secondly, was wondering how you would characterize the pricing environment for AWS, in particular with more deep-pocketed competitors in the space now. Google in fact highlighted this on their conference call today. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with transportation. So yeah, we looking forward to a great holiday and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally. We've worked very closely with them to line up capacity, share capacity plans. We certainly have additional delivery capability of our own. But with all of our partners, we work well in advance of the holiday to get our plans in place. And we feel very confident. We're looking forward to a great holiday not only for customers but also for sellers. On your question on AWS, I didn't listen to the Google call, but you'll have to fill me in on that later. The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is, price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only did we lower the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well. So if you step back and say why do people choose AWS, I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We have added more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've read about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better can support customers. And finally experience. We've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else, and we've used that time to make our products and services better. So there was going to be a lot of winners in this space as we said, but we are very happy with our position and the customer reception to our products. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. I guess when you look at fourth quarter guidance and you back out AWS, it suggests that margins are, on the core business, are going to be pretty down versus last year. Do you view this as a abnormal investment cycle, or just part of the overall kind of ebbs and flows of the business? And then long-term, I know several years ago you talked about maybe high single digit, low double digit margins long term. I wonder if you could refresh us on that, and also just let us know if you think International has structural margin differences than the U.S. in the core retail business. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes. As far as the continuation of the investment into next year, I cannot give you much color on that today. What I can tell you again is that we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend. So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll continue to invest in as particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our consumers. We believe that's working. We're very happy with the results. We're very happy with all the customers we have but particularly the Prime customers that we have. As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for our AWS business either. We are again working on two fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient, as profitable as possible while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things that customers will love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission. We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace, AWS and Prime and we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. I was just wondering, there have obviously been some headlines since the call that you did earlier with the press on the scale of this investment cycle relative to other investment cycles that you've been through. With the 2014 cycle sort of being the most recent, could you quantify a little bit more how you would compare this investment cycle to that most recent one? And to the extent that we are in the midst of this investment cycle, would you say we're in sort of the earlier or later stages? Any sort of clarity around that would be useful. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes. The word cycle, if I mentioned that, was a omission. It was a mis-speak. The investment that we are seeing is a step-up versus what we have experienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the second half of last year which I mentioned. But we have said investments are going to be lumpy. They are going to be high sometimes and they'll be moderated at other times. We are right now, the second half of this year looks like a big step-up compared to the first half and it is. But again, it's all areas that we will continue to invest in, some of which I just actually went through the laundry list. So I would not characterize it as a cycle. I would characterize it as continued investments. We make investments with the idea that they are going to pay off and they pay off in either directly in the business they're in or in their contribution to the total business many times as a part of the Prime program. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, just two questions. It seems you're increasing your efforts in the auto vertical with the recent launch of Amazon Vehicles. Just wondering if you could discuss some of the dynamics of the auto industry that make it attractive and maybe how it aligns with the Prime value prop. And also wondering if you had any plans to work directly with auto shops just given your ability to service most areas in one to two days. And then just the second question, on grocery would you consider physical locations in an effort to kind of expand and/or accelerate the growth in that vertical? Thank you. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, hi John. This is Darin. On vehicles, Amazon Vehicles is really a car research destination and really builds the automotive community for customers and gets information they need when shopping for vehicles offsite or shopping for parts and accessories onsite. The features include research tools, community engagement where you can talk to other customers, and certainly we'll try to build a one-stop shop for vehicles as an extension to the automotive store which engages customers to add information about their cars in their garage and which makes it actually easier to shop for parts and accessories for your particular vehicle. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity there to add convenience for customers. On the B2B side, certainly we do have a Amazon business offering. Businesses of all shapes and sizes can sign up to be a B2B customer and the selection that we have in our parts and in automotive categories are certainly open to that channel, but I wouldn't speculate on anything we might do in a particular vertical for those business customers. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. And your comment on, or question on grocery and physical stores, I can't comment on any rumors or speculations there might be regarding that. But what I will tell you is we have experimented with physical stores. As you may know, we have three physical bookstores, one Seattle, one in San Diego and one in Portland and two more coming, one in Boston and one in Chicago. And what we're finding is they're great places for customers to browse what ends up being a curated selection of books and they also get to try out our devices, which is very beneficial. So they get to touch and try our eReaders, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. So we like what we see with that connection and we also have pop-up stores that you may see and also college pick-up points. So we will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Given the low unemployment rates that you're seeing in the U.S., do you expect any unusual impact on wages for seasonal workers this year? And are you seeing overall wage pressure in the fulfillment centers? And then separately, if you could just talk about trend lines you're seeing in paid units versus shipping units. Are they diverging meaningfully versus the past? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, so on wages, nothing to point out for this holiday. Our challenge generally is the volume of head count that we're looking to hire and we work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. So nothing specific on the wage pressure front. As you probably saw, head count is up 38% year-over-year in Q3 and that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles they're supporting this high demand, the opening of the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. But also a lot of hiring in our tech areas particularly around AWS and also the Echo, Alexa areas. Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And the second, the second question? Operator : Sorry. Go ahead. Okay. And our final question will come from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Can you just provide a little more color into the investments that you're making in India? What's driving that growth and what stage is India in today relative to some of the other large international markets that you've launched in the past? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in India but it is certainly very early on still. Most recent highlights would be the launch of the Prime program in India this past quarter. It's now one of the top selling units based on Amazon.in. And so it's very been very well received by customers. It's hard to compare India to any other country. It's very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has caused a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or something that has not existed in another country, they create it themselves, whether that's from delivery stations to working with small merchants to, you name it. So we're very happy with both the customer engagement that we're seeing and also the seller engagement which is very important in India and very pleased with the team that runs it over there and the way they work with teams throughout the world. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: And Brian, to step back to Ben's other question on units. Ben, this is Darin. I will, so you know, paid units grew at 28% again this year as it did in the prior quarter. And as Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN unit, our Amazon fulfilled units, which include our first-party units as well as FBA units that go through our warehouses are continuing, are certainly higher than that 28%. And that's a result of the traction we're getting with our FBA sellers. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: So thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor relations, Darin Manney. Please, go ahead. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And just briefly before we move to questions, I'd like to address our Form 10-K that we'll be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures. We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1. These changes relate to our entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the financial results that we report for the company or our segments. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is coming from John Blackledge with Cowan. Please proceed with your question. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the question. So, the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins kind of at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So, just wondering if you could frame in order, if possible, the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well. We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately \u2013 excuse me, yes, on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact which brings the non-FX adjusted rate down to \u2013 excuse me, range down to 14% to 23%. I will also point out that we have the leap year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day of leap year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year, that reverses. So we have 150-basis point headwind to growth. And that's been factored into our guidance range. But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about, in prior calls, about the fulfillment center step-up. We had 26 warehouses we added last year. 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content and marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices. And finally, I guess, I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Questions on video. I was wondering if you could just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017 as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly. And then separately as it relates to just the video service, from a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer-term? Is it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look out on Prime Video is customer usage patterns and in 2016 we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we're happy with the engagement that customers have. We're also happy with the \u2013 especially on the Studios side, the people we've been able to work with, some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we've created. We've garnered awards, of course, but mainly that what we're focused on is good content that is attractive to customers. I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last \u2013 or, excuse me, in Q4. And what we see there is again, original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we'll be. But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries. And this takes us to over 200 more countries. So we're very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing. And that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Can you discuss what you're doing to help merchants in China sell and ship directly to consumers in the U.S. and other developed economies and how that business has been evolving over time? Thanks. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, hi, Ben. This is Darin. Yes. We're very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well. The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement. And we have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there as we continue to focus on great offerings through the AmazonGlobal Store, which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there's a mix of things going on in China and we're happy with what we're seeing in both of those. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Just a follow-up on India and China. I know you are investing a lot. I'd love to hear how much, but you probably won't tell us. But can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer-term? And then China, can you give us any updates there on how financial performance is doing and if you've changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there this year? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with India. So, it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years. We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there. So we've had success with [technical difficulty] (10:55) we've been in. We don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We're bullish on India longer-term and it's early. But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, and this is Darin. On China, like I said, we're very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers. So we'll continue to focus on the Global Store there. As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China and that we're pleased with what we're seeing there. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Two primary questions. Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third-party and within that, the growth in FBA is having on these sequential growth rates? To the extent that there's 150-basis point impact from leap year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third-party is having on the growth rate for the first quarter for what you've reported in the fourth quarter? And then on the AWS side of the business, with the price cut in November, can you give us some sense of what impact the price cut had on the deceleration in growth compared to the impact that presumably it had in driving incremental volume to the platform? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with that second question first. So more basically, on AWS, very happy with the response from customers. I feel we've got a very broad base of customers from startups to small-medium businesses to large enterprises to the public sector. And we're continuing to see strong growth across all those sectors. The business is now a $14 billion annualized \u2013 running at a $14 billion run rate. You are right that we had seven price cuts in Q4, essentially timed for December 1, so about 1/3 of the impact was seen in Q4. But that's going to be constant in this business. We've been pretty clear that this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving price cuts and then working on the operating efficiencies. So, very pleased with Q4 and the pace of the business. The new services and features last year were over 1,000 versus 700 or so the \u2013 excuse me, in 2015. So we continue to innovate on behalf of customers. We're working with some very large customers in each industry. You've seen probably press releases on companies like Capital One, Workday, Salesforce and others. So, again, widespread usage and new customer adoption, which is great. Your second question on FBA, I can't break out the year-over-year difference there. What I will say the impact of FBA on our business is and first that's one of the things that we look at is how well are we attracting new FBA sellers, because again, FBA reinforces Prime, Prime reinforces FBA. It's a good flywheel and we added active sellers in FBA grew 70% year-over-year in 2016. So we're very happy with the continued adoption of FBA and what that does to Prime, eligible selection for Prime members. The other data point I'll give you that affects our cost structure is our Amazon Fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew nearly 40% last year and that compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in Q4. I'm giving you a Q4, not a full year number, but they're similar in relative proportion. The fulfillment center expenses and a lot of our shipping costs are tied to the increase in that FBA percentage and that growth of Amazon Fulfilled units. So that is certainly a factor that we consider a positive from a customer standpoint and it's one from a cost standpoint that we certainly continue to work on every day. But that's about \u2013 I think that's the most I can give you on FBA at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Maybe as a quick follow-up on the quarter, we've heard from other e-commerce companies and retailers about a higher degree of promotional activity during Q4. So I wonder if there was any conscious decision on your part to pull back from some of the more aggressive discounting. And then my whether question is whether you can shed any more light on the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the need to support the growth of the core retail business, but also if this gives you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for example, or a longer-term offer excess capacity or logistics as a service. Thank you very much. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Colin. On your first question, holidays are always a very promotional period. So we don't see \u2013 I can't really comment on the year-over-year differential in promotional activities to us. We are always looking to not be beat on price. We want to offer the best options to customers and we saw a lot of great response from customers this holiday season. I think we would be a very trusted holiday partner particularly as you get closer to the holiday. So, on the promotion side, we don't consider it a huge factor either way. It's pretty much a cost of doing business 12 months a year for us. And, sorry, the second question is on the hub in Cincinnati \u2013 or excuse me, in Kentucky. Yes, that is \u2013 I saw the announcement on that. That is a partnership we have to build out the facility at the Hebron, Kentucky airport. I think it'll create thousands of jobs over time. What it does for us is it gives us a base for future growth. It's all about supplementing our existing capacity both our partners and ourselves and essentially building capacity that can handle this top line growth and also the growth in AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units which as I just mentioned is even higher than our paid unit growth. So same as some of the investments you saw in airplanes last year, our partnerships with companies that do air cargo. This is about supplying our need for our customers and our sellers. We value the partnership with external, the external providers as well and I think we're all dealing with the problem of having lots of incremental volume year-over-year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Just a question on paid unit growth. For the last several quarters here, it's been accelerating on a year-on-year basis and I think this quarter 24%, it was below the 26% that you reported in Q4 of 2015. Just kind of curious what had been driving the acceleration over the past few quarters and what may be changed this quarter? And then in terms of the Q1 revenue guidance, wondering if you could provide a little bit of color in terms of the impact that maybe the recent AWS price adjustments are having on your Q1 guidance. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with the second one. So we factored it in, obviously, into the numbers I gave through guidance, the timing of it was again closer to December 1. So there'll be an incremental differential in Q1 on those price cuts, but this is something that we again have quite frequently and I don't think it's a large factor in Q1. The bigger one is more mechanical that leap day comp I would say. And just if you're looking on a non-FX adjusted basis, the foreign exchange exposure, which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 basis points expected in this guidance. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the unit growth, we're very happy with the 24% unit growth that we saw in Q4 like you mentioned. Our unit growth has been strong and that's primarily attributable to our Prime program and the customers and members that enjoy that program. As Brian mentioned, that 28% is only part of the story. Our Amazon Fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers and which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales and it grew nearly 40% over 2016. So we're very pleased with those results and happy with the fundamentals of the business from that perspective. Customers continue to respond very well to the low prices. The vast selection which is helped by the FBA sellers and the strong convenience that we can offer through FREE Two-Day Shipping and the multitude of other faster shipping options such as Same-Day, Next-Day and in some cases with Prime Now, the 1-Hour Delivery to 2-Hour Delivery. So Prime membership and selection continues to drive growth and you'll see that in our unit growth numbers. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk obviously about border tax. I was hoping that you could give us some of your initial thoughts there and how you might think about some of the key considerations around a potential border tax. And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about fulfillment centers. You mentioned the 26 fulfillment center buildout in 2016. Any color that you can give us in terms of how you're thinking about that for 2017? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On the first one, we have a long-standing practice of not commenting on regulatory or tax matter. So I'm not going to comment on any proposed issues out there. We certainly keep an eye on external issues and weigh in when we think it's going to impact our business. But, your \u2013 sorry. Your second question was on FCs. We will continue to invest in FCs. The comparable I'll give you is that I won't forecast 2017, but the 20% growth in square footage that we saw in 2015 was followed by 30% square footage increase in 2016. That generally went to service that 40% growth in units, in AFN units. It also included some of the additional logistics delivery stations and all, too. So it's not all FC capacity, that's square footage. But I would say that we are going to continue to invest in fulfillment centers as long as our AFN growth rate maintains high, and we certainly want to keep that high and growing. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Two questions, please. First, any comment on customer growth qualitatively, how that's trended, how that trended throughout the year, accelerated, consistent, decelerated? And then, would you be willing to give any commentary on the engagement impact you're seeing from all of these Echo devices that are getting into households? Are you seeing people shop more? Are they engaging more with other parts of Amazon? Just any sort of impact on what people with these Echo devices do that's different than Amazon customers that don't have them. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the Echo. So I don't think I'm going to answer your exact question there on quantifying the retail sales through Echo devices. It's still very early days on that, so that's not material. But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have. We do look at engagement and we like the engagement of customers who have Echoes. But let me step back a minute and give some highlights on that, Alexa and Echo together. As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echoes grew nine times, 9x, year-over-year during the holiday period. So, great customer adoption. We're really glad to see that and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there. We've added 4,000 skills to Alexa since I last spoke to you in October and we're working with a lot of major companies as they add abilities, too, for our customer base to use the Alexa or the Echo to reach them. Tens of thousands of developers are building new skills for Alexa. So, the skills addition should continue. And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect. We're doing that ourselves. If you've seen in the quarter, we added Alexa capabilities to our tablets and Fire TV devices, making them better. So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the customer count, no absolute number to give this quarter. As you know, back in Q1 we gave an active customer count that exceeded 300 million and I can say it's still growing and we're pleased with the number there. What we do like is the engagement with Prime. We continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and in particular the Prime program. So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is just on the last mile, the logistics build. Can you help us at all on what you're seeing in some of these markets like the UK where you have more of the last mile buildout done on your own? Is there anything you're seeing about Prime behavior? What are the advantages and even the challenges you're facing as you're building out the last mile? And then secondly, on the brick-and-mortar stores, any learnings, and strategically, just talk to the strategic advantage of having a bigger Amazon storefront. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with your first question. So as you point out, we've had Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other countries and what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer. We can, again, shift order cutoff times out and time is valuable to us because, again, we can avoid split shipments, we can avoid other costs of acceleration. And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network. But I've driven with drivers in Downtown London and it's a very interesting experience. I think it's a great value to our customers. It's interesting to see the route density that we see in the high cities \u2013 or, excuse me, in some cities and the challenges and the upside of that. But I would say essentially, in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the end delivery in markets where we use it. The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time. So that's essentially my overview of Amazon Logistics. Sorry, your second question was on \u2013 oh, the stores, sorry. Yes, you probably noticed we launched the \u2013 we opened the Amazon Go Store in Seattle in the fourth quarter. We think that is very interesting. It's only one store at this time. But it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars; computer vision, sensor, fusion, deep learning. So it's a great accomplishment by that team. It's in beta right now and we like the promise of that. Probably more advanced and further along are the Amazon Bookstores. We have three physical stores; Seattle, San Diego, and Portland right now. We see adding five more this year. So we're still in that phase where we're testing and learning and getting better, even on the bookstore. I would say there's other things that are physical in nature, the pop-up stores and college pickup points that we learn from as well, and think creates a great value particularly at the college pickup points. So not much projection beyond where we are today except for the fact that we will be adding more bookstores. But we test, we innovate, we think the bookstores for instance are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans. So we see a lot of value in that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Two questions. As we think about investment in the first quarter in 2017, any color how to think about domestic versus international. You did give some comments about India, but just any other color or how to think about it? And then on AWS, you announced both new products that reinvent at the low end and at the high end. Any commentary on if that impacted the types of customers who you've been adding on AWS with those new products. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year. Most of those 26 warehouses we talked about. We see that being more balanced over time and being more global as we move forward. Video content is with the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well. And, of course, we had Prime Video in some of our existing countries prior to that. So that is going more global and will be more balanced. As we see devices roll out to other countries, same thing. So I would say over time it will become more balanced and probably what you've seen in the short run tended to be more North America focused. But I can't give you a great split of \u2013 I'm not giving you the absolutes anyway, so I can't give you a great split of the two. And I will also say that we are \u2013 not all of our investments are on the consumer side. AWS continues to expand their global footprint. Last year, we added regions in the UK and Canada. We now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions and we will continue to grow that business globally. And India, again, we've mentioned, but that is, obviously, an international investment. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: On the customer split, we serve \u2013 in AWS, we serve millions of active customers along the spectrum of large enterprise companies as well as small startups and the public company \u2013 or public environment as well. The multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting \u2013 just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years. And so we're really happy about the engagement of reinvent and the participation in that conference as well as the engagement of the new services that we've launched in Q4 and all of 2016, really. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can ask. One, the other North America revenue line in our view has a lot of advertising revenue in it and that line continues to sort of show a lot of momentum, come in better than expected. Can you talk holistically sort of short-term, medium-term, long-term about how you think you're approaching an advertising business across your broad properties, what that might become longer-term and how that might impact the P&L? And then one housekeeping item, anything to call out as an impact from demonetization efforts in India in either Q4 or Q1? Thanks so much. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, sure. I'll take the advertising question. So yes, it's very early in the advertising space. But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that is a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience. I would say Sponsored Products is off to a great start. I find it a very effective way for advertisers to reach interested customers. We also, on video, have not added much in the way of advertising yet. There's some pre-roll as we call it. But for the most part, we like the progression. We are balancing customer experience with advertising at all times and we like the team that's working on it. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: And on other revenue, I just want to call out, there's a number of things going into that particular line. These things include revenue from our co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly display advertising. We have other types of advertising that's spread out throughout the P&L, whether that's a kind of shared marketing investment from our vendors which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales, or it's related to other seller advertising which is generally within the EGM and media categories. And so I'd say other revenue incorporates a number of things, not just advertising. And on India demonetization, nothing particular to call out today on that. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question. Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. It's about Prime Video. You said you were pleased with the hours of engagement. My question is do you think that the hours of video stream need to accelerate from here to get to an adequate return on the invested capital in video? Or are you happy with those returns with the current levels of engagement? And then relatively on Prime Video, could you just talk about your ambitions to potentially extend the video offering beyond on-demand and into possibly a virtual cable bundle? And then finally, just a question of do you need to aggressively partner with distributors, whether they be cable distributors or hardware device companies in order to get better distribution of the Amazon Prime Instant Video app and content to your customers? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, I can't add too much or won't add too much on the last two questions. But I will say on \u2013 you're talking about the levels of engagement now that we're seeing versus what would be the long-term model over time. We're certainly spending ahead of the value of the engagement right now, but it's a good sign that it's building. And an important step was that global Prime program that we launched in the fall \u2013 excuse me, in Q4. As I said, it's very much a fixed expense game, especially with original content. That fixed amount can go up or down, but the ability to amortize it over a large population is what we're looking for. So, we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again both to amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original content to more and more people, because we think it's done really well. We think it's won a lot of awards and we've worked with some \u2013 again some great, talented people. And it's our ability to scale that and to amortize it over a much larger customer base, which will help us in the future. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.",

Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to re-classify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question Operator : At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. . Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.: Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was \u2013 a new version of it was launched in India with some important features there such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.: Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international profitability? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year we said that was a 40% \u2013 nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not big books view of the margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly on these \u2013 on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions. That's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement \u2013 as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers \u2013 the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So \u2013 and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have \u2013 we're now multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and the movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to extend our cutoff times from 3 :00 p.m. in most cases till midnight. So, greater control of our processes. If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we have announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have \u2013 you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had \u2013 customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we continue to expand geographically. We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appearing on the site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers. While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms. And that's what happened. Advertising remained strong and was consistent growth with Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the growth in your cash deployment as an indicator of the ongoing growth? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our \u2013 we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to support the usage growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was \u2013 grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last \u2013 fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up. On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that part of the step-up in CapEx was to catch up from the under-investment in 2015. Just curious if you'd say \u2013 have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're \u2013 it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content \u2013 video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers \u2013 for FBA sellers. So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides. So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. What does that say about the way customers are changing in the behavior in the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be impacting pricing, mix, near-term growth? Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it \u2013 we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the \u2013 part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances. As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. Customers certainly like that model. And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. A question on the transportation and logistics initiatives. And in particular, if you could share any of the effects or learnings thus far with air cargo. In particular, what kind of performance or cost-efficiencies that you may be realizing or expect to realize from this effort. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Colin. As you point out, we're \u2013 we have expanded our own fleet. We now have 18 planes in service for Amazon, and we have announced rights to lease up to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. So we have great relationships with third party carriers. We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. We're putting it to good use, as I mentioned before, with the sortation center example. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of an investment in capabilities in India at this point and how you think about that market longer term. And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more recently in markets like China and India. And if I could, just finally, you've previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the video product in terms of consumer engagement, and the effects on Prime. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether these metrics are continuing to improve as spending continues to rise on video and consumer awareness is seemingly growing as well. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with your middle question. I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see \u2013 you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. So is there just an accounting housekeeping a way to think about stock-based comp? You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses. And so is there just a way to think about, A, will that be in the queue? Or are you not disclosing it anymore? And is there a way to think about what I guess the patterns would be consistent with historical patterns by segment? Thanks. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Jason. This is Darin. Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to possibly continue. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1. Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to \u2013 it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail \u2013 the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is, would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few \u2013 you feel that scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last year is sort of what you need? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prime Now and what was the other thing? Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC : And the sorting centers. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across eight countries. The Same-Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC : But were you thinking about building out the capacity? It sounds like last year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that \u2013 the value that it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thank you for joining us on our call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results to the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017 only, and include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will open up the call for questions. We ask each caller please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those or in terms of the ones that are the largest areas of investment in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you could update us on that given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So, to give that some perspective, the Amazon-fulfilled network, or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year, and it's continued through this year. Last year we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went into service in the back end of last year. And that's what I mentioned about this time last year. The similar dynamic this year, we are going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year, so that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the video content. Video content last year, I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still \u2013 we lapped that most of the first half this year and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3, and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I will also point out that the strong usage growth in AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in capital leases to build the capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing \u2013 accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. A question on the grocery category and the announcements that we have \u2013 that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they are very customer-centric, just like us. They've built a great business, focus around quality and customer. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about what the place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experimenting with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh. And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think it's a valuable \u2013 all those are valuable services, Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality customer service to this offering. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that business as well. And gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring. I've even said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate. So we are adding \u2013 having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts. On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores and I would say that the benefit there is again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about a third of the people were standing around the device table learning how they work, how they interact with devices. So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. A question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is kind of incremental, is geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2 and if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Let me start with the second one. So, yes, we've had numerous price decreases, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide. So, nothing really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoint. The fulfillment investments, I can't split it out for you between Amazon logistics support sort centers and fulfillment centers. What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying into this year. It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program. We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will. But that's about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy with the FBA program. It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. We know customers really like it, the additional selection that FBA provides. So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices? And then just secondly, on Prime, the value of a Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as you add more features in there. Can you just talk about your view around the flexibility of the price of annual Prime subscription? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On the price of Prime, I have nothing to add at this time. We think that the \u2013 we are increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal in retail. On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption. Again, as I said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2, and also we had the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth. So, you're seeing great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30 databases over the last year-and-a-half. We signed some very big customer wins, like Ancestry, High Tail, California Polytechnic State University and others, that we're very proud to have. So, yes, the momentum in the business is very strong. We continue to open new regions. We'll be opening five regions in the near future in France, China, Sweden, Hong Kong and a second government cloud region in the East. So, yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say that while pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because of our functionality and pace of innovation, the innovation keeps accelerating. It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and features. We also know the customers value our partner and customer ecosystem and really the experience we've had, we've been at this longer than anybody else. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. I want to stick with AWS, please. So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change but the AWS operating margin was lower I guess than we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that. I find that a little surprising but then I also saw that the tech and content came in materially heavy, I think, versus our and I assume other expectations. So could you just talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything that's changed in the profitability of AWS? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, excuse me, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion. And that is showing up in tech and content. On the marketing, if you look under the marketing expenses, they are also up, and that is driven by the increases we're seeing in the sales team both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those two as probably larger than normal impacts on Q2 operating margin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, as you continue to add more Prime Now markets with one to two-hour shipping, can you just talk to some of the logistical challenges that you've already encountered and worked through? And talk to kind of if you really do see one to two-hour shipping become a larger piece of the business over the next year, what's the biggest challenge you have to make sure that you manage? And the second one on the subscription revenue, it looks like subscription revenue growth was strong again, over 50%. Could you just talk to what drove that acceleration? Was it Prime? Or is there something else in there? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with your second question on the subscription revenue. It grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1. So, we continue to see strong Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also \u2013 in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music. Again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year. On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across eight countries. We do learn. It's something to do in every city and have different \u2013 slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go, learn as we grow internationally as well. That is a service that customers love. That's not an inexpensive service, though, and we also have \u2013 so we're constantly working on our cost of delivery and our route densities. And again, we like what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but also a lower-cost operation as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good afternoon, Brian. I think I heard you earlier say that your head count for advertising salespeople is growing faster than the company as a whole, or company's head count growth rate as a whole. I would just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of self-service versus salespeople. And then a second one would just be a quick one. I know it's early, but be curious to see what you're seeing with users of the Echo Show, with the screen on it, and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user behavior there versus the original devices with that one. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes. It's early on the Echo Show. As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. So it's \u2013 I've used mine, it's awesome. It's a big step up in my mind, but we'll get more customer feedback as we go along. On advertising, technically what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular head count and that sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. So, we built self-service tools and obviously we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers and advertisers, but we realize that we will need actual sales contact with the accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get into the split, really, but I would see both growing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two. One, with respect to international margins, is there anything there you can give us in terms of rank order or color, whether it be geographies or category expansion that we should be thinking about that are driving some of the cost curve in the international side of the business? That would be number one. Number two, stock-based comps stepped up a lot, both quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. Wanted to know if there was anything either organic or inorganic that was driving that step-up in stock-based compensation. Thank so much. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with the second one. Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step-up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion. So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a head count increase of 42%. I'll also say that we generally see a step-up from Q1 to Q2 because we do our employee RCU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a normal trend. But the 51% year-over-year is also \u2013 it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that. So that was another influence in Q2. On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the investments we're making in North America we're also making in international. Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and international. The North America segment is a little further along in the Prime, excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve. And so in some respects we are giving benefits earlier in the lifecycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later. And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India and we see great momentum and success there, so we continue to invest and we have some of our best people in that business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. You mentioned before just stand of new fulfillment centers, it takes a bit of time for them to ramp optimization. How should we think about that path optimization over a year or so? As you continue to scale operations and you bring data to bear and robotics and Kivas and AI machine learning, are you finding that kind of new fulfillment center optimization curve is accelerating? Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hi, Brian. This is Darin. Yes. We're getting more efficient every time we put new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just through the experience we've gained over the years. We still say it takes up to three years or three peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network gets sufficient over time. So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from line of from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Just one, other slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53% year-over-year. Anything to call out? And then just you made a comment about physical stores and reaction to one other question that was really about showcasing new devices. Is it fair to say that probably means locations would have small footprints versus large footprints if you're thinking about that? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: I'm sorry. What was the first part of your question? Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: The other, other revenue slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53%. Is there anything to call out around that? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: No, nothing in that other line item. It's advertising and also other things like cobranded credit card agreements. I would say that advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters. So that number will move around, but there's other things in it that more the variance and the volatility is in the other line items. Your question on stores, we are \u2013 again, I personally think the new devices, the ability to see new devices is a great asset, but I don't want to shortchange the rest of the bookstore and the ability to have curated selection and the creativity we've had in taking new look at the bookstores. So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different sizes and we look at revenue cost per square foot just like any other physical retailer. So, we haven't essentially nailed the model yet, and we continue to experiment to see what works and how it differs by city or more suburban locations. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.: So thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website through at least the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.",

For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration, how you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past? Thank you. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure to (03:57) unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that for the three months ended, around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18). That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods. What we're seeing more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece. We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred. So that's, I think, one of a number of factors. So, there's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned, but we have seen that monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So, that's part of what you're seeing. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And your question about Whole Foods, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is, it's shown actually in the new physical stores revenue component, $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing the Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is, the cost of revenue, physical stores revenue is going to be where we're going to book any sales where the customer physically selects an item in a store. So, it will also include, or does include our Amazon Books. But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're really excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. I guess I'll ask two as well. The first one is that was a bit of unusual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. What most surprised you in the quarter? You have been pretty consistent on how you reported versus your guide, so something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happened, what would you attribute that to? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call. But it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime in Prime Day globally, had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. It was also a very strong quarter for AWS. Revenue growth was the same as Q2, and now we're at an $18 billion run rate, whereas last quarter when I had this call, we were at $16 billion, so very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then, briefly, on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets, geographic markets, you would call out there? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I would \u2013 yeah, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq obviously, this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally, and it carried through the quarter, but generally, I would point to the increased selection. A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime benefits, advancements in free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but it was stronger than probably I anticipated. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering could you talk about one or two of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just the strategic opportunities you see of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business. And the second one, on the subscription revenue, you accelerated to 59%. Could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and what I can tell you is I have been in meetings with John Mackey and his team, and they are very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission and expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So, that's kind of the early report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, as you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, audiobooks, e-books, so there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships, and as I said, we had the largest new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction and is an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. In the comment in the release on seasonal workers, that looks roughly flat year-on-year. I wanted to know if you could understand a little bit more about the trajectory around the workers needed to fulfill seasonal holiday demand and what that might also mean for automation or efficiency benefits you're getting inside your fulfillment centers? Thanks so much. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, Eric, this is Dave. I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. So, we're continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than or \u2013 roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations. So, we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have Amazon Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it requires a tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well, and so we'll continue to hire there. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions. Without those, without that head count, the base Amazon grew 47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays. We continued to hire a lot of software engineers. We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was hoping you could help us understand how, at this point, you're prioritizing expansion into new product categories. In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category. Can you just help us understand the approach in general to new categories and pharmacy in particular? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I can't confirm or deny any of the rumors related to pharmacy or anything else. I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So, there will be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents. We have on campus bookstores. So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast headstart on that and a great base. And a great team to work with who has a lot of history and a lot of \u2013 they probably have 10 years to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So, we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. The other category which includes advertising accelerated 58% in the quarter. I think the common view there is that that's a fairly high margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially what impact is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right, other revenue grew 58% in the quarter. And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would say, generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. We'll also provide \u2013 and giving them targeted recommendations, so making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive. And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers. So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products. On the international, yeah, I can't split it, the effects, but I will tell you again, it is international expansion and primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits. And we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members join in India than in any other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million items there and we're continuing to add benefits; Prime Video, Amazon Family. We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India. So, a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India, very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India. So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base. But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers. So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. So, there's a lot of different influences there. You saw the growth rate. We believe that it's resonating with customers. So, we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Two questions. There's been some news flow recently about Brazil expansion. Can you just talk about how Brazil compares to maybe some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia or in India? And then a follow-up on the Whole Foods, so do you feel like the store footprint at 460 odd scores is adequate? Or any color on plans to expand either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon Books stores or those other ones you mentioned? Thank you. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Ross. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and e-books offering without the sort of physical categories and, more recently, added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering. So, I think, we're excited about the electronics getting out there. There is a wide variety of products included in that category : smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So, I think, we're really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, we really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington DC, and Austin. So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce what that will look like and we are working with the Whole Foods team on how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early, so those plans will develop over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Brian. I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now? And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe again knowing you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached that in the past or in other markets. And then to the extent that we're thinking about AWS growth in the fourth quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and, obviously, have about an 800-basis-point easier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those two things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through the end of the year? Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Heath. This is Dave. I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that. And so, I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses multi-user accounts, improving approval workflow tools and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime Shipping, which we think will be a great way for businesses to use multiuser \u2013 business customers have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and Germany. So, I think it's part of that offering, and we will really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we are focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, on AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts timed about around December 1 of last year. That certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re :Invent is in December or the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Scott William Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I had two, please. First, Prime Now, Fresh, Prime Pantry, and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those four as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint. And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with video. And I just want to be clear. We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. And why are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers. It continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon. And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. So we always do that. We're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base, and things they want to see. So that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we remain very bullish on the video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects at the back-end of this year and also lined up into next year. On the, sorry, the second comment was, oh, the overlap. Yes. So Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases combine them. We're not sure how it'll play out. But we're going cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy, just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipments. So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers and we're going to continue to work on those. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I'll actually ask two, if I can. Just any way you can comment on the increase in Whole Foods traffic after the close? And then second, talk about your desire to have an ad supported business on Fire TV or through Prime Video? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start on traffic. So we're not disclosing traffic figures. Whole Foods will be issuing a final 10-K early next month. So you'll see a better perspective on the entire quarter. The quarter that, or the four week period that you see running through the Amazon P&L this quarter is pretty hard to draw conclusions on other than revenue at this point. But Dave, do you have more on the...? Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Jason, this is Dave. On the ad supported question, I think what you've seen to-date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad free. There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's the first free episode, but generally we like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about delivery and just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements and products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just wanted to better understand this investment. Is this a result of, or the thesis that more options could drive obviously more sales on the flip side, do you think you're losing sales by not having those options? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Probably a little of both. We think that especially as we get into more and more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing convenience for them. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's right. In terms of overall investments there. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And the other investments obviously are on the -maybe on the bigger-ish things or like planes and transportation capacity in general. There our philosophy is, again, we are going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays. By investing in those transportation options, we do so at same cost or cost parity I would say at the very minimum. But it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cut off times for customers. It enables Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from what once was 3 PM in the afternoon to midnight. Has huge benefits for both the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales and it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon is going to be there for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football Game will start in two hours and 20 minutes, so... Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: On that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Ross Sandler - Barclays PLC Mark May - Citigroup Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Kenneth Sena - Wells Fargo Securities Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.  With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it? Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company on noteworthy North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were busy. So it's a very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job.  Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, although not in the North America segment. I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say there's the volume -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years, and this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Douglas Anmuth : Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. There things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also, how you think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. I will be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and the growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- actually $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response with continued geographic expansion and continuing to again build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits, we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales with very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner, partners we work with, skills that we've increased rapidly, we're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000 plus smarthome devices from 1,200 unique brands. So that -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets and we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things that I would point to. And that is an area again where we'll continue to invest heavily, and as you say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially the fuel strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled the units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate. We expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call. We do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'd be really -- I'd incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Hey guys, just two questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what are the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, the shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact often greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. There are now over 100 million items in the U.S. So shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth -- usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate, and customers continued to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost error -- excuse me, price decrease last year, but we're very happy with the performance in the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Mark May : Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidance is typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in the recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15, previously. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of the cost remain from the year-over-year build up in cost, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's -- given the 30% plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's 1 major headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. That's probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say. Dave Fildes : This is Dave. Just on the second piece on pricing. I think on the pricing environment, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS, I mean periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business where reduced prices more than 60x with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers, and some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and future launches, better options for customer that -- customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Daniel Salmon : First, Brian, any comments on the impact of ASC 606 accounting changes on your first quarter guidance here? And then just second on the advertising business, in particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, you have line search product sponsored ads, do you aim for certain particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring it based on users activity, maybe a combination of both? I would just be interested in your thoughts on that. Dave Fildes : Yes, this is Dave. I'll take the first part of that question just around the new revenue recognition standard. We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up. There are -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue in terms of any aggregate, the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter. It's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted us. But again, not material in the aggregate. Brian Olsavsky : And on advertising, I would say our strategy is to make the customer experience additive by the ad process. We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. So we're working with advertisers of all types and sizes to help them reach our customer base and the goal of driving brand awareness, discovery and better purchase decisions by the customer. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : I think I have two questions. First, your Whole Foods, you've got over a quarter under your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, your international decelerated a little bit this quarter, just wondering if there was any country to call out or anything going on there? And we know that you spent about $3 billion on International investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high watermark is on that? So just maybe a little more color on your international about business. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together. In our physical stores, it feels there are supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year. We've also added Lockers, and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortization over the useful life, and a lot of that is forward frontloaded, so we'll see higher amortization in the first few years, and then it reverse later. So excluding this noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales. Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers. In India, India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year than we've seen in any other country in the history of the world, our world. So the selection is also increasing Prime eligible selection is up over 25 million items, launching Video there and also continuing to add other Prime benefits such as Prime Music will be coming soon, Amazon Family is there, as I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a little bit on international growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. First one, in the press release, you talked about the strength of the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the -- what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick up in consumer spending as they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one , Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business. I'd be curious to hear about your investment needed to go into logistics, health care and kind of new areas you haven't really cracked into as hard yet. Dave Fildes : Yes, this is Dave, thanks for the answer the question, Brian. Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups from memberships at a strong clip. When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in. We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program. And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I've said logistics, we will continue to build our logistics capability both -- and that will be all the way to end delivery. We've been able to increase service levels in many cases by delivering ourselves. And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well. I would say on the category side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base. And to a lesser extent, versus grocery, I would say we continue to build our business, B2B businesses, and very happy with the initial performance there with a number of the companies and universities that we've been working with and their initial results. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys, so I wanted to go back to, and I think you said one of the biggest focuses of the year is going to be on the consumables now, Fresh, Whole Foods. There's been a lot of press on the Whole Foods front, the out-of-stock issue and then clearly, in the Now, as we've been testing it, the Fresh has the same issue. So I was wondering if you guys could talk about what the company plans to do. I mean, there is obviously the reputational risk that could come from that to kind of correct some of these issues and kind of what the view of the company is on the out-of-stock issues. Not just the Whole Foods but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. We've made no changes post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the out-of-stock issue is that -- may be getting press or tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues. But stepping beyond any short-term issues, the commitment is -- remains to have healthy, high-quality selection in stock for products. That's what the Whole Foods team is committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issues, they'll be corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. But it be something we're working on. So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Youssef Squali : We've seen that the number of private label products on the site has increased pretty dramatically over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you speak to your private label strategy, in general? How big is that segment today? How big can it become? And just broadly speaking, how are the margins in that segment versus comparable third-party products? Dave Fildes : Yes, thanks for the question. This is Dave. I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection, and we look for ways to be able to find private label items that have a high-caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing the customers in many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across categories that would offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years, in some cases. Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands and some of the more popular lines with customers things like Good Threads, Amazon's Essentials, which is men's and women's basics; consumables, is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and [indiscernible] Prime and others. So I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. And certainly there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll keep adding selection. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo. Kenneth Sena : Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that behind keeping AWS and Retail under 1 corporate structure, and does it make sense given the scale of where AWS is right now? And then -- and I'm sorry if I have a little bit of an echo, I don't know why, but -- and we're hearing from marketers just how important Amazon is to their media strategy, so I don't know if you could just maybe talk about that a little bit more broadly in terms of the approach in your philosophy to that business. Dave Fildes : Sure, we see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key component, as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is, the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we, as depending on the position in the company, on the consumer side, the use of AWS is -- has driven great infrastructure efficiencies just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed costs into variable costs and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as an internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, and sorry, Ken, your second question was? Kenneth Sena : Yes, the second question was just on the advertising side. And we're just hearing so much more how important Amazon is to broader media budgets. And so just hoping to get maybe a little bit more color just on your approach to the business right now, some of the drivers behind the recent success and just maybe just more of a sort of, as you look out over the next few years, kind of how important do you see this business becoming in the grand scheme of things? Dave Fildes : Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us, and offer them a great experience on the website and ability to be able to reach customers. So I think there's more to come on that side. As we said, we're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenues as part of the other revenue line item. And I think we're going to keep building more and new tools based on what we're learning from our customers there to better serve in the future. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, I think we're also point of a key lien in from brands and agencies into the e-commerce marketing space. So it's other side, search or social marketing, it's really helping them engage customers on a high, efficient, highly efficient manner. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.",

Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Our first question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much for taking the question. Wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business, sort of the state of conversations with advertisers? What product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of 2017 and into 2018 broadly for the platform? Thanks so much. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yes, sure, Eric. I would say advertising continues to be a bright spot both from a product standpoint and also financially. It continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the \u2013 in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So our philosophy there again is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase. Before I go into the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and One-Day options. And our Two-Day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119 for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price of Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And, Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, just wanted to remind folks that we mentioned this last quarter on the call. But on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of costs of sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is \u2013 the other revenue is, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex-FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. Again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is \u2013 would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line item, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex-FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex-FX year-over-year. Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognized this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities, what can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S. and hopefully, New York soon? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So, we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So, the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime \u2013 those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense, the accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer, you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So first, with the \u2013 you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure. But the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime flywheel. So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So, not much more I can add by product line to North America. And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're \u2013 we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last two quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing customers and signing new customers for \u2013 see increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workflows to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as Aurora continues to grow at a very rapid clip. So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem that others don't. And we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citi Investment Research : Thank you. Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, the rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, that rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment, then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now. And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue? Thanks. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised \u2013 or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%. But again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: And on the question on capacity, \u2013 excuse me, cap \u2013 I'll address it as CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses. So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we get into bigger and bigger products. That's a representative number for that period. On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months. So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So have a couple things at play there that hopefully keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you had significant operating income upside in 1Q and I think a better outlook for the second quarter than many expected. Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta relative to your 1Q guide? And is there any reason to think that you couldn't see similar leverage in the back half of the year? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top-line growth was \u2013 continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend that we've seen recently. So customer adoption in AWS remained strong. And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on \u2013 with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially. We \u2013 at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high \u2013 relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilization. So we're still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due to the high sales without having additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see the reconfigure inventory locations. So that also helped and probably differential versus the guidance estimate. And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers. We'll have some costs in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So \u2013 and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Two questions. The $239 million in other income, what was that? And then could you just wax a little bit eloquently hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what are \u2013 what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high profit, high margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute the consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that. And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow \u2013 that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me wax eloquently. Try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with. We have transportation companies that we partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of these companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with \u2013 on investments. It's also \u2013 there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive. On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So we show the sponsored products, we're trying to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said. We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then we want to let sellers for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are of all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully purchase. So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. But you're right, there are always pressures in that. We will come down on the side of the customer. On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do that right now. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL. We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or Nothing; the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. So that was one of our first forays in the live format that \u2013 one of the first forays in the live format where we had live ads and kind of, we're not only learning the technology, but learning to \u2013 learning that business. And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping rollout, so I think this was recently announced. Where do you think you measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from those regions where you don't really have an official site for people come in to buy stuff from you anyway. So, which regions or countries are accounting for most of the demand that you are seeing? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Stephen, are you're still on? Can you elaborate more on the countries you're talking about, specifically? Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe. So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Oh, on global store? Okay. Yes. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries. So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in \u2013 who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Yeah, thank you. I'd like to maybe dive into a couple of local recent overhangs. First, on shipping partners, just wondering how dependent are you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries that you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could talk a little bit about dependency there? And then secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states? And just kind of overview of your view on collecting third-party sales \u2013 taxes from third parties in other states if that were to pass? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are. But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of our expansion of Amazon Logistics. It's driven the creation of sort centers. It's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network. So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics capability. It's well over 50% in some countries, particularly the UK. It helps with again Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, which again we mentioned the Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and Justin, this is Dave, just on the sales tax piece. Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. On the 3T piece, we do collect on behalf of our sellers in two states, Washington State as of the first of this year, and then Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1. So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So yeah, nothing really more to add on that. I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Thanks. So I want to follow up on Prime a little bit. The fee increase, why now? I mean, we've been adding value for a long time, obviously shipping costs are going up. Why is now the right time to have that fee hike, especially since membership looks like the growth numbers are starting to slow? And tied into that, there's a lot of Alexa mentioning in the release. Could you give us some uptake on the importance of Alexa and basically voice commerce, and so the metrics you get in terms of usage there and the flywheel? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. We always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer. As I mentioned earlier, creation \u2013 or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera. So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering. I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days. Today you could get over 100 million products within two days, and many, many, many products within one day, same day or two hours. So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from... Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sorry go ahead. Operator : Sorry go ahead. Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. So the U.S. international revenue mix, ex-Whole Foods and ex-AWS looks about 64%, 36%. Given investments in the international markets would you envision international kind of closing the gap in the coming years? And what would be the key drivers of the mix shift getting closer to 50-50? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is the international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America. So when we add benefits, Prime benefits, we're probably adding them at an earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than we did in the U.S. So, they have different dynamics. We think at the end of the day customers behave the same globally and that they value low prices selection and great customer experience. So, we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll continue to expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases selection even more and builds great partnerships with sellers. We'll continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices. And sorry, I cut out the last person [Technical Difficulty] (30:50-30:55) including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with, in the home and I think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access over time Amazon products better. We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. The Prime program started in the first year in India grew faster than any Prime program we've seen in other countries. We're adding local content in India, video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime benefits. We're rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa is up, as you saw in the press release, to 40,000 [Technical Difficulty] (31:46-31:51). Yes, but it's \u2013 it is important to us that they all are still delighting customers and growing to the best of their ability. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thanks Brian. And thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead? Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. I guess, the standout metric of the quarter was the profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and International have improved year-over-year. Could you talk about (03:04) was it better than your expectations for the quarter? And then maybe reasons for the ad business to accelerate within the other line? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, yeah. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had \u2013 what I attribute it to is continued strength in our \u2013 some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs, and generally all of our fixed costs. You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate. So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a same rapid clip year-over-year. Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries, Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued \u2013 it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Hey, maybe two things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth, I think, it was 17%, any particular things to call out there as that would have stunted that growth or negatively limited? Or is that just kind of the new, new normal? And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit more, and a little more color particularly on the retail side of the business? Are there particular newfound efficiencies that are sustainable? Thanks a lot. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let's start with unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2, with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were number of factors. I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25. So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just \u2013 the units do not count in this unit calculation. So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by again Prime, the Prime program, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection, and particularly third-party selection. On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and capital costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown \u2013 we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis. But 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing head count. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech head count. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people. So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed head count that may be made that less pronounced. But this year it's a little more apparent. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask two, if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build out period ahead of the holidays, and then lower utilization, but obviously your profit outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build out and square footage increases this year? And then, secondly a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition, and how that helps advance your efforts, and how we should think about integration going forward? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you, today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into holiday, but if you think back, the last two years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth, both in 2016 and 2017. We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years, but I don't have a number for you today. I will say that, the majority of it is being put in service in the back-end of the year, just like in the last two years. But I'll \u2013 we'll clarify that next quarter. On PillPack, yes, the deal of course hasn't closed, yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that, working together with them we can expand on that in the future. They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly-differentiated customer experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting retail business? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. Again, the business has accelerated the last three quarters, and we're seeing great signs in a number of areas. We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database Migration Service. And customers are just branching out to a lot of new products from us. There are new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, serverless computing and database and analytics are really big. So we think that, when you look at it, why do people come to us? It's essentially set functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated for multiple years. We've built a very strong partner and customer ecosystem. And frankly we've the most proven reliability of security and performance, and we've been at this longer than anyone else. So again, we continue to deliver for customers. We continue to use feedback from customers to develop new services and features. The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, a very strong performance this quarter. Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year-over-year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And I think, the second question was just related to how is Alexa impacting the business, overall. And \u2013 hey, this is Dave. I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those. We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there. So I think, that's a lot of \u2013 the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Just on the AWS point, as you're seeing customers to AWS, you're adding new customers to AWS, can you give us a sense of sort of where you're seeing customers spend focus. How successful \u2013 you mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow? And then, you flagged the flat capital lease growth on a year-over-year basis. In the past when you've talked about the growth in CapEx and capital lease, you generally referred to trying to grow those numbers or that infrastructure growth overall more or less with the business. Is there some level of efficiency breakthrough that you've gotten there where that's no longer the case? Or is it a function of timing? How should we think about what that CapEx and capital lease spend signals about your expectations for growth? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we \u2013 we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but the rate of growth over last year is flat. So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. We do spend a lot of time driving better efficiency in our data centers. We do see it; sometimes it is higher than other quarters. The starting point for our expectation would be, the usage growth would be very \u2013 that our growth in infrastructure costs would start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue growth rate. But we can drive more efficiently and we can sometimes bank the efficiencies of prior investments that we've made in other periods. So it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I would say last year in the first half was a pretty large investment area. I'll lump it in with capital expenditures, but in the first two quarters, Q1 of last year, it was 82% growth year-over-year in capital expenditures, Q2 was 67%. This year, those numbers are 33% in Q1, and 1% in Q2. So it's a \u2013 there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks. I don't have on the other piece, on product detail, I don't have anything more for you. I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone \u2013 a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. I'd count Amazon in that category, because on the consumer side of the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the conversion to AWS resources. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one on the ad business, Brian, I was just wondering, could you give us some examples of some products you've had particular success with on the ad side? And I know you guys are always focused on removing customer friction points and solving pain points for customers, maybe talk to us about some of the still existing pain points for your advertiser customers you're looking to address with the advertising product? And the second one, I know it's an accounting question, but we're going to be asked it a lot. On revenue accounting, can you just sort of walk us through any of the accounting changes that any of the revenue lines had in the current quarter because of the multiple accounting moving pieces? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll start with advertising. So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us. We're seeing strong adoption across a number of fronts. Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. So we have hundreds of thousands of emerging and established advertisers. And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to \u2013 whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site. Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers. Automating, we're doing a lot of work on automating the activities that the advertisers need to do, and continue to invent new products for those advertisers. We also think measurement is going to be important so we're focused on our measurement capabilities, so advertisers understand what outcomes they're driving on our properties. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And Brian, this is Dave. Just on the accounting piece, specifically to Q2, the impact of the Accounting Standards Update, revenue recognition changes we did starting in the first part of year, it's a $640 million increase to other revenue, specifically related to how we treat some of the advertising service. So you remember as part of the adoption beginning in 2018, certainly the advertising services were classified as revenue rather than cost of sales. So $640 million more is in other revenue this second quarter. You'd see that in that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter. In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue. So that year-over-year growth rate for that line item would have been higher, but for that change. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much. Two questions if I can. On Whole Foods, any update on the integration of Whole Foods within the broader Prime ecosystem, the way in which you're tying those assets and customer bases together to sort of promote the flywheel that you've talked about a fair bit? And Prime Now, any update on the scale of markets globally, and what you're learning as Prime Now continues to scale in terms of how users adopt the service, putting SKUs closer to prem what that does to the velocity of purchasing? Thank you so much. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. So, it was a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime. We launched additional savings for Prime members at Whole Foods. If you go to Whole Foods store or Whole Foods Market 365 store, you see a lot of yellow stickers for 10% discounts of hundreds of sale items. You also see deep discounts on selected popular products. So Prime members have adopted this benefit, it's one of the fastest rates we've ever seen for a Prime benefit, and they've already saved millions of dollars on everything from seasonal favorites to as I said popular daily sales. So in addition, we've expanded grocery delivery to 20 cities so that's picking up steam. During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals for Prime customers at Whole Foods. Actually, the deals lasted for a week at Whole Foods. And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods. And the Prime Rewards Visa Card, which gives you 5% off on all purchases has been applied to Whole Foods' purchases as well. So that is the second wave, probably after the first wave where we talked in previous calls about initial price drops, putting lockers in the stores, selling some of the Whole Foods' products on the Amazon site, and other things. So the invention level is still really high. We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops. Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's across 9 countries. It is different than \u2013 we have multiple options for you in grocery delivery. We have the delivery services \u2013 so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need. We have a traditional grocery store now with Whole Foods, and then we have the combination of those two with home delivery, and we're using Prime Now or Whole Foods products through Prime Now to make those deliveries as well as the new kind of stores with Amazon Go that we're experimenting with. So lots of innovation, invention on that front as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good evening. Hey guys, I had two questions. First is on the Music business. So I think, you said recently you had tens of millions of paying subscribers. So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime, and using the mobile app, or they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that uptake and converting users into paid members? Then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the improvement in retail operating margin. If we look at International, it's still negative, but it's also improving pretty meaningfully, so can you parse where that improvement's coming from between India and the other emerging markets versus some of the more mature markets in Western Europe? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure, let me start with that second question. So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient. I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it is in North America. But you're right. We continue to invest. We're investing in India obviously, and have seen good traction there. We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary \u2013 celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue. But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prime in Australia; we're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime benefits in the newer geographies. So that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin. But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. We also like that the \u2013 on Prime Day, we were able to expand our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. So we're very bullish on our International business. We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in different stages of growth in different countries. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Dave. Just quickly on Music, as you mentioned, tens of millions of paid customers are enjoying Amazon Music. When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things. Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill. One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music. So that's proven to be a, I think, a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy in addition to a really kind of rich and growing Amazon skill set. We now have more than 45,000 skills available to customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much. On the new Supreme Court decision, you guys have been collecting state taxes in all 45 states where it's applicable for a 1P. And for a 3P, I think, it was in two states. Have you seen any slowdown to growth in these two states since you began collecting taxes? I think, you started maybe last 12 months or so. When will you start collecting taxes in the rest of the country, and will you charge for it? Because my understanding is that, in those two states you do not collect or you do not charge to help these 3P sellers file taxes or collect state taxes. Thank you. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Youssef this is Dave. So right now, as you mentioned 45 states that have state-imposed sales tax, first-party products we do our own collection on that. For 3P sellers right now, it's three states. So Washington State started as of January 1, Pennsylvania as of April 1, and most recently Oklahoma on July 1. So those are the ones where we're collecting and remitting. We haven't said \u2013 and to your second point we've not talked about any kind of trends. As you could imagine some of these are still really early days. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Given the focus in the press release about Alexa Voice Services, any thoughts about how you would monetize on third-party devices? And then just a follow up on Amazon Prime Video Channels, any plans to offer standard skinny bundles to become a cable replacement? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, let me start with Alexa. So right now, our emphasis is around expanding the reach of Alexa and the usefulness. So as Dave mentioned, we're now up over 45,000 skills. We have a developer network of \u2013 that's expanded and we have over 13,000 smart home devices from 2,500 unique brands. You're seeing things like expansion into the hotel space where we're partnering with hotels to allow you to experience Alexa while you're traveling. And you saw from the quote that was in our press release from Jeff, the number of Alexa-enabled devices has tripled in the past year, so \u2013 including some really large companies like Polk, Sonos, Acer, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, BMW, Ford, Toyota to name a few. So that's the biggest emphasis, is getting the expansion of Alexa to places where it can be useful. We also are developing new machine learning tools to help developers more easily build Alexa skills. We feel like we're getting great traction there. So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as useful as possible, and make devices that can use the skills. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and then just on the second question. I mean, I can't speculate on what we might do in the future, but I'd say today, with Prime Channels, I think, we're really pleased with the growth we're seeing. We've seen some good channels come online over the last few quarters, and seen some good traction there. So we'll keep focusing on building out even better selection, because it's clear to us that customers want that option to be able to add that content as part of their Prime memberships. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that. I know it's a tough 3Q comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years? What categories? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Thank you, Justin. Yeah, let me just remind you a couple of things from last year. We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited in particular. It's been really popular. I'll just remind you that the units \u2013 those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So, yeah, I would say essentially with that backdrop, we're still very, very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers on the consumer side. We have Amazon fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units. In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime eligible items that are available for FREE Two-Day Shipping for Prime members. And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: And, Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on to that. You mentioned the online stores. Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex-FX, to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business. That seemed to slow down, I guess that whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would have led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there? Thanks a lot. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. On a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at two things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May. So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple factors that hit the international growth area in particularly. But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. Story is different country-by-country obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So, great first wave of the, what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which lead into Diwali. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Can you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of outperformance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And then any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with Q3 and this will be commentary pretty much on the whole year that was especially true in Q4. So, first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out. So, first on head count. If you'll remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%, but without Whole Foods we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles. So we're only up 13% on head count through nine months year-over-year. So a real step down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one, which is really significant, is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business, they're also for our Amazon consumer businesses, who is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year. So those three areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Question on AWS. Obviously in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%, still quite strong, but dollar and percentage growth did slow. I'm just kind of curious are you just reaching a point in terms of a lot of large numbers where it will be more difficult to sustain not only accelerating growth, but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something also going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for your question. This growth rate is going to bounce around. We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still 46% growth is very strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was about $18 billion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. And we just mentioned on the cost side, it's been a very good year from gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructure costs. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the fourth quarter revenue guide and the fourth quarter revenue deceleration. Maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year? And which of those are really slowing down sort of driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to? Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around Kiva. Curious for your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in autonomous driving technologies to think about some of the other retailers partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80-basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last year. So if you, even factoring that, and we're looking at Q4 and we have very high error bars on the quarter. Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we're going to have great capacity not only for retail products but also for FBA. We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for Prime members. So we're very bullish on the fourth quarter. And we'll just have to see how revenue comes in. I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that you should be aware of and may remember from prior quarters. This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method. Previously, we had done it on a, is tilted more to Q4. It's based more on shipping units. So what you've seen is a push of revenue and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentioned on each call. This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is to scale it for you. Under the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter. That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider. On the Robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program. We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density of product storage and a number of other benefits. It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omni-channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households. How should we be thinking about that push in 2019 and 2020 and how that might open up new areas of wallet share for the company? Thanks guys. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I think we've started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods side. You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities in the U.S., giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods. We've also expanded grocery pickup and that's available in 10 cities. So the customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've started to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can build your cart using Alexa and then check out using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, as you say, omni-channel overlap, especially in the grocery business. On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats. Amazon Go is now up to six stores. We opened five in the quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. We opened up a Amazon four-star location in New York City where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon. We of course have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I guess two questions. Any color on, it looks like shipping costs and maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some of that pressure? And then, the 15% fulfillment square-footage growth, you're obviously deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the current generation of fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how should we think about a 15%? Is that not a good reading indicator on growth into 2019? Or is it \u2013 any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Sure. I think it's comparable to \u2013 last question first. I think the 15% is comparable to the 30%-plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are debating whether the dynamics of the warehouse are changing so that square footage may not be the main indicator, might be cubic feet, but if we switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on the difference between the two. But the other comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence and we negotiate hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our own shipping method. So, we don't see that as being a huge issue. On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase. So that is factored \u2013 I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously factored into guidance into 2019. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed. Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, can you quantify the contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us understand the strategy there. And then there is some news, reports suggesting that you guys were working on an ad supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. Can you just help shed any more light on that, is that especially relative to your Prime Video offering? Thank you very much. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September. So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are. And right now our focus is on learning from them and innovating with them on how best to meet customer needs over time. I'll let Dave handle the second question. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. I think, I mean, we have no plans to build an ad-supported Prime Video offering for free at this time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Two questions. First, I think I may have missed earlier. You gave out the impact of ASC 606. And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is now much more important and just the way you kind of capture the value you provide. So maybe if you can \u2013 is there a way to just kind of help us kind of foot the perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's obviously you extracting kind of more value for your partners and customers and for yourself? Thanks. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line. So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change. The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth and we're now \u2013 up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third-party. It's steadily been going up. It's up 300 basis points year-over-year. So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. I think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarter-over-quarter is the gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks very much. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on advertising and the growth opportunity there. If you can help us on the potential for higher ad pricing in terms of the ROI for your marketers hopefully being reflected in higher price per ad. And then what about the ad load? So are we kind of close to being at a full ad load? Is there a long runway there? Just trying to get a sense for pricing and volume underneath advertising. And then also along the lines of advertising, heading into the holiday season, should we expect any increase in your efforts around Alexa commercialization, voice keyword ads let's say, and does that fit into your broader advertising growth strategy? Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, let me talk a little bit more broadly about advertising. So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of and bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we're continuing to invent both on the product side, the tools side with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard, and invent new products for advertisers. If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. So I know it doesn't answer the question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Dave. Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or two in terms of new announcements in devices out there. And I mean really looking at that, the goal is to make customers' lives easier and make it more convenient and a lot of that is you're seeing that in the homes and to some extent on the Go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you're seeing a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers. Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter. It's getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable and introducing a lot of really new cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Wanted to just follow up on the advertising side and get a sense for how much you guys feel like you're demand constrained versus supply constrained, either in the ability to put more ads on your property and/or just provide the tools to advertisers and do you feel like there's more demand than you can satisfy? Any color you can share there? Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: Hey, this is Dave. I mean nothing specific. I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those. And so we spent a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful and customers making those purchase decisions. And so, we're always testing different levels of that and trying to understand, and the various features, whether it's display or some of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback is out there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. I guess two quick ones. Any change in the trajectory of Prime membership growth since the June price increase? And then, how would you describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still a key lever that you use for business development? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase. Of course, that went into effect earlier the year in May. We're very pleased with the renewal data and annual sign up data that we've seen. Since then, program remains very strong, both in membership and engagement, and a lot of our video content, music and shipping definitely as well as other Prime Benefits. We just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S., but in other countries. So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well. I mentioned earlier the linkage with Prime member savings at Whole Foods market that we set up in Q2, the expansion of grocery delivery to more than 60 cities in the U.S. using Prime Now and Whole Foods stores, the ability to pick up groceries from Whole Foods. Adding content, we have a great slate of content coming out in the fourth quarter here. Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs and pretty soon you'll see the follow-up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and also a couple other things, and hopefully you'll see Thursday Night Football tonight when you get home. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: This is Dave. Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean, just a reminder. When we look at this, our pricing philosophy has worked relentlessly, take cost out of our own cost structure and where we can pass savings on to the web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford the lower prices and that's something we work very hard in all our businesses, including AWS to do that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices 67 times since we launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those pre-OC price reductions are a normal part of our business for us. Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.: (30:42) call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter, just, how do you feel about the overall unit growth here, given that the growth was higher last year in the 20s and do you think there are some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward? And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Take the subscription first. Dave Fildes : Yeah. Hey, Justin, this is Dave. Just on the second question on the subscription services, we\u2019d said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018. We\u2019d said we'd anticipated about 300 million lower sort of headwind to subscription services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that, we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX. So the 300 million is certainly part of that decelerate -- the sequential deceleration in the growth rate in that line item. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the -- some of our fastest growing areas, the things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. So we don't focus as much on the number and we direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter.  We think it was a, Q4 in particular was a great quarter for customers that retail, there is a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses, the teams here had done a great job, planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers. We had a great Reinvent Conference in the quarter. So we feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue and income. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business? Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue, just qualitatively or quantitatively, how that's doing? And third, if I could, you spent a lot on marketing in the quarter, it's a real step up. Do you just want to talk about the ROI that you think you're getting on that marketing spend? Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Mark. The first question is on India. Let me start with that. So we have incorporated into our guidance estimate, the best estimate we have for Q1 in India, however, there is much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government rule change is going to have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, we will, but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. Dave, why don\u2019t you talk about the advertising growth? Dave Fildes : Yeah, yeah. I think I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to help that customer set agencies, advertisers, make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so is expanded sponsor brands, placements, some rolled out new campaign reports, so improved campaign manager features. So a number of -- there's a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with the ad tools and the ad services that we offer and we're continually excited about the opportunity there. Brian Olsavsky : And then on your question of marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. This category also includes AWS sales and marketing and keep that in mind, because that's where a lot of our headcount investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing. So variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on India, just bigger picture, Brian, do the new policies change your view at all of the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India and how do you think about your investment strategy there in the near term? And then also just hoping you could talk about some of the impact in the US and UK from free shipping during the fourth quarter holidays? Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Really, we're still evaluating the situation in India. We feel very good about the long term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to be -- need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences. And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection and better convenience for the Indian customer. So it's not all we can say on that topic right now. Dave Fildes : Yeah. And I think Doug, your second point was just around shipping, some of the shipping offers in the holiday. We did lower the free shipping threshold ahead in to the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of that and that was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little bit about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party side, but also sellers continuing to do well. As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of record breaking number of Alexa devices as well and I think just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members, we had the most ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased with that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Mark May : Thank you. When I try to back out the impact factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth for the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to have been, in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin expansion in the retail segment. Can you discuss what may have driven that and how to think about retail gross margins going forward? And then somewhat separately, retail margins last year benefited from several factors, including more modest hiring and more modest growth in fulfillment center capacity, do you see these factors persisting this year? Thanks. Dave Fildes : Yeah. Thank you. Let me start with that last part, because I think if we step back and put 2018 in perspective, there are some clear trends regarding our cost structure. Starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and shipping by greater than 30%. In 2018, that number grew by 15%. Certainly, unit demand was lower, but AFN or Amazon Fulfilled demand were, we\u2019ve combined FBA and retail, remained strong. So we had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years. Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% I believe. Last year, we were at 14% growth. And so, there was a lot of leverage and a lot of, in a way, there was a lot of pre hiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018, while we still continue, in some areas, especially things like our core retail business and also G&A functions, but then we continue to invest again in the technology tied to AWS sales team to an AWS device area. So their groups are growing considerably higher than that 14%, but on total, the company grew 14%.  And then on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital lease slide as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS business to support infrastructure and global expansion, that number grew 10% last year, when it had grown 69% in 2017. So in a lot of ways, 2018 was about banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses, infrastructure that we had put in place in 2016 and \u201917. So while we'll continue to concurrently drive growth and customer offering and Prime benefits, we certainly do take costs seriously and we will continue to work on operational efficiencies. I would expect these investments to increase relative to 2018 and we've reflected what we see so far in Q1 in our guidance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great. Thank you. A little bit -- to dig a little bit deeper into the CapEx capital lease side of things, you guys have said in the past that generally you work to build in line with your expectations for guidance, so that you are trying not to over build or under build when thinking about your fulfilment in data center capacity. We saw that investment re-accelerate in the fourth quarter, after hitting the lows that you referenced in Q3. Anything to read into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first three quarters of last year. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. I see total CapEx that was -- grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, negative 1% in Q3 and then positive 17% in Q4, just the quarter itself. So there was, as you say, a bit of investment in Q4 relative to Q2 and Q3. I still think the 17% is a low number for us, when you talk about the -- supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with AWS and also with our core consumer business. So I am not prepared to give you the forecast for the year right now. I would say that, I would consider 2018 to be a lighter investment year and the lighter year for adding fixed headcount certainly compared to 2016 and 2017 we'll reveal that as we go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what we expect in the first three months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just -- the first one is to go back to the fourth quarter gross margins. I think if we try to back out AWS, it looks like there was a little more gross margin pressure. Can you just talk to any of the puts and takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the fourth quarter and then that other line that I think includes the advertising business, can you just help us, any help at all on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of the accounting changes in the quarter? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Sure. I\u2019m sorry I skipped over that gross margin question earlier, but yeah, gross margins were well up 180 basis points year-over-year, were not up as much as prior quarters. I would say the positive tailwinds still remain, AWS has strong growth of 46% on an FX neutral basis. Third party units continue to grow, advertising dollars continue to grow very well. Some of the headwinds, I would say, were outbound shipping cost, including the free shipping that we did, but mostly, it was the higher Amazon fulfilled units and the greater use of Amazon logistics. And I would also say retail was very strong.  We had a, as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest selling unit globally, so devices had very strong sales in the quarter. We discussed how we don't price devices to make money. We usually will expand our content, expanding our device and usage. There are a group of customers who use our devices and then we monetize that in different ways to commitment to Amazon and the video and everything else. So a bit of it was mix, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more because of the revenue treatment was stronger in Q4. Dave Fildes : Yeah. And just on the other revenue piece, Brian, just to get back to the accounting side. We did adopt that revenue recognition standard in 2018 as I mentioned. As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. So specific to Q4, the impact of that change was an increase of approximately $1 billion to other revenue, so you will see that in the other revenue in total. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Sebastian : Thanks. I guess two for me as well. In the quarter, looking backwards, not considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth accelerated, so I was curious any particular regions or product categories to call out, especially given some of the weakness in the UK? And then marketplace fees are changing in several categories, including Home Furnishings, health and beauty, curious what the strategy is there, I assume to expand selection, but is it also an indication of an increasing focus on those retail categories? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with your second question. Obviously, third party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there. They\u2019ve had great success on our site, the -- more than half of our units sold are from third party sellers. So it's very important to us that we have the right business profile, both for Amazon and for the sellers. So we will always be evolving that, part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes, adding new fees or subtracting old ones, part of it involves raising or lowering fees that sellers pay. So you're going to see this continually from us. We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party. On the international, on an FX neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 19% in Q4. But last call, if you remember, I talked about the timing of Diwali and the impact that had on our growth rates. If we adjust for that and again Diwali had, took place primarily in Q4 this year and it was split between Q3 and Q4 last year. If we adjust for that, international growth is pretty flat Q3 to Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two if I can. First, just on the advertising side, we hear a lot of positive feedback from customers, but also we hear suggestions of their supply constraints. So, how do you guys see inventory growth versus pricing growth as a driver in that business and are there things you can do to grow inventory? And then secondly, there have been some reports, your Amazon shipping effort is kind of expanding beyond some test markets. So wondering if you can give us a sense for what you've seen in this test markets and how you think about expanding your shipping efforts on that productized basis going forward? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Lloyd, thanks for the questions. I'll take the advertising piece first. I mean, I think as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools. I mean, our priorities in the space, that's certainly one of them looking for ways to make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of brands, automating activities, incenting new products and I think in all those regards in those priorities, we think there's some good growth to continue to come both in advertising for on our own properties, but also potentially beyond, over the longer term, so, but even as we look for advertising opportunities on places like Amazon.com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of experimentation. I think we're learning and are a very data interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be able to develop better toolkits for them, understand what types of metrics they want to make them more successful based on what they're telling us. Dave Fildes : Yeah. And on transportation, I assume you're just talking about our expansion of Amazon deliveries and Amazon logistics. Again, we have great partners in place for our business and support globally, what we do is add capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak. So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs. So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One on the media side, has there been any step-up in terms of investments around media content to support your ambition with respect to Prime and the video. It's been a couple of years now since we got an update on rate of spend or how it might impact either historical periods or going forward periods, that would be number one. And then number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the advertising front, how do you think about the video opportunity, you're moving beyond just branded opportunities or sponsored products search on your own properties and thinking about experimenting with over the top video or connected TV opportunities [indiscernible] going forward. Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Let me start with video. We're not quantifying the Prime video spend today, but we do \u2013 it has been increasing. We expect it to increase even further in 2019. We're seeing a lot of again continued strong adoption and the usage and viewing and hours watched of our -- both our music and our seasoned video and music. And as a step back, it builds stronger Prime connectivity with our Prime members, at least, the higher membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. And as we like, we see -- we continue to see that engagement growing. I would say that we've had some particular success in -- recently with 10 Golden Globe nominations and 3 Oscar nominations and Jack Ryan homecoming in season two of the [indiscernible] in particular, were very well received during the quarter. Dave Fildes : Yeah. And then on your second question, just around advertising opportunities and around video, you may have seen it not that long ago, IMDB or Internet Movie Database, one of our subsidiaries, launched FreeDive, which is an ad supported free streaming video channel that's available in the US and it enables customers to watch TV shows and movies without purchasing a subscription. So ad supported, so that's available on the IMDB website with your laptop or personal computer on. I think it's definitely on the Fire TV devices as well is a great way to consume content.  So I think excited about that, other opportunities we've been working with in ads, video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports offering, some of the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night Football, really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning from that and looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and serve with customers with those types of video offers, but also take some opportunity to monetize with the advertising. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Just two, so just can you comment, did advertising slow down relative to third quarter. One, you kind of adjusting for 606 and then secondly, was there any reallocation in segments between online and physical stores and if not any commentary why physical stores was down year-over-year? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Thanks, Jason for your questions. Let me start with the physical stores revenues. So physical stores decreased 3% year-over-year and this is primarily Whole Foods, but also includes our other stores, the Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, Amazon 4 star. What happened in the quarter was we were lapping a period last year when we \u2013 we had purchased Whole Foods in Q3, as you remember of 2017. In Q4, we adjusted their fiscal calendar to link it up with Amazon's and it added about 5 days of revenue into Q4 of last year. So we're comping that year-over-year. The second piece is that, the -- as you said, the online orders where people go to the Prime Now app and then order for delivery or pick up at Whole Foods stores does count or is counted in the online stores component of revenues. So if you adjust for those, with the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis was approximately 6%. Because of some of those, again, mostly the year-over-year accounting days, true up issue, it's showing up as negative 3% in physical stores. Dave Fildes : Yeah. And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some. So it's at 97%, still very strong, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter in other revenue as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you mentioned, but I\u2019d just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon\u2019s vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Dan Salmon : Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, can we just return to your comment earlier about the increased use of Amazon logistics, not a surprise there, but just curious through the holiday season, any particular learnings that you can offer some color on and how you view the balance between using your own proprietary logistics versus third parties as you go into 2019? And then just a quick follow-up, obviously the HQ2 news came out during the quarter, what would you highlight as maybe the most important next steps there and maybe some color on the feedback from that process, I would be interested to hear that as well? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, sure. So let\u2019s start with HQ2. Of course, in November, we announce we selected New York City and Northern Virginia and between the two cities, we will be investing $5 billion and creating more than 50000 jobs. We also announced a Operations Center of Excellence to be opened up in Nashville, which is about -- estimated to be about 5000 jobs. So right now, we're working through some next issues in both cities. We\u2019re looking forward to investing in New York and Northern Virginia and being a good community partner as well as Nashville. So not really much else to report at this time on that. On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. We added, of course, we have over 100 million items that customers would get within two days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within one day or faster in 10,000 cities in town. So Amazon deliveries are a big part of that. Again, we have great third party partners as well in the transportation space. What we like about our ability to participate in transportation is that a lot of times, we can do it at the same cost or better and we like the cost profile of the two. We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information we know where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years. So that's also another helpful side benefit for consumers when we are doing our own logistics, excuse me, transportation final delivery. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : So the AWS operating margins historically kind of move around a bit. Any color on what drove the decline sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And then I guess going back to the investment catch up theme, it sounds like 2019 will be a little bit more aggressive push from you guys. Can you parse out whether you expect the pace of retail margin expansion that we're seeing in North America right now, is that going to continue and most of these investments are going to be in international and some of the stuff going on in India and any color on the North America operating margin trajectory? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the AWS operating margin, as you called it out. That number will move around, we're very pleased with the 29.3% that we saw during the quarter. Of course, at any point in time, this business is going to be a combination of lowering prices, expanding geographically, adding people to build, especially tech teams and sales teams to build new and innovative products and staying very relevant and ahead of our customers\u2019 minds. And infrastructure, well again, it will balance between quarters a bit.  Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than the prior three quarters. That had slight impact on the operating margin, but again year-over-year, operating margins were up and were almost 280 basis points. We've said quite openly that this is going to bounce around. What we do is to create great value for the customer on one end and then work to minimize our cost of infrastructure and we're getting more and more creative around getting efficiency up and getting our cost of acquisition down. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Thank you. Please go ahead. Shelly Kay Pfeiffer : Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. You're now live. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Hey, I'm going to ask two questions, because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric, just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk to us a little bit about that. And then international sales growth decelerated 16%, I know last - ex-FX. I know last quarter you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate, how do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India? Thanks a lot. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'd start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is a measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services, which cannibalize the unit calculation, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And then, also it doesn't include Whole Foods Market. So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated. So your question was on international growth. Yeah, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we're just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There were a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance and very, very happy with the progress of the business in India. So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you'll remember with the timing of the Diwali holiday. But we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there, even despite some downtime in India. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. You are now live. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I'll also ask two, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q? Increased significantly there, it looks like cost of sales and the fulfillment, but hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in 2Q as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration, so curious what gives you the confidence in that. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Doug. Yeah, let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and 2017, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%. So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. So I would say that is a continuation of last year. But my point from the last call still holds in that, we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next three quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high-end of the revenue range, which is always good from an efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue. So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program. We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us. For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day and Prime Now selection in an accelerated basis. But this is all about the core free Two-Day offer morphing into - or evolving into a free One-Day offer. We've already started down this path. We've in the past months significantly expanded our one-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one-day shipping. So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q1's results. It's a significant step and it will take us time to achieve. And we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve this offer. And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we - Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees. And we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, and we're seeing the same thing this year. Doug Anmuth : Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : And that - sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that, although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends month to date. And we expect - we built the Q2 range about - around what we've seen. Operator : Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. You are now live. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the - not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. So while I can't share - I wouldn't share with you today the Prime - any Prime - specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think, the announcement I just made about morphing to a one-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail, as we say. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. You're now live. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down, when you strip out the accounting benefit or the last quarter, the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful. Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Yeah, we are seeing - as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally. While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers. So most of our focus has been on again adding more functionality, adding more products and adding - reporting for businesses and advertisers, so they can understand the incremental customers they're seeing on Amazon through advertising with Amazon. So it's more right now about tools and making better recommendations, making it easier to use our Amazon demand-side platform, things like that, operational improvements. And then, I guess, we're very focused on serving brands as well. That's another theme that we have. These brand stores that we have are easy to create, customize, and we've had great pickup on that from brands, but they can show shoppers who they are and tell their story. So it builds a better engagement for the brand and the customer. It builds better customer loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon. And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting - excuse me, where we're again looking to measure the new to the brand shoppers and what lift they're seeing. So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves. The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. You're now live. Stephen Ju : I'm sure you can share in regards to the Prime users' awareness of the availability of stuff from Whole Foods. Is the order flow coming in from a wide number of users? Or is the activity coming in from a small, but very dedicated number of customers? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that we're very - it's widespread and more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, hundreds of millions of dollars. We continue to expand the coverage for delivery. We have delivery from 75 - into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app. So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. That shows up in our online stores classification. So last quarter, I told you that our growth in store sales, including both shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4, and it's a similar number in Q1. So again, we're very happy with both the Prime adoption of the - or the recognition of the Prime benefits by - at Whole Foods, and also the purchases. And you may have also noticed that we lowered prices for the third major round of price cuts, since we joined forces with Whole Foods in the summer of 2017. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. You're now live. Daniel Salmon : Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe, Brian, just to return to the advertising business for a moment. It does sound like, as Eric noted, that there was a bit more of a slowdown again. I mean, I guess, I'll ask it this way. Do you believe that some of the improved relevance, some of the improved focus on brands as well as some of the new products can lead that business to reaccelerate at some point again? Or is it facing law of large numbers? And then just a follow-up, just to return to the $800 million investment to improve one-day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway already and that - in noting that it'll help contribute to the high-end of the guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly quicker. I would imagine, it's just simply expanding availability and that $800 million is largely related to shipping cost. But I just want to make sure, we're understanding that quickly that - this investment rolled out relatively quickly and starts to take effect relatively quickly. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. I'm glad you asked that. I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to two-day delivery right now, principally for two-day delivery. So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start. There is a certain tranche that we can dial up quickly, and we've started to do that and you'll see that very quickly in Q2. And then stay tuned, because we'll be building this - most of this capacity through the year in 2019. And then your question about advertising, I wouldn't comment on acceleration or deceleration of growth. I would just say, we're early on in this venture. There's a lot of - it's having a lot of pickup by both vendors, sellers and also authors. So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. You're now live. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks very much. A couple of questions. In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast. So maybe just talk a little bit about that. Is this just law of large numbers as time goes by? What is Amazon doing to sort of sustain that growth rate in the third-party marketplace business? And then second question is maybe just quickly on media spend. Just update us on how you're thinking about the trajectory of video content spend. Any strategic changes there in terms of library versus originals versus films or TV content? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Let's step back on the third-party question. So again, let me reiterate our approach. So main goal here is that it will allow customers to have the broadest selection, the best available price and also the most convenient options on how they receive the item. If we're delivering on those three elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third-party. We actively recruit sellers to sell on our platform, it's because it adds selection. It adds - if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime eligible selection. We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more successfully. So we have a vested interest in the success of our sellers. Any growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to the total sales of the customer - that we have the customers in any country. So you'll still see the percentage of third-party units increased and has been steadily over the last few years. So again, the sellers are as important to us as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and convenience. The elements I just talked about of investment, further investment in one-day shipping is directly going to be a cost that we bear and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime eligible selection in our warehouses. Dave Fildes : Yeah. And then, Anthony, just real quick, this is Dave, on your question around media and probably more particularly the video strategy and what we're investing in, I mean, we are continuing to invest meaningfully in digital video. It's an area where we're very excited about. Lots of very popular, critically acclaimed shows have obviously come out, things like Homecoming, Jack Ryan, more recently Hanna, Guava Island, and some great titles. So I think look for us to continue to invest there. There was - on the accounting side, we did adopt an accounting standard in January that amended our accounting for how we cap for produced original video content. And under that new guidance, we capitalize production cost for original video content. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of those costs. So the net impact for the first quarter to operating income wasn't material. It was - for Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of sales due to the capitalization change. As we go through 2019, though, we would expect the impact to increase in the latter part of the second half of the year, in line with our production schedule as it grows throughout the year. Operator : Our next question is from John Blackledge from Cowen and Company. You're now live. John Blackledge : Great. Thanks. Just coming back to the Prime one-day delivery, will it be available to most of the U.S. by the holidays or by the end of the year? And I think you had about 100 million items available for two-day delivery, Prime delivery. As the one-day program starts, how many SKUs will be available? And would you expect to get the entire 100 million SKUs for one-day at some point? And then second question, just on grocery, just curious the upside for further expansion outside of kind of all the enhancements you're doing with Whole Foods. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. So, yes, on the one-day free shipping versus the two-day free shipping, our goal is to evolve the two-day free shipping program into a one-day free shipping program and we're making strides on that. It got into a little bit about the capacity we have to add and changes we have to make to our supply chain in order to deliver on that. We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year. We'll have more for you at the end of Q2 obviously. There's a lot of error bars around this program, especially from the cost side. We feel we're doing something very important for the customer. And we have - again trying to take advantage of the fulfillment capacity and transportation capacity especially with third-party partners that we have. And we'll just have to see what changes have to be made to get more and more selection into that one-day category. Dave Fildes : And then, this is Dave again. Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out. We are also continuing to invest in our other grocery initiatives. Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, which offers grocery as one of the components of the selection there for the two-hour or even one-hour delivery capabilities. And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas. I mean\u2013 and in other initiatives as well, where we can get food through Pantry, Go, there's a number of initiatives there. So excited about what we'll be able to continue to bring to customers on that space. Operator : Our next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Group. You're now live. Ben Schachter : So more on the one-day shipping. Should we expect that to rely mostly on USPS, UPS or other shipping services or you're really going to try to build out more your Amazon owned and operated shipping? And on the numbers, $800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into the back half of the year? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Sure, Ben. I would say, we're going to be using all of the available levers that we have right now, both AMZL and also third-party carriers, and we'll just see how it develops going forward. But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners. So outside of the ramp, I would say that the $800 million is what I have for you today. We will see where we stand at the end of the quarter, and I'll give you insight as to what we just saw and what our outlook is for future quarters at that time. I would like to - as I don't want to run out of time here. So I'm going to ask a question for myself about AWS, because I want to get some information to you. Most of the questions I can tell around one-day are topical and important. I do want to highlight the AWS performance in Q1. We're now over $30 billion annualized run rate, 42% FX-neutral growth and $2 billion more of revenue this Q1 versus last Q1. The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business. We're continuing to engage with many large customers globally. I'm particularly happy about the Volkswagen alliance that we've joined up with them to power their Volkswagen Industrial Cloud. That's going to integrate more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers and partners in Volkswagen's global supply chain over time. We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. And I think just more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in enterprise migrations to AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. Usage growth continues to be higher than revenue growth rates. Operator : Our next question is from Mark May from Citi. You're now live. Mark May : Thank you. And actually a follow-on to AWS, the growth clearly impressive, but we did see, I think sequentially, and I apologize I'm not in front of model, but I think the growth was somewhere at 3%, 4% sequentially. There was a little bit of a slowdown in the quarter. Just wondered if there's anything that you'd call out there, pricing or any other factors that you could call out, that may have contributed to that. And apologize, but another one-day shipping question here. In terms of the $800 million, just curious where that gets you to, in terms of coverage of zip codes and SKUs? I assume right now this is a project that's in the US. And where that gets you from a coverage standpoint? And is this something that you expect to be a near- to medium-term priority in some of your other developed markets like the UK, Germany, et cetera? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. So I'm glad you asked that. So, Mark, it's - let me start with that second question. The program will be global. Most of the spend that we are seeing in Q2 is starting in North America. But this is intended to be a global improvement in speed tied to our Prime program. So you will see more going forward. I can't give you exact percentages of selection and all that, mainly because we are still again working through that. And while we have ratcheted up a significant - we turned the dial significantly in April. And so we'll see the cost impact almost immediately in the quarter. We're really going to have to see how it goes this quarter, both on our pace of selection addition and expansion of one-day, and let you know probably at the end of the quarter. I would say in the short run, it's also expanding and increasing our speed on all of our orders quite frankly. On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 49%, then 46% and 46%. So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first-half of last year. This is always going to be a lumpy business. It's not only dependent on us, it's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon, so there's a - or excuse me, AWS. So there are differences in sales cycles. There are differences in adoption of the cloud. There are differences in migration patterns that will make any quarter-to-quarter movements lumpy, as I said. So we're happy with the growth, 42% on an FX-neutral basis and again a $30 billion - greater than $30 billion annualized run rate. Operator : Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. You are now live. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. I guess somewhat along those lines or at least along the lines of growth, we saw CapEx spending and investment in capital leases decelerate to the lowest rate that it's been in several years, maybe even the lowest rate ever. And you guys have said in the past that generally CapEx sort of tracks your - that you're investing at the level of growth that you expect. I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like. So just trying to understand sort of where the disconnect is there, and to the extent that your - the level of investment in physical infrastructures says anything about your expectations for future growth, what the right way to read that is? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks for that question, Heath. No, I would say, A, we're not expecting diminished returns in any of our businesses or growth rates nor are we restraining the business or constraining the business in any way with our capital. I would point you back again to the investments that we made in 2016 and 2017. So we did front-load a lot of the investment both in fulfillment centers and also infrastructure. But more than that, it's more than kind of leading through excess capacity. We have some really, really impressive gains and efficiencies in both the warehouses and also the data centers. We talk efficiency. And every percentage utilization in our data centers is worth tens and more millions of dollars. So again, that's a big part of our model. It is not only investing, but also working on efficiencies, adding new products and features for customers. And as we lower costs, we pass those along to customers, either through new rates or new deals that we have. So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously. Moving forward, that's why I say it will be increasing as we move through the year. And that will be a constant battle between, again, growth, geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we actually need. I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity faster, so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would say. Although, we did just launched our Hong Kong region today as well and I want to point that out. The business in China is going really well and we continue to see strong growth there. And, launching the Hong Kong region gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. So it continues to be a really good story for us. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. You are now live. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I'll go to a new topic, one-day shipping. So Amazon, the first principle is customer obsession. And, Brian, you talked about record Prime sub-growth last year. I guess the question is what are the signals or the key strategic rationale behind investing in one-day? Are there certain types of users, demographics of users, categories of products, countries you think this will help you attract and retain? It seems like Prime is growing pretty well. Just talk us through what you see as the big opportunity to invest in one-day? And then the second one, just maybe talk to us a little bit about the early learnings on the healthcare industry side of potentially trying to move larger into healthcare? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Great. Yeah, Brian, I would say it's as simple as price selection and convenience, which is the mantra that we talk about quite often. By going to one-day, it increases the convenience and it increases the available selection into the consideration set. Although, we have many items that are available in one to two hours, and also same day, the vast majority of our selection is available to you in two days. If we get that to one-day, we literally cut it in half, that's tough math for you. I'm sorry to do that. But the - we think that that will open up a lot of potential purchases that - and it will open up convenience to those customers. So we've been experimenting on a lot of different formats as you know, two-day, one-day, same-day, two-hour, stores, there's all types of - points of being there for the customer, when they need us at different points in their consideration set. So we really think it's going to be groundbreaking for Prime customers. And we're very excited to add this capability. And, again, part of this is we have the capability, because we've been at this for over 20 years and continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity, our logistics capacity and also fine-tune it. But I thank you for your question. Dave Fildes : Yeah, Brian, and this is Dave. Just briefly on healthcare, I mean, that term can touch upon any number of different parts of our businesses. Of course, we've talked in the past about how Amazon Business serves many other companies, including the healthcare industry and providing them some great selection. And fast delivery is part of that - the business program there. So - and that continues to do well and it's a focus of Amazon Business amongst other verticals there that they serve. PillPack, we're probably around 6 months or so in since that acquisition closed, and continuing to support them in their mission and learn from them certainly. So no real update on that, but excited about the potential there to be sure. Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Brian Nowak : I have two. It looks like the overall retail business accelerated pretty nicely in the quarter. Maybe could you just talk about whether 24-hour shipping is in that? So which specific categories of consumption are you seeing really drive that acceleration? And then sort of the opposite question on AWS, which has slowed a little bit can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We feel this really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services. And continually again AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem, and also the stronger security that we offer. On your question about one-day, let me update you on that, because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering. In Q2, we had a meaningful step up in the one-day shipments, primarily in North America. And volume -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only in being able to expand one-day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month. So we're in the middle of the journey here. We expect to see continued ramp of the one-day selection availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international. International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be in future quarters there. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply one day, the additional one day in Q2. We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. We saw some additional transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly, both local capacity in the off-season also in our delivery networks. We also saw some costs were moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to customers. And we built that not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today. And as I said in other setting, we've seen this before. We have had large changes to our distribution and transportation network repeatedly in our history from going from media to a vast variety of different product lines hardlines non-sortable as we call them. The initial two-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase one-day and same day although on a much smaller scale. So, it does create a shock to the system. We're working through that now. We expect we'll be working through that for a number of quarters, but when the dust settles, we will regain our cost efficiency over time. As far as you asked about specific product lines, nothing really to share there. We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America and we could be that we're mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch one-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Just wondering back on the AWS side of things, can you give us a sense of sort of what you're seeing from a volume perspective? Obviously, price is always a big component of growth in this, but just trying to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth rate deceleration on the volume side of things. And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either revenue or usage within that business. Are there any products or sort of product areas AI obviously being one that's been a major initiative for you that you're seeing particular either outside growth or under growth relative to the overall business that you would call out? Brian Olsavsky : Yes, sure. On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption and machine learning services especially Amazon Sage Maker. We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine learning services and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those customers. We released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 2018 alone in this area. Database is also a multibillion-dollar business propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of strength. We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual increased pace of enterprise migrations. So, I would say that on a percentage growth basis again on a dollar basis, it's going very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year. There's some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses. But for the most part, we continue to grow usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very happy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Justin Post : Great. Couple of questions. I guess, the first question is just happens with the customer behavior when they do have one-day availability? I'm assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a category that switches to one-day what happens? And the second question, we've heard from some smaller checks that some of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the one piece side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind of focus more towards third-party from first-party? Thanks a lot. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on the move to one-day. I did say that generally in Q2 the unit volume was greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I think what you're saying is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for our customers. So things that maybe they can't wait two days on, they can wait one day, and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site. I've noticed that personally myself that just -- with one-day shipments, it's here before you know it. So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over time. On your comment, I assume you meant vendors not merchants, but on the move from 1P to 3P, but no there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related shifting in channel there, but I would say that we remain in different on whether -- we're focused on price convenience and selection for our customers. And whether product is a retail offering or third-party offering is not that important to us. As long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively. So, as you know our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time and increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. We continue to invest very heavily in our systems both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of then making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasingly not only vendor sales, but also third-party merchant sales. In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses. So when we win, we win together with our vendor partners and also our seller partners. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. So in the release you made a comment about automotive and Alexa, anything you want to elaborate a little more that looks like that's a very interesting opportunity? And then with respect to India, there were two comments in the release, but anything you can comment on kind of getting past some of the issues that had impacted the business in the past? I know you're past that now. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Let me start with India. So yes, continue to see growth in programs for both sellers -- for our sellers and delivery partners. In the last 18 months, we've doubled the number of paid Prime member, which we're very excited about. We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian sellers not only reach customers in India, but also in other geographies around the world. We started Amazon Flex in India, which helps our local partners to deliver packages, gives them jobs, grows our delivery capacity for sellers and increases our speed of delivery. So it's a win-win. We've also introduced package-free shipment program in nine cities. This is going to be a big part of our shipment zero program, a vision to make all Amazon shipment net carbon zero. On the government side, our engagement with the Indian government makes us optimistic about partnering and collaborating to seek a stable predicable policy that allow us to continue investing in our technology and infrastructure. And it also helps us to create jobs and scale local businesses. So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year. The events we have for Diwali were all in Q4 last year some of them are in Q3 this year based on the timing of the holiday. So, that's factored into our international \u2013 excuse me, our, revenue growth rate for the quarter. Dave Fildes : Yes, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the Alexa point and auto, Alexa is really a more and more place. I think the point you're probably referencing is, we're now seeing hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built in. So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and another smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicle. So we've seen a lot of good partnerships and arrangements with companies like BMW and Mini and not just in the U.S., but in places like Europe as well. So a lot of this of course is just around the great power of Alexa and being able to offer even greater convenience and touch points where customers can interact with that and we're seeing a lot of good momentum with usage and how customers are interacting with Alexa. But also when you look at the broader environment of third-party devices, devices that we're rolling out in all of those things it's -- we're seeing a lot of good momentum there. And I think it's underpinned by the fact that Alexa is always getting smarter and so customers are enjoying the benefit of that enhanced experience. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please proceed. Youssef Squali : Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions for me please. Can you quantify the cost of one-day shipping to Q3 guidance kind of similarly to what you did into 4Q too with that $800 million? And if they plateau how should be thinking about it, as we map it out over the next several quarters? And then you guys made a very intriguing acquisition, the Sizmek acquisition sometime back. I'm just wondering, how does it fit in the overall strategy? And is the idea to try to build may be a double click like-minded model, sorry using that platform? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Hi, Youssef. Let me start your question on one-day. I'm not breaking out the specific cost this quarter as I did last year -- last quarter. Some of this is because it's very hard to pinpoint exactly the lines between one-day and other cost issues. So we're always working within a range. We're confidently we were near but just above our $800 million estimate in Q2. And as I said, this is going to take multiple quarters to play out. We had a meaningful step up in North America in Q2 and it was accelerating through the quarter. We'll see more cost in Q3. We'll see about Q4 when we talk and everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance. So I wouldn't break out the dollar term. I will tell you at the end of the quarter kind of what we're seeing on cost and how it looks for Q4 as well. And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters. Dave Fildes : Yes. And then just on Sizmek quickly. We are excited to have acquired the Sizmek ad server and then Sizmek's dynamic creative optimization or DCO. Customers are going to be able to continue to use those proven products and services. We're invested in the long-term success of Sizmek. And again, Amazon advertising and Sizmek has many mutual customers, so we know how valued these prudent solutions are to the customer base. So we're looking forward to work with that team and we'll share more updates as we invent and create new opportunities to serve advertisers in the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Sir, your line is live. Mark Mahaney : Sorry about that. Hey Brian could you talk a little bit about the elasticity you're seeing -- you expect to see in international markets with the rollout of one-day? And I just -- the commentary in the press release about this acceleration from one-day, sounds great. It's a little surprising that you would see the reaction that quickly. But maybe this really is -- well you're obviously seeing it. You're confident you'll also see it as you roll out into international markets, if you could just comment on that? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. The -- of course the proportion of one-day shipments is higher in international to begin with in a lot of our countries. So we will -- we expect it to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that one-day category. But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime. So yes, I would say, you're faced with the -- you see it every time you go to our site. It's automatically built in. You're surprised by the speed. It's not like you have to search one-day shipping specifically to find out what's available. It's growing and it's pervasive. So I think what that does is, again it strengthens your purchase decision, it strengthens the need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product because you need it quickly. So I think it's becomes a part of your routine. At least that's what we're seeing in North America. And we hope again as we build this capacity to more and more regions and more and more ZIP codes and adding more and more selection that everyone will see the same thing that we see already in major cities. I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating income in both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of one-day, I would like to highlight there's some other investment areas that are certainly going on here. If you look at Q2, our marketing expense was up 48% year-over-year and that's a combination of a few things. First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales and marketing teams. We see great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products. So we continue to build out our sales force and our marketing programs. We're also adding more and more advertising as we roll out devices and Prime Video -- new Prime Video content in particular internationally. So we're seeing higher marketing costs. We're also seeing a higher stock-based compensation expense. That was up 36% year-over-year. And you'll see that our headcount grew 13% year-over-year. So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on total headcount. So there's a lot of moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong investment going on in AWS devices and videos in particular. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed. Ross Sandler : Hey guys, just two questions. The North America retail acceleration was 3.5 points and you mentioned international is about one. So can we attribute the difference to one-day? Or was there other organic acceleration in North America happening aside from the move to one-day? And then Brian related to that investing question, AWS operating margin came down a bit. I know they had a tough comp. But anything you would call out aside from the headcount stuff that you just mentioned that may have been lumpy in the quarter on AWS? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with that second question. So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. We had a -- we've come off a period where if you remember last year we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total. The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%. So we had that dynamic. Our trailing 12-month growth in that number is 21% after Q2. So it's stepped up from 9% to 21%. So we are starting to see as I mentioned in earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019, so started to see that in Q2. But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses. Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North America to international. But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that. If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our retention of Prime members. But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Pleased proceed. Mark May : Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. First I guess sort of an organizational question, but some of the feedback I've heard from the ecosystem is that it appears that the combination of the way Amazon's organized internally and just rapid growth in the ad business 1P, 3P that at times there are signs that kind of these teams internally are not always aligned and maybe that creates some issues. And just wonder first do you generally agree with this? And if so, what is the company doing to kind of better optimize these increasingly related functions that maybe in the past haven't always been organized internally that way? And then secondly in terms of subscription revenue where are we in terms of the benefit from the price increase announcement announced last year and rolled through to existing members throughout the last year and will this have any meaningful impacts in that lines growth say in Q3 of the back half of the year? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. So, I assume your first question is about the coordination of advertiser with teams that are interacting with vendors and sellers, perhaps is that what you meant? Mark May : Exactly. Yes. Brian Olsavsky : Okay. Yes, so, first, I'd say we're customer-focused first and primarily, but we need to have good coordination across our teams and we grow fast and we add new things. So, there's always learnings that we have that's why we say it's still day one here. But we're trying to minimize the negative impact on any vendor or seller out there. So, I can't comment on any certain -- on exactly what issues you might be talking about. We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon. But as you say they're separately run and they can meet at different points and sometimes at certain vendors perhaps that may get out of hand are get out of sync. But hopefully that is a temporary condition. On subscription revenue, yes, we -- you remember we raised the price of Prime in the U.S. last June from $99 to $119. So, the largest impact -- favorable impact from that at least from a subscription revenue standpoint would have happened in the subsequent four quarters, less in Q2, more in Q3 through Q2 of this year. So, yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. Its offset by the growth in the Prime program itself and the expansion of Prime Benefits or the Prime program globally. You may see that -- may have seen we have launched Prime in United Arab Emirates this quarter. So, it's not something -- it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing of price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks. I guess first up curious just a follow-up on the ASP comments if those were \u2013 if that shift within the same categories or just lower ASPs imply diversification into new categories. But my main question is just looking ahead of the holiday period given some of the moving parts and 3PL and shipping ecosystem and then of course with the transition to one-day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own first-party logistics as well as third-party partners to meet that seasonal demand and should we now expect a faster ramp in Amazon Air as the means to move cargo between fulfillment centers? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. So, I would say the first time we started discussing the rollout of one-day our first thoughts went to Q4 this year and our capability for holiday and as much as Q2 and Q3. So we are confident that we will have the ability to handle seasonal demand. We are working very hard to expand our one-day capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and have our partners expand their capabilities as well. So we're feeling good about Q4. It's a little early to discuss that now, but we certainly had a really good test on Prime Day. It was the two biggest days we've ever had. A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well. So it was a good test for us. And, sorry, your question on low ASP, I think we're still figuring that out a bit. I mean they -- what I'm reacting to is the high unit growth relative to good growth in revenue, but unit growth grew faster. I'm always a little vary to put too much into the unit growth number. As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that's excludes AWS subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, which are some of the fastest growing areas and we also have \u2013 are actively selling subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can cannibalize unit sales. So there's a lot of moving parts, usually our headwinds to our unit growth number, but again happy with the 800 basis point quarter-over-quarter jump in that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brent Thill : Thanks. Brian just on the op income guide for the next quarter, it's significantly below where many of us are at. I'm curious if you could just talk to any changes around expenses and the success of one day just doubling down or can you just walk through what's transpires in the next quarter? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, sure. So again the biggest individual item is the one-day shipping. As I said earlier, we had a meaningful step up in shipments in Q2 versus Q1, but we're still on our way and Q3 will be a step up over Q2 in North America and we'll see more in international. So it's -- that increase in one-day shipping and all the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity in place. As I mentioned earlier new costs and things like expanding inventory, getting it closer to the customer. Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transport networks. So that is the biggest individual contributor but as I mentioned in Q2's results, some of the investments in marketing, the step up in infrastructure spending that should continue. We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest not the least of which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of our Prime Benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery through Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh. So I would say, yes, we had -- as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity. We expected a step up in 2019. We didn't see as much of it in Q1, mainly because of the timing of the seasonality of the year and getting things going. We\u2019re seeing more of it in Q2 and we'll see it through the remainder of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Maybe a few small questions on the advertising side of the business if I can. How much of the advertising business would you be willing to say is driven by domestic sellers and domestic brands versus the international side? Two, how do you think about the video ad revenue opportunity? We continue to hear from a lot of people in the advertising industry that you might be a bigger player in video advertising later this year or more into next year, how do you think about making investments against that possibility or even just possibility of being a driver in your platform overall? Thanks so much for the color guys. Dave Fildes : Yes, Eric this is Dave. I think started with the video advertising that one focus areas for us is expanding our video and over the top offerings for brands. We've taken some steps with live sports and then IMDb TV, but we'll continue to do things like add more OTT video supply, just things like Amazon Publisher service integrations and simplifying access for third-party apps and add more inventory through things like Fire TV apps and IMDb TV. So some interesting areas that we're continue to put a lot of focus into. Now the first part of your question, in terms of geographical mix, I mean, fair to assume that like a lot of our business, advertising in the North America segment is the bigger piece of that, but I think we're really excited about the international opportunity. A lot of the tools that we've rolled out introduced in places like the United States aren't available in many of the international regions. And so, it's a matter of continuing to work with advertisers and brands and kind of buildup, not only awareness but just how those -- add things like sponsored products interact with customers and how they receive -- building up the things we talk about many times here around improving relevancy on each of those geographic websites is an important thing that we're measuring. So, expected to continue see us look for new ways to be able to roll that out. Dave Fildes : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com, Q3 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead. Shelly Kay Pfeiffer : Hello, and welcome to our Q3, 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.  As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, October 24, 2019 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to know if I could go a little bit deeper in the framework you gave around revenue guidance for Q4.  Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate in Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they reaccelerated in Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or some of the things in e-commerce business, whether there are things we should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or a tailwind perspective, as we think through some of the moving pieces in Q4? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Hi, Eric. Yes, let me make clear, we are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our One Day shipping. The ops team has done a great job getting us to a position where we are in and I think that\u2019s going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4. On the guidance front, here\u2019s what I would have you keep in mind. If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years.  There has been a noticeable drop in run rate, between Q3 and Q4 generally on the lines of about 300 basis points. We are factoring that in this year, that\u2019s just something we\u2019re expecting. It\u2019s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that\u2019s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year. So we factor that in, and then there\u2019s also two other issues. The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year and a bit of it was in Q3 this year. Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, and what we saw was a pre-buy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter, and based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many years ago, we\u2019ve expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan.  So if you wrap those together, we expect it\u2019s going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4. For the company, it\u2019s not as large an issue. There is about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it\u2019s expected to be about 80 basis point headwind in Q4. So that\u2019s a little bit more on our guidance, but again we are really looking forward to Q4.  I think we\u2019re well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers. I think One Day should help with holiday shipping. We\u2019ve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, we\u2019re looking forward to our re :Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as you\u2019ve been increasing availability?  And then how should we think about that availability now, and when we get into the heart of the holiday season? And can you also just help us understand how that\u2019s playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with the second part of that. So back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense tied to One Day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2. In Q3, we expected that to grow, we put into our guidance and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance. So as we head into Q4, we\u2019ve added what\u2019s just nearly a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional poles and shifts in our warehouses, the cost for deploying inventory closer to customers, there\u2019s a lot of tangential costs, by and a way the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.  So we\u2019ve built that into our Q4 guidance estimate, but we\u2019re very pleased with the customer response to One Day. You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again the ops team has really done yeoman\u2019s work here to create this capacity for us and they continue to unlock additional capacity daily.  We\u2019re expecting that it will be again a great help to customers in Q4. We have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so that they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed. Youssef Squali : Great, thank you so much. Brian, kind of just a couple of quick ones. Of the 400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think you guys said was a record day for you versus One Day shipping. Just trying to extract one versus the other, because obviously going into Q4 you\u2019re only going to have the latter.  And then on \u2013 a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the side. Can you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is the higher OpEx 4Q also driven at least in part by the higher investment to combat that? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, sure. So on the second one, I would say we\u2019re certainly very diligent on trying to catch counterfeit products. We put a lot of effort into that, we put a lot of human effort, we put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort into that as well.  But I would say the bigger investments in Q4 are certainly two-fold: One around the One Day shipping that I just mentioned. The other would be on AWS. We continue to invest in AWS. If you look at the progression of our operating margin in that business, it reached a high of 31% last Q4, excuse me Q3. That was a time when we were \u2013 as we mentioned at the time it was very efficient, we had been banking some savings from forward investments in infrastructure in 2017.  We continue to feel really good about not only the top line, but also the bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in sales force and marketing personnel, mainly to handle a you know wider group of customers, an increasingly wide group of products, we continue to add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to expand geographically.  So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also to a secondary extent, infrastructure, which if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on a trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year and that was 9% last year. So there has been a step up in infrastructure costs to support the higher usage demand. So we see those trends continuing into Q4, and that\u2019s essentially, probably the other element of operating income year-over-year, that\u2019s shorter than in prior quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the One Day costs, I appreciate the color. I\u2019m curious to hear about how you think about what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structurally? It sounds like there are some shipping costs in there.  Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps, you have to take over the next one to two years to get the One Day shipping costs closer to what they used to be for Two Day, and how do you think about how long it\u2019s going to take?  And then secondly on One Day, I think it\u2019s mostly U.S. to-date, is that right? And then if not, how do you think about sort of timing on pushing more internationally? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Yes, most of the expense has been in the U.S., but we have also increased our One Day selection internationally. We\u2019re starting to see some benefits from that. But I would say the biggest impact so far, both on the top line lift and also the bottom line cost is in the U.S. You know we\u2019re still learning here on the One Day costs as we go about what the long-term cost structure will be. We know we have temporary costs in the short run as we do things like forward deploy inventory, get greater inbound into those warehouses, set up new Amazon Logistics, AMZL capacity, staff you know multiple shifts, so that we can have later pull times to hit One Day cut-offs, things like that, adding sort centers.  So it\u2019s a you know drastic change to the whole network topology that would \u2013 you know we\u2019re glad to do and working through it and we\u2019ve been down this road before obviously, and a number of different incarnations in Amazon history. So we will keep posted on a, you know quarterly basis as best we can, but right now, really forward guiding is for Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. I know most of the focus on One Day has been on speed, but based on the vans we\u2019re all seeing, it would seem that the shift to more of your own last mile infrastructure is maybe the bigger part of this.  As it scales and you get to higher levels of efficiency and utilization, does that become margin accretive or profitability accretive relative to using the third parties almost exclusively in the way that you have in the past? And then this was also a very big hiring quarter for you, 100,000 people. Can you give us a sense of where those people are going you know relative to AWS fulfillment, retail, kind of understanding sort of where they have been prioritized? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thank you for your questions Heath. On the first question, I think it boils down to whether it will be competitive long term with other options out there. Yes, we will be, we believe that. In many cases we are already are and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance, in some cases we\u2019re lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we\u2019re doing. But in the long run we\u2019re going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that we\u2019ve used in the past. So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we\u2019ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well.  But on the cost side, yes it\u2019s going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity.  On the headcount question, yes we increased as you said close to 100,000 people in Q3. I mean we are up 22% year-over-year. In the past that pointed to investments in technology teams and that\u2019s certainly part of it, but by in a way the biggest driver this time is the people that we\u2019re adding for fulfillment and transportation roles, especially as we head into Q4 and add this additional transportation capacity to service One Day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Stephen Ju : Okay, thank you. So Brian, I\u2019m wondering if you can weigh in on the puts and takes on the long-term potential margin for AWS? When this was first launched it pretty much sold itself and now you are employing a greater number of salespeople, and with that I guess the incremental marketing dollars. But on the other hand it seems like the engineering talent hiring should slow down over time. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can weigh in on what\u2019s coming in or what\u2019s coming out. Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah, sure. I would say the margins \u2013 our margins expectations are that we will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to customers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form of new products that will in effect cannibalize the old ones.  And we also see a point out that you know increasingly what we\u2019re doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who then commit to us long term. And if you look at our disclosure on our 10-Q, it shows that we have $27 billion in future commitments for AWS, from AWS customers and that\u2019s up 54% year-over-year. So that\u2019s another thing to watch, it\u2019s not only the short-term commitment, but also the long-term commitment that we see. On the rest of the P&L, there again we have, I believe some of the best infrastructure people in the industry. If not the best, we are continually driving up efficiency and lowering costs and we see that in our bottom line.  The sales and marketing investment, we\u2019re chasing a large opportunity here and that will be, you know as we say bumpy as we go along, but we are fully confident that that will be a very leveraged cost as we get to scale.  And then on the technology side, as you said, yes we will continue and invest in SDEs and software engineers to build these you know products that customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that will push or inform our product portfolio. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Can you talk about the key drivers of the acceleration in what looks like advertising revenue within other and related to that, the press release mentions I think you are now $37 million Fire Stick users worldwide. So can you talk about maybe how much ad inventory you\u2019ve been able to get inside of networks within that and how meaningful is this to the overall kind of advertising strategy. Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, so let me start with the first question on advertising. So other revenue, which is principally advertising grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last quarter and the biggest thing in there is advertising and advertising grew at a rate higher than that 45%.  So we are very happy with the progress in the advertising business, continue to focus on advancing advertising experiences there, helpful for customers, helping them to see new products, we want to empower our businesses to find attracting and engage these customers and it\u2019s increasingly popular with vendor sellers and third-party advertisers. So it\u2019s still early and what we\u2019re focused on really at this point is relevancy, making sure that the ads are relevant to our customers, helpful to our customers, and to do that, we use machine learning and that\u2019s helping us to drive better, better and better relevancy. Dave Fildes : Yeah. And then Lloyd, this is Dave. Just quickly on Fire TV. I mean I have to start with the fact that we did recently introduce 20 new Fire TV products, so that includes the new \u2013 and the first Fire TV Edition Sound Bar, Fire TV Cube. So a number of things have come out recently. We\u2019re really excited to get into customers\u2019 hands, so more to come there.  I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we are continuing to see some increased adoption. You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands. It\u2019s still early in this space, but we\u2019ve done a few things with IMDb TV, Live Sports, things like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps, and as I said IMDb TV, adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS integrations and streamlining access for third party apps and really just making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide better results. So, as I said early days, but I think with the engagement of the device community, the fact that we\u2019re really excited with the progress and improvements of these devices, I think yeah, again a lot of opportunity there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed. Scott Devitt : Thanks. There has been a meaningful reacceleration in paid unit growth in the past two quarters with the expansion of the One Day guarantees for Prime customers, and I\u2019m just wondering if consumers are responding more in certain categories that you would highlight over others or is the response fairly broad-based across the product categories where One Day has been expanded? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Hi, Scott. Yeah, what I can tell you is that yes, the unit growth has been reaccelerated in the last two quarters and actually Amazon Fulfilled unit growth is growing at a higher clip. So we do attribute it to One Day.  We\u2019re seeing broad sales across all categories. So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that we\u2019ve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Mark Mahaney : Hey, thanks, I want to go back to AWS. When asked about margins, you first referred to \u2013 Brian you first referred to by bringing down prices. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the level of price competition? Could you talk about what kind of traction you\u2019ve had building out into the enterprise, and I know it\u2019s a broad question, but take a shot at it. And third part of this is, your interest and your success in going in and generating more app \u2013 you know going up the stack and getting more into the application software space, all that AWS related. Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Hi, Mark. So yeah, I would say my comments around pricing were as much mix as absolute price decreases or competitive price pressures. It\u2019s certainly a competitive market that we see and we\u2019ve seen for really a number of years. So everyone is very sharp on their pricing and is very eager to lock up long-term commitments from AWS customers.  We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched. So the bigger element of that really is around us creating new products and services that are cheaper and less expensive than the old ones. So there is a certain bit of mix issue that we are always up against.  But again in your question on enterprise penetration, you know I think the enterprise, we\u2019re making great progress there. You know it\u2019s going to be hard on revenue growth, it\u2019s going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make or some are faster than others and some have other work to do before they can migrate.  So you know there\u2019s a lot of factors at play there on the enterprise business, but we are having great success and we\u2019re adding a lot of sales force or sales representatives, especially for the enterprise market. Dave Fildes : Yeah, and Mark, this is Dave. Just really quickly just in terms of your question on the stack. I mean I think for really since as long as AWS has been around, we really pride ourselves in getting really top, high caliber people both in the technical side, but also sales people that are plugged in and listening to customers, understanding issues that are emerging, having open lines of communication and that\u2019s really allowed us to innovate quickly and really faster than anyone else, and we see that in the terms of the service and feature breadth and depth that we have. So, a lot of the focus for us is really making sure that that flywheel keep spinning, and that we continue to roll out a lot of great services the customers are looking for. So I think that\u2019s largely what dictates our roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether it\u2019s kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed. Colin Sebastian : Thanks. Maybe first is a follow-up on the logistics and delivery side. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some sense for the portion of SKUs in the U.S. or orders in the U.S. that are now delivered through your own network of drivers and partners.  And then secondly, there have been some reports that Amazon is or on occasion is delivering products for other merchants or suppliers, not specifically tied to an Amazon order. So just wondering if you view this as another potential opportunity down the road as you get excess capacity and on the logistics side? Thanks. Dave Fildes : Yeah Colin, hey it\u2019s Dave. Thanks for the question. On that second point, in terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think you know \u2013 I\u2019d start with, you know we\u2019ve got a great relationship with third party carriers across the countries where we operate.  Over time I think you know we\u2019ll look and expect to be able to grow our internal volume using AMZL or Amazon Logistics, but also continue to grow our 3P volumes with carriers, transporters around the world. But our focus is really on ensuring that we\u2019ve got capacity from available resources, whether it\u2019s our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure we\u2019re able to deliver those things quickly and reliably. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Justin Post : Great, thank you all; it\u2019s going to be a couple here. Just wondering back on the shorter holiday season, do you think that\u2019s going to be a headwind for overall online sales in the quarter, anything specific to Amazon?  And then secondly, just thinking about the regulatory environment. I wonder if you could just comment on the opportunities and the competitiveness for third-party sellers. Are there other platforms that you see for them and how do you think about their profitability on Amazon, if you can comment on that at all? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, yeah. On third party I would say we only succeed if the third party sellers succeeds. So we\u2019re heavily invested in them as they are in us. So we are constantly investing on their behalf, adding new products and features and you know we are cognizant of their economics as well and we want a business that works for both of us and we set our fees accordingly. So I think that you know we\u2019ve \u2013 and I\u2019ll also point out that with the One Day, the increase in One Day sellers have participated, and not as much as anyone else, as much as our 1P offering. So, it\u2019s been a great boon for sellers as well as, particularly in our FBA program.  On the holiday season question, we are not anticipating that the move of you know the shorter time period between Thanksgiving and you know Christmas Day is going to be that impactful. What we found in the past is that there is generally a holiday budget that is spent somewhere between November 15 and - November 1 maybe and December 25, and well certainly Black Friday and Cyber Monday are important dates in that holiday period.  You know there is - the purchase tend to move around. Some have been moving early in the quarter, some of them moving later in the quarter as customers can count on and receive very quick shipments at the end and have higher faith in delivery just before the holidays. So that\u2019s a little bit color, that\u2019s what\u2019s anticipated in our guidance that we\u2019ve given. Dave Fildes : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead. Shelly Kay Pfeiffer : Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, January 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Operator : At this time, we will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types, that you felt like drove the strength particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year? Brian Olsavsky : Hi Heath. No, I would not isolate it to any one set of customers or products. I think it's been pretty broad-based, and it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams, and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries. So, I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is -- leads the market, and we add to it at a quicker pace than our competition, so actually the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak. We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And we continue to expand. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 geographic regions. So, I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs, and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thank you. Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the strength in seller services, how much of that was third-party marketplace commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of the other content and services? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter if that's what you're referring to 31% growth in revenue. It was strong on a unit basis. And as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA which has higher fee set than MFN does. So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed. Justin Post : Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could go high level, what drove upside to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side? Anything there that you'd really call out? And then on the AWS investments, obviously you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange, but what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. We also had a very big uptick in response to the one-day availability that's been building through the year. I think Prime has been very strong. We mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally now. And we mentioned that more people joined Prime in Q4 than any other quarter before. So, a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping. On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in 2018 when the margins in AWS were closer to 30% about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years. So, we continue to -- since that point, we've continued to add infrastructure capability and -- to support our global expansion as well. But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers. You notice on our balance sheet that our future commitments on the multiyear deals now stands at $30 billion at year-end, and that's up 54% year-over-year. So, there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Just to ask about AWS again. I mean, the investors have become, I guess, recently concerned just about again the slowing AWS revenue and margin and whether it's a function of increased competition. So, maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts, but just any more you can talk about the competitive environment? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So, we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So, we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers. As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We've learned from customers. We just had a great re :Invent conference in December where all of our -- it was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at those events, we not only get to present our new products and there were over 100 that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer issues and help -- that helps to sign or educate our forward road map. So, it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different phases : first, moving to the cloud, then organizing on the cloud, and then growing further. So there's a lot of movement. I said that repeatedly I think in the setting that any -- quarter quarter-to-quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy. But generally, what you're seeing is the convergence of a lot of investment, a lot of operational efficiency, and a lot of innovation on behalf of customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Stephen Ju : Okay. So thank you. I wanted to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can do to reduce friction between logistics payments and some of the other factors there? And second, what are these SMBs selling? Is it like long-tail inventory? Is it merchandise that you can get to exports to global buyer base? And do you think this could be content that could be exclusive to Amazon? Thank you. Dave Fildes : Yes Stephen, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen. We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing those say MSMBs micro-small and medium-sized businesses. We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025. So, this $1 billion investment will help to enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025. A lot of different facets to those types of investments, won't go into too much for specifics, but a lot of work being done there. We're also focused on job growth, job creation over there. Since we launched over in India in 2013, we've created over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs. So -- we also recently announced plans to create additional one million jobs in India by 2025. So, a lot of -- I think innovation, ideas, investment. That team over there continues to do a great job locally of taking a lot of the tenants that we've had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new services and features that I think are specific to that region. And hopefully, as we continue to do that, we'll keep identifying areas over in India and tool sets features over in India that we can bring back to other regions to help benefit other sellers and the other websites more broadly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, the first one Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with one-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter. Maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the largest qualitative fix in variable costs sort of still associated with one-day and the processes and the opportunities for efficiency to really get that number down as we go throughout 2020. And then, maybe any specific product categories or good categories where you've seen an acceleration in demand from one day that you\u2019d call out? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me make sure the numbers are understood. We had talked about last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter. We -- that carried into Q3-- was slightly higher in Q3. And then in Q4, last time on this call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty. It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance. And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year. And again, in Q2, we'll start to lap this. And that doesn't mean the delta goes to zero. It means that there'll be a step up as we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one day. So, I will keep you posted on our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going. If you look at the efficiency or the -- first the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets. It's obviously transportation where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries. Partners are adding new routes. Many times they start with subscale volumes and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density and that creates efficiency. When we started this, again, Q2 of last year, we also had abrupt change to our fulfillment network in that, when it's tuned for two-day delivery on the most part when you move to one-day in a lot of cases, it's advantageous from a cost and transportation standpoint to have that inventory closer to the customer. So, we've -- last year we're in the middle of that transition. We still are as we shift inventory to be more local, it will enable local deliveries to hit shorter cutoff times. So, that will continue to become more efficient. We do see -- we will have to scale our fulfillment center network further. We grew the square footage for fulfillment and transportation by 15% each of the last two years. And we'll look ahead and see a step-up in that this year as we start to build more capacity for the one-day. I haven't guided beyond Q1, but that's certainly something that will step up. But we get efficiencies as we learn and grow and handle more one-day volume. Third area is foregone ship revenue just simply, because we're having free shipment and not charging for it. That unfortunately doesn't leverage, but it -- we do start to lap after a while. So, I would say that just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse system over the years from going to -- from media to almost every product you can imagine, to having a cycle of increased third-party presence in the FBA program now to one-day, we have a history here where we can look for opportunities to be more efficient and lower the -- any cost penalties as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. Dan Salmon : Thanks for taking the question guys. Brain, just to follow-up on one-day shipping. You noted that you begin to lap the beginning of the initiative here in the second quarter and that naturally costs can flow up with volumes. But just to be clear with you is the idea here is we anniversary at that sort of incremental expansion of one-day shipping either regionally or certain SKUs is functionally finished. I just want to make sure I understand that properly. And then just -- we can see the other number reported. Just any color within there on the advertising business. And in particular would love to hear an update just a bit on some of your brand initiatives there. I know that probably wasn't the focus in the holiday season, but it seems to be an important growing part. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start on the one-day. So, yeah, we do see expansion of the one-day program as we move through the year. We've been expanding since we started this effort in Q2 of last year. Expansion means additional cities, additional routes, additional zip codes. But more -- I think what you'll see more in 2020 is also an -- more effort internationally, more costs internationally. We have greatly improved our selection of one-day in -- particularly in Europe and Japan. We started with higher one-day percentage of our shipments in those geographies, but we do have to take steps and are taking steps to increase that. And we expect that to be -- it started to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020. Dave Fildes : Yeah, Dan. In terms of your question around brands. We're focused on the certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So, things that we're really excited about stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are share their story. So, we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option. Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas. I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers, because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this given our retail business. On the advertising business, or rather I should say other revenue that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. Line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is as a subset been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part question on AWS if I can. You called out the depreciation change with respect to AWS going forward. Just wanted to better understand some of the decisions that were made on useful life that drove that decision and how to think about that from a modeling perspective going forward? And then the second part would be what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks for bringing that up. So, we as a practice monitor and review, the useful life of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. In Q4 -- and we've been looking at it in both the FCs, fulfillment centers and also AWS annually. As we looked in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's -- there's enough trend now to show that the useful life is exceeding four years. We have been -- for our servers and we had been depreciating them over three years. So, we are going to start depreciating them on a four year basis. It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period and then new assets will be put into play will extend out for four years instead of three and we'll continue to revisit this. I do want to point out it's not just an accounting-related change. It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer. We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses. So -- and despite that we give AWS customers and actually because of this, AWS customers continue to get access to the latest technologies more quickly than ever before. So, we are essentially reflecting the fact that we have gotten better at extending the useful life here and now building that into our financials moving forward. Yes, you're right. It should also impact our need and our timing of capital. I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area. But its $800 -- excuse me $800 million lower depreciation expense in the quarter and it will be consistent. It will change quarter-to-quarter. We will update you. But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact in Q2 2020. Dave Fildes : Yes. This is Dave. Just kind of on the modeling point too on that the $800 million is in Q1. We do think that the -- for that accounting impact effectively, we expect that that amount will decrease as we go through the year. And it's tech infrastructure assets. So, it's -- I should say the servers are tech infrastructure assets. So, when you think about segments the majority of these relate to the AWS segment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I just want to ask a little bit more about the holiday season, given the beat on the top line and see if there's any way to quantify maybe the impact from the shortened holiday shopping season. I mean, it doesn't seem like much just given the better results and in online sales and retail third-party seller services. But is there any way to think about the six less days? And then also you mentioned last quarter, an impact from the Japanese consumption tax. Any sort of impact? Did that go according to plan or any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. First of all on the -- there were two items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1. The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. So, it was a help to Q3 and a penalty to Q4. Those two items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. That was our estimate and we believe that was the actual outcome. Dave Fildes : On the international? Brian Olsavsky : On the international segment excuse me yes. The -- sorry the first question was for the holiday season. Yes, we don't see that as a factor actually. And I mentioned that last call as it wasn't incorporated into our guidance in a negative fashion. The way we look at it and the way we believe it works at least in our business is that customers will have a holiday budget and they will spend it between generally the middle of November. It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and for the shipping threshold cutoff. So, there's a polarization of tends to be a polarization to early shipping -- or excuse me early purchase and late purchases. As far as, the six days that sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we don't see an impact on that. Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and foot traffic, but we don't notice it in our business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. I just want to shift gears to grocery. I know you added Amazon Fresh into Prime kind of removing the previous $14.99 a month component there and putting it into Prime and you talked about the 2,000 U.S. cities and towns with two-hour delivery. Can you just talk about what the early impact there is of bundling kind of Fresh into Prime at this point? And then just how you're thinking about your grocery strategy as you're positioned now? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks for your question. So, early results are good. We -- our grocery delivery orders from the combination of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market more than doubled in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So, we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this. We wanted to take -- we will see where people's tastes and preferences will take them. We are -- whether they go to the store, the Whole Foods Market store, whether they use Prime Now or Amazon delivery for their groceries. Right now, we're really just testing and reacting to the customer demand and the customers' preferences and we'll do so for the foreseeable future. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks for including me. Then I'll throw off three quick ones. Just talk a little bit more about gross margins in the quarter. You had -- the year-over-year trend was negative last quarter, but it turned reverse and was up this quarter. So, if there are any unusual factors you'd want to call out there. Second the -- I don't want to read over a lot into your guidance, but every year for the last five years you've always guided to operating profit down sequentially and then you may be delivered better than that, but you always guided down. This year your high end of your range is actually above what you obviously did in the fourth quarter. Are you just trying to remind people, tell people, educate people on how the mix shift in the business towards AWS and advertising is just changing the profit profile of the business? So, any more color there? And then last one since Sunday is coming up. I know you talked about the AWS customers and you mentioned the Seattle Seahawks, but what about the 49ers? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Good luck 49ers. I'll get that out there first. Good luck Ken Sachse fan. We're indifferent. Let me start with your second one on -- sorry, the -- start with gross margin. Dave Fildes : Yes. So, I don't think there's anything too surprising caught there. I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business. You saw that accelerate some. We're continuing to see that trend of more FBA sellers signing and taking a larger percentage of the total 3P mix of units that are sold through, so that continues to do well. And as Brian mentioned earlier, we think some of that has to do with the program keeps getting better with faster shipping and whatnot. We've invested many billions of dollars in that program to make it even better for sellers. AWS had a strong quarter of course so that helps on the gross margin side as well. And then on transportation I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year. So, certainly up a good deal versus the trend line we saw in 2018. But of course that's reflective of one-day and overall relative to our expectations. As Brian said with the $1.5 billion we guided to it came in a bit under that. So some of that was certainly part of some better-than-expected trends efficiencies. Brian Olsavsky : And on the comment on seasonality of guidance and Q1 that -- I think the historic trend of peaking a bit in operating income in Q4 and then stepping down in Q1 has been broken up a little bit as we've had the balance of AWS and some other things. But if you actually look back to Q1 of last year, it was the highest operating income quarter on record. And that's one of the -- makes a difficult comp this year, because we had the -- if you remember the slowdown in expenditures in 2018 in things like fixed -- adding of headcount, warehouse space, infrastructure costs, not to zero, but like down off of prior investment levels in 2016 and 2017. A lot of that continued -- that cost baseline continued into Q1 of 2019 and it actually was a super-efficient quarter from a cost and profit standpoint. Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in one day. And so that's now something that is lapping in Q1 of this year because we didn't really have one-day in Q1 of last year. But -- so I think there's -- it's hard to draw those parallels between quarters anymore. I will though mention the guidance that we do have the $800 million of lower depreciation from our extension of our server useful lives, which is part of the range that we gave you of $3 billion to $4.2 billion. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

After the presentation we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead. Shelly Kay Pfeiffer : Hello and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO, Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you. It includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC. Including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration of the spread of the pandemic, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, work force staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures, our ability to continue operations in affected areas, and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the impact on suppliers creditors and third party sellers all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our business services and therefore, our actual results to differ materially from our guidance. And now I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past two months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it has also been a time of heroic action by healthcare workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time. I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen at Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand. Particularly for household staples and other essential products, across categories such as health, and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes, and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network. And with our seller community and our suppliers, what we generally have experienced getting ready for spikes in demand for known events, like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels, while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining six foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network. In our Whole Foods stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers, and reserve special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund, and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. We took steps to dampen demand for non-essential products, including reducing our marketing spend. Our network pivoted to shipping priority products within one to four days and extending promises on non-priority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores, with more than half of our units sold or from third-party sellers. We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60%, and expanded in store pickup at Whole Foods stores from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers and the overall effort to fight the COVID virus. AWS has created data lake to assist healthcare workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis, and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling video conferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example. Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC, with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance, and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels. How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID related costs in Q1, and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp up of new employees. Investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, our wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs, as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for non-essential items. While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time. With that, let's open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas Anmuth : First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID related incremental costs in Q2, you talk about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in Q2 and whether over time does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Doug, first on testing. So, we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we needed to test our scale of employees. So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to - and to again, we'll see how we do that differently and I don't know, you know again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is, is getting testing in the hands of our employees and then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas. On the spending, a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people cost, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I am only - we\u2019re only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months. And we'll continue to update this, but for now, most of what we see are temporary cost in the scheme of things, but certainly very expensive temporary costs. And also ones that we're not sure how long they'll last. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : I have two, Brian. The first one, is the current situation is, sort of I think, in many ways sort of showcase the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? And any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this? Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far in the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current [indiscernible] you've been going through? Brian Olsavsky : Well, I think we've learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or a Prime Day then it is to be ready for something like this when everything hits at once. High demand and also a need to restock automatically and prepare for it. So that's not something that we want to keep learning, but we're doing our best to maintain and provide key services for, and essential items for our Prime customers and all our Amazon customers. On the Prime program, what we're seeing is, again, you're seeing a lot of pickup in Prime shopping benefits. We see our prime customers are shopping more often and they have larger basket sizes. We're also seeing a lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits. So in March, for the first time viewers nearly doubled, which is I think a good time for people to when they're, a lot of them are staying at home to stay entertained. And you'll see our video collection. It's also beyond kind of Prime Video. It's also our channels and video rentals also went up, as I'm sure others in the entertainment business saw that as well. I think people are finding more benefit from Alexa when they're at home. They're listening to more music, asking questions, particularly questions related to COVID and issues around it. They're using it in education with their children. And I think we're seeing a lot more on the communication side using people using Alexa calling and drop in. So I think the Prime story is that shopping is, you know, really important for people now, especially when they, those people can't leave their houses. I think the digital benefits are scaling well. I think they are handling the additional demand, and it gives it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : First, could you just talk about where you are in terms of fulfillment efficiencies? The way you track it pre-COVID, Amazon was able to, had some sort of level of standard of meeting demand with within a certain period of time, how low that got given the surge in demand, and where you are in terms of the recovery? In other words, when are you going to be - how long will it take for Amazon to get back to a point where you'd have the same sort of service efficiency levels on the retail side that you had pre-COVID? How far are you away from that? And then the second one was, could you talk about the AWS business? And I guess I would have expected maybe the growth rates were really robust, but maybe even a kick up in the growth rate? What are you seeing there in terms of, I assume there is much greater usage of AWS now? Is that something that would show up in the P&L, maybe on a delayed basis? Just talk about what's happening to that side of the business in this crisis. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Well, we're happy with the growth in Q1on such a large base, again, we're, now it's $41 billion run rate, and that's 33% year-over-year. But what we're seeing post-COVID is, it varies by industry. I think what is probably where we're a bit well positioned is that we have such a breadth of customers, there's millions of active customers from start-ups, to enterprises, to public sector. So there's a lot of variance. And again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like videoconferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment all are seeing much higher growth and usage. And things like hospitality and travel certainly have contracted very severely, very quickly. So, I think there's going to be a mixed bag on industries, and of course this is will be tied to general economic conditions for the country and the world, quite frankly. So right now where we want to be there for our customers. We want to be able to scale up when they need us. We want to be there and support them regionally around the world. And we've been doing a good job at that, I believe. On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you were talking about one day, probably is the heart of your question, when we will get back to what we have seen and levels of one day. So a little bit on that. So again, as I mentioned in my introductory comments, we had to kind of absorb this shock of top line demand and also ability to stabilize our operations. We had to take the step to focus on essential items, extend the shipping period from one to four days, and then further on non-essential items. I had restrict things that were coming into the warehouses, and focus on the essential products. So we think that is still was the right course of action. And as we add capacity, we're trying to resume more normal operations as far as the shipping of non-essential items and the speeding up of one-day shipments. I will explain a bit on the one-day shipping cost, because it's aligned with this. So we originally thought we would spend $1 billion roughly on one-day shipping in Q1. And what we're seeing is, we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's - in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to ship things two-day, three-day, four-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment. But most of our one-day costs are really what we've done to our logistics networks to allow for one-day shipping. Things like putting inventory closer to the customer, things like building up our AMZL network and delivery network and also having multiple pull times and shipping windows during the day. So those are actually coming in, all those things are coming in very handy to us to help get more capacity out of what we currently have. And we're glad we've made that investment, but we don't actually see a savings because we're still shipping things once they're available very quickly to customers. So it's really a combination of how long it takes to get things in stock, picked, packed and shipped. The shipping is still pretty fast and is still coming quickly. It's taking longer to get things into our warehouse and out of our warehouse. So that's really the challenge right now is to speed that up, and that will, when we do that we'll see a resumption of more one-day service. But, right now things are still so up in the air that I can't really project when that day will be or what point in Q2 or Q3 or beyond. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry : I did want to dig just a little bit deeper into your comments on AWS. Yesterday, during Microsoft's call they had mentioned that they had seen two years worth of digital transformation in the cloud in two months. I'm curious if you, how you would characterize sort of what you have seen as we've gone into April in terms of cloud adoption and what this has meant for AWS, and the rate of adoption or acceleration in that business, maybe more broadly? And then as we look at the guidance, the $4 billion for the expenses in the second quarter. If we adjust for that implies a pretty material increase in profitability quarter over quarter. Any sense of, or any sense that you can sort of share with us just what the drivers behind that profitability is? How much of that is annualizing the one-day investments in the efficiencies that you're seeing there, versus anything else in particular that you would that you would call out? Brian Olsavsky : Yes, so first on AWS. I mean I don't have comments. You may have heard us talk about digital transformation. I think what I would say is, we've continue to see a healthy adoption of our business and healthy usage not only in the United States but globally. Our backlog of future contracts continues to build, and I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the most functionality, largest vibrant community of customers and partners having really proven operational and security experience. And building what customers need in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and other really key areas has not been impeded by this COVID crisis yet. And yes, we are seeing different performance in different industries. But our sales force is still there to help, help not only with current capacity, but also the transition to new, as people make that journey onto to the cloud. And then expand their use of the cloud. On the $4 billion, or sorry, on the Q2 guidance. I think the question is perhaps if how do we have a range that's above zero, if we have $4 billion of cost? Is that pretty much the essence of your question? I think there is - there are some efficiencies that would leverage that we get on fixed cost on higher volumes, even if they are somewhat breakeven on a contribution profit basis. There's some improvement in our cost structure when we have high volumes. There's also been a resumption of seller volume, especially from third parties using direct shipments to customers as companies are - you get more capability both in this country and other countries. We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have, again, very much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there and there's some products that are still out of stock. So it doesn't make sense to always do marketing, especially variable marketing in those situations. And we continue to, we believe we'll be saving travel and entertainment costs through the quarter. That's in, I would say in a couple of hundred million dollar size ranges on the cost. So there's a lot of moving parts here, but certainly the investment we're making in the COVID response is pretty significant. On the one-day, I would remind you that the one-day started in earnest Q2 of last year. So we're starting to lap that investment. It's not as large on a year-over-year basis as it's been in the past four quarters. And then the other thing that I would just point out is the - remember the impact of a change in the useful life of our servers, mostly hitting in the AWS business that was a $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1. And that will continue into the rest of the year. And that that again is the benefit we're seeing from being able to use our server and infrastructure assets for a longer time period. We've been working on the ability to run them longer, it's a hardware and a software challenge. And as we have had success there operating at scale for over 13 years now, we've been able to extend our useful life for assets, or recognized that we have been extending the life. So that's a benefit that we've seen in Q1, and we'll see it the remaining from here on out. Dave Fildes : Yes, just to add to that too, is I think about $800 million or nearly $100 million benefit in the first quarter, we do expect the change to the decrease as the year progresses some. Keep in mind. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two, if I can. One, on the demand of the revenue side, any difference in behavior you saw in various shelter in place geographies across the world, whether it be Europe versus in U.S. or Asia in the U.S. or India, in terms of consumer behavior or certain elements of adoption of certain product categories as we went through the month of March? Be curious for what differences you saw on a global scale, including on Prime adoption in response to COVID-19. And one quick one on the cost side of the equation, the cost of energy and oil have come down dramatically. Wanted to know if there was any way you would be able to call that out or an element of that in the overall cost structure as you do more of your own logistics over time. Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Sorry, Eric, I don't have much for you on the second point. Certainly we would look to see lower shipping costs. Although I would, but a lot of, I mean there's certainly things that we do long haul. There's things that we reposition, the airplanes. There's things that we do on long haul trucking, and that's where probably the fuel component would be larger. But we haven't quantified that, not for our guidance. I can't break it out for you right now. On how this may have played out differently in different geographies, we're actually seeing a lot of consistency, I would say in the types of products that people are buying in the state home restrictions. So it's been pretty consistent. There's obviously timing differences between countries, on one certain countries and when it's maybe ones where they are in their curve, and flattening the curve and all that. I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India, where of course, we similar to other companies in India, we're now only fulfilling our essential goods such as grocery. So that's cut back a lot on our offering, and we will further expand when the Indian government announces that were allowed to resume operations. So we're in a bit of a holding pattern except for grocery in India. And in France, there's been restrictions placed on us by the French courts. They did not impact Q1 business because essentially led to the closure of our French fulfillment centers in the middle of April. French customers are still able to order many millions of products from the selling partners we have who can ship directly to customers and through our global fulfillment. And we're continuing to appeal this court decision, but that's also different experience than the other countries internationally. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post : A couple, just wondering if you're seeing any sustainable changes in consumer habits you could call out, such as people converting to Prime at a more rapid rate, adding more products in the consumable categories to their subscribe and save, anything you see that could really signal a longer-term change in consumer habits, faster adoption of certain categories. And the second thing for the revenue guidance for 2Q, does that assume a slowdown in growth in May and June related to the crisis? Thank you. Dave Fildes : Justin, it's David. I think on some of the consumer behavior, I certainly point to grocery. If you look at the remainder of the online grocery is up in our online sales. So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores, but we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping and we have a number of ways for customers to do that. Prime Now, Fresh and then of course Whole Foods online for delivery or pick up. And really beginning in March and continuing now through April, seeing that increased demand so, that's continued. And a lot of our focus is on working around the clock and offering as much delivery as possible. We've increased delivery order capacity more than 60%, and our stores have gone up. Whole Foods stores that offer pick up capability has gone from roughly 80 stores before the events to more than 150, so a lot of work being done there. On the physical stores, which you can see the growth there. It increased year-over-year at about 8%. That is predominantly Whole Foods, but it's the Whole Foods in-store shopping experience, rather than the online order. So that's up quite a bit from the run rate you've seen in some recent quarters. It's again similar, saw lot of folks that were a stay at home measures were not yet in place where shopping in large volumes and stocking up at our stores. Since that time more recently, we have seen some of those growth rates for the in-store shopping moderate some. So a lot of work being done there, both in for the workers that are doing to delivery in the workers that are in the stores. A lot of focus on our part to make sure that they're safe and healthy, and able to accommodate customers make sure customers are comfortable, however they choose to shop. Brian Olsavsky : And I'd add to that. Justin, I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people customer to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through - music, video, Alexa, certainly communication features on our devices. We launched Prime Video Cinema in U.S., U.K. and Germany where movies are going direct to pay-per-view because of lack of theaters. And that was a good move by the team and that's been very well received. We've also made a lot of kids and family content available free to watch on Prime Video. So I think people are getting a better look at what's available with the Prime membership. Justin Post : And then, second half of the quarter, are you assuming, kind of, we go back to normal as the quarter progresses and some deceleration? Dave Fildes : Well we are heavily constrained, again it's an odd quarter because generally the biggest uncertainty we have this customer demand, and with the order and how much of it they'll order. Demand has been strong, the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that is the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find non-essential items, increasing marketing, and everything else. So I think the challenge is really on everything besides the top line. And top line is certainly not to be taken for granted. There's always the importance of having attractive offerings in stock for customers. But usually things you can count on, the cost structure, the ability to get products, yes, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually things that you can take for granted, and in this quarter, you can't. That's really where the uncertainty is driven. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju : So, Brian, I think the third-party unit mix de-indexed a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter. I know that number jumps around a little bit, but is this primarily a matter of constrained delivery resources? And, I guess, the heightened demand? And any sort of ongoing supply chain concerns that remain worrisome for you from either a first-party perspective or from what the third-party sellers may be calling out. Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that we use, but also that we sell to customers, things like masks. There's general availability, but still outages of things like cleaning wipes, masks, talk about testing, but that's not something that we sell. So there are a lot of supply chain concerns are mostly in those areas right now. I'm sorry, I forgot the other part of your question. Can you remind me what you just\u2026 Stephen Ju : The third-party unit mix de-indexing a little bit as a percentage of total this quarter. I'm just wondering if that's just normal fluctuations, or are you just prioritizing the first-party delivery against what's probably limited resources on the heightened demand. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that, yes, it's a little off during this period, because it's not so much we're restricting and favoring 1P or anything. It's we're prioritizing essential items, and a lot of those tend to be, especially in the consumable area tend to be retail supplied items from vendors. So I would say that is the reason that FBA would have not have been as high as it normally would be. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, and sellers are taking that opportunity ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse obviously. So it's a bit of a different type of 3P mix right now. We're trying to minimize the impact on FBA sellers as we open up our warehouse as well. Many of them are also MFN or direct shippers to our customers. So it's the ability to satisfy demand of our customers from our seller community has never been more important and we're very grateful to our third-party sellers. They've been through a lot as well. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. John Blackledge : On advertising, the other revenue growth line accelerated. Could you just discuss how the advertising business performed in the first quarter? And any color on how it's trending in the second quarter if possible. And then in the release you indicated more, potentially more, hiring above the 175,000 headcount additions, any way to quantify and does this hiring replace kind of the seasonal hiring that you typically do at the end of the third quarter? Thanks. Dave Fildes : Yes, sure. Let me start that second one, I don't have more for you on that. I think we'll announce as we change thresholds on hiring, we'll announce that at the time. Right now we've fully hired 175,000 people that we had discussed prior. 80,000 of them were in place at the end of the quarter. So the other 95,000 have been hired in April. On advertising what we've seen is it's been a very strong quarter in ad revenue. On your comment about other revenue accelerating, there's some other things going on in that other revenue account, the majority is revenue. But there's other, some other things, but I can tell you underneath that is that advertising growth rate has stayed consistent with last quarter. And we're very happy with the progression of that that offering for not only sellers, authors, vendors and positive impact it's had on customer selection. But we did start to see some impact. Yes. In March, some pullback from advertisers and some downward pressure on price, but how but advertising continues to advertise at a high cliff. It wasn't as noticeable maybe as with what some others are seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have again, as I said, downward pressure a bit on pricing. But I think we have a the large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which offsite which may have been disproportionately impacted at least early on here in the COVID crisis. And I think our advertising will prove to be very efficient as well. And it can be directly measured. So even as people are cutting back perhaps on advertising, or are their costs, I think this will be one area that will prove its value. It has in the past. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, David Fildes. Please go ahead. David Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, July 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to start by thanking and recognizing the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are working hard to serve our customers all around the world in these uncertain times. Amazon\u2019s second quarter was another highly unusual quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we began to see a significant increase in customer demand beginning in early March, and demand remained elevated throughout Q2. Strong early demand in groceries and consumable products continued into Q2, while demand increased during the quarter in our other major product categories like hardlines and softlines. At the same time, we continue to focus on stepped up employee safety, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations, to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. In Q2, we incurred more than $4 billion of COVID-related expenses, getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. The largest portion of these costs related to compensation for our frontline employees, including higher hourly wages through the end of May and a more than $500 million Thank You bonus in June. We also experienced productivity headwinds in our facilities. This included changes to over 150 of our processes to provide for social distancing as well as costs to onboard and train over 175,000 new employees who are hired to meet the higher customer demand. This $4 billion also included investments in personal protective equipment for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. Our consolidated revenue and operating income significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Strong top line performance was driven by increased consumer demand, led by Prime members. We continue to see high Prime member engagement throughout the quarter. Prime members shop more often with larger basket sizes. Worldwide streaming video hours doubled year-over-year driven largely by Prime video. We\u2019re reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. Online grocery sales tripled year-over-year. Existing Prime member renewal rates improved, and the Prime member growth rate accelerated both in the U.S. and worldwide. Our 3P sellers, who are largely comprised of small and medium-sized businesses, also stepped up to help make more selection available for customers. And as a result, these small and medium-sized businesses have seen significant growth in their sales. Our third-party seller services revenue grew faster than online stores revenue in Q2, with strong growth in both fulfillment by Amazon and merchant fulfilled or MFN seller sales. Third-party units continue to represent more than half of overall unit volume, helped by improved quarter-over-quarter growth in active sellers. We are more committed than ever to supporting the success of the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products in Amazon stores. We were able to meet this heightened demand because we were also able to open up more fulfillment network capacity as the quarter progressed with faster delivery across more selection. I\u2019d point to a few capacity improvements that have allowed us to enhance throughput. First, our regular headcount grew 34% year-over-year as of the end of Q2 and continues to grow. We welcomed more than 175,000 new employees in March and April, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. As we\u2019ve seen demand remain high, we are in the process of bringing 125,000 of these employees into regular full-time positions. I would also note that Amazon has created more jobs over the last decade than any other company, and we are proud that we\u2019re continuing to create good jobs with industry-leading wages and great benefits during this challenging time. Our combined number of regular and seasonal employees is currently over 1 million. We\u2019ve also been able to expand the output in our existing facilities as we\u2019ve had time to implement, learn and iterate on the new process paths we put in place. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 is typically our lightest volume quarter for the retail business. That\u2019s not the case this year, but what that\u2019s meant is that we can flex into space normally used for second half peak demand. This led to strong operating leverage in Q2. As we move towards peak in the second half of the year, we will ramp up our space needs even further, and we\u2019ll be adding significant fulfillment center and transportation capacity in the second half of the year. Turning to AWS. This is now a $43 billion annualized run rate business, up nearly $10 billion in run rate in the last 12 months. Customer usage remains strong, although growth varies across industries as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Lastly, I\u2019ll touch upon our Q3 guidance, which we provided as part of our earnings release. A few additional data points on this guidance. We expect to incur more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses in Q3 to help keep employees safe, including continued investment in social distancing, PP&E and testing. Costs are expected to be lower than in Q2 primarily due to better cost efficiency at the high demand levels we are seeing. In addition, I\u2019ll remind you that the third quarter is typically when we open the majority of our new fulfillment network capacity, and we expect the same this year. We continue to invest meaningfully, including $9.4 billion in CapEx and finance leases in Q2 alone, an increase of 65% year-over-year, primarily driven by investments in our fulfillment and logistics footprint. Once these buildings open, they are a headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak. In 2019, we increased network square footage by approximately 15%. This year, we expect a meaningfully higher year-over-year square footage growth of approximately 50%. This includes strong growth in new fulfillment center space as well as sort centers and delivery stations. We expect the majority of this capacity to come online in late Q3 and into Q4. Lastly, we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 this year rather than Q3 as it has been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host Prime Day on August 6 and August 7. In summary, we know that people are relying on online shopping more than ever during this unprecedented time, and we are working hard to add capacity to serve customers. We\u2019re extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A. Operator : At this time, we\u2019ll now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller, please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you\u2019re seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized non-essentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus non-essentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and two-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great. Thank you so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming non-essential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April. So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high. On the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much zero cost \u2013 or excuse me, zero profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We\u2019ve got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I\u2019d say, early part of May. So since then, I would say it\u2019s getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we\u2019re seeing on \u2013 it\u2019s driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They\u2019re shopping more often. They have larger basket sizes. There\u2019s still a heavy component of grocery \u2013 online grocery sales tripled year-over-year in the quarter as we added capacity there. So well, there\u2019s shifts in the mix based on what customers want. It\u2019s looking a little more normal, and it\u2019s staying at a very high level. On one day, we realize that our first priority is to keep our employees safe, and the second is focus on getting our capacity increased. Once we\u2019ve done that, we are working very hard to get faster shipments. And we\u2019ve seen the one-day and two-day recover through the quarter, but it\u2019s still probably considerably behind the going in rate before any of this happen. So we\u2019ll continue to work on that. But again, first priority is definitely keeping employees safe, and second is increasing our capacity. David Fildes : Yes. And this is just David. I think just from a geographic perspective, Brian\u2019s opening comments there, a lot of these order trends and activity, you can see that both the North America and the International segment are growing well. So a lot of those kind of trends in category performances and first-party and third-party seller growth, whether it be merchant fulfilled or FBA sellers, we\u2019re seeing a lot of growth across the board, kind of similar-type broad trends when you think about the U.S. and North America as well as our international regions, in particular, our more established international regions. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : Okay. So two, just a quick follow-up on Eric\u2019s question. Brian, when do you think you\u2019ll get back to par in terms of one day being one day? And then secondly, these profit levels are super high now. They\u2019re becoming super high at the company if you ex out the COVID costs. Is Jeff aware of how profitable the company is becoming? Is he happy about it? And I\u2019m kind of being facetious, obviously, when I asked that. But what I also want to ask really is when you think about new investment areas, and at the top of the list, maybe some new international launches are really building out some of the markets that you\u2019ve \u2013 like India, Brazil and Mexico or the business-to-business operations, like there\u2019s a ton of new investment areas, and it seems like the Amazon historically, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same now, would be using this kind of revenue surge and really investing aggressively in these new areas. So just talk about that. I know you\u2019ve got spend on COVID, but as you think about the next three to five years, you\u2019ve got these really profit surges. How can you deploy those? Or how do you want to deploy those into some of the newer investment areas? Thanks a lot. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks for your questions, Mark. First, on when we get back to par, we don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019re getting progressively better, but we\u2019re also balancing what is going to be very stepped up demand and capacity in Q3 and Q4. So if you look at our historic run rates and can see how big a quarter Q2 was, Q2 was actually higher revenue than Q4 of last year, which is unheard of. And Q3 is now forecast to be also higher than Q4 of last year. So we\u2019ve kind of moved the peak forward, and for different reasons, we\u2019re trying to, mainly, like as I said, first priority is getting \u2013 is making sure our employees are safe and that we continue to do social distancing and keep everybody safe and healthy. Second priority is getting capacity online because we do not have \u2013 in Q2, we generally have lower revenue. And in Q2, like I mentioned, we were able to use the excess capacity that did exist to serve the higher demand. Now as we move into Q3, we\u2019re starting to \u2013 we need to build the inventory more for Q4, and we\u2019ve run out of space. So we\u2019ve got our hands full on that challenge, but we\u2019ve got a really good team that\u2019s been working very hard probably since late February on this issue. And when you talk about profitability, we\u2019ll also mention that there are a couple of expenses that have gone down in the interim. Marketing, we cut marketing probably by about 1/3 in Q2 as \u2013 mainly because we\u2019re trying to manage demand. It started to normalize and get back to somewhat normal levels in \u2013 at the end of Q2, but \u2013 and therefore, we\u2019ll see a higher level in Q3. But certainly, marketing costs were lower. You probably saw it in a lot of companies. Travel expenses have almost drawn to a halt. Meeting costs, even medical costs in some examples or in some cases have been delayed as people don\u2019t go to the doctor or don\u2019t go there as quickly. We think that will normalize over time. And as far as investments, we\u2019ve got a lot of investments already in play. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of necessarily accelerating investment or \u2013 we\u2019re always looking for new investments that make sense to us. But during this time, I would say we\u2019ve actually accelerated our ops investment. We pulled in capacity that we probably didn\u2019t think would be needed until 2021, maybe later. On grocery, we\u2019ve also greatly expanded our grocery delivery capacity, and that\u2019s probably ahead of schedule. David Fildes : Yes. This is Dave. Just to add to that, I think Prime is such a big focus, and some of the growth statements that Brian talked about at the opening of the call, whether it was strength in Prime membership and the acceleration we saw in the U.S. or worldwide or some of the usage stats like the grocery momentum or the doubling of video hours, for us, it\u2019s just another encouraging sign. We think there\u2019s still a lot more value we can add to that program. And that\u2019s not just in the United States where we\u2019ve got sort of a broader set of services than some of the other regions, but really focusing on supporting in some of those other regions. And so we\u2019ve got places like Australia, the Middle East. We\u2019ve talked about India many times, but a lot of focus on building that out. I think what\u2019s great about a place \u2013 all geographies with a place like India is we\u2019re really focused on digitizing the Indian sellers. A lot of micro, small and medium-sized businesses there. We launched some new features there to help support the digitization efforts with some of those brands and just a lot of work, great work being done by that team. They have some goals there around getting more sellers on board and hiring many more people as well. So a lot of focus there. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, Brian, is going back to the investments, and you\u2019re often making multiyear investments for customers and customer offerings, and you\u2019re the man behind the capital allocation plan. I guess I\u2019d be curious to hear about can you give us some examples of areas of investment that may have been pushed out this year because of shelter in place and the higher demand that you\u2019ve been seeing? So what were areas where you thought you were going to spend more at the start of the year than you actually have now in the current 2020 plan? And then the second one, the international strength, I appreciate the color on Europe and Japan. Nice to see the profitability. Maybe just talk to us sort of qualitatively about some puts and takes around your core international markets, Europe and Japan? And how to think about whether or not they could be more or less profitable than the U.S. long-term? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. I think you\u2019ll \u2013 starting with that second one. You\u2019ll notice that the International segment was profitable this quarter, and that\u2019s a great sign. It is heavily driven by the pickup in demand that we saw, as I mentioned, I believe, in multiple calls. What\u2019s going on internationally is we have some very healthy established countries that we\u2019ve been in a long time. And we have probably accelerated their adoption of Prime benefits. We\u2019ve pushed video and devices and music and other things to those countries probably earlier in the life cycle than you would have seen in the U.S. So there\u2019s a bit of a forward investment on Prime benefits in many of those countries. But what you also see are investments in new countries. Obviously, India is the biggest one, but also, to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Brazil, Turkey and Australia are recent addition. So there\u2019s always an element of expansion going on there. Advertising is growing, so that\u2019s a good source of profitability. But if you look at what happened in Q2, it was essentially just the much higher volumes than we had anticipated or had on a run rate. So our fixed costs were leveraged to the hilt. Obviously, we will add some capacity and things in transportation and fulfillment centers, but all other fixed costs were pretty much leveraged on that higher demand. The UK in particular, was very strong because there\u2019s probably more stay-at-home orders and the way the economy was developing in the UK. We had a very, very strong quarter there. So I would say that the surge in demand internationally also helped drive that profitable, maybe a little earlier than the trajectory would have shown. And I\u2019m not sure that, that is going to continue for the next couple of quarters, but it\u2019s a good sign that we could leverage that. And a lot of the same trends in the U.S. were apparent internationally, higher Prime \u2013 more frequent Prime purchases and higher basket sizes. So all good signs, and perhaps we got a glimpse of the future on the demand curve. Your second question on slowing investments. The list is very short on what we\u2019ve had to slow down. It\u2019s mostly \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been done necessarily for cost reasons, it\u2019s been done for people reasons. The one I\u2019d point to is studios. We\u2019ve had to delay production. I think most studios have. And that\u2019s been augmented by some new things like our Amazon cinema where we\u2019re having first run movies. And so I think in this time, when people want entertainment, people are having trouble creating new content across the board. And that\u2019s a bit of a challenge, but it\u2019s not something we\u2019re doing intentionally. We\u2019re doing it to protect the actors and film crews, and we think that\u2019s the right decision. As I said, a lot of the investments are being pulled in, especially on the upside and grocery delivery, same-store pickup. A number of whole food stores that you can pick up deliveries on tripled this quarter. So the list is short on things that we\u2019re slowing down on, I would say. It\u2019s just we\u2019re adapting and probably looking at whether some things have changed and creating some things for the new environment, especially in the entertainment area. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. Brian, first, just curious about your overall thoughts on how the e-commerce adoption curve has been shifted here over the next few years. And anything you can share around behavior for new and existing customers. And then separately, on AWS, the $43 billion run rate obviously slowed some in the quarter, but hoping you could comment just on the pace of IT decision-making in this environment, whether you\u2019re still impacted by some clients more highly exposed to challenged verticals? And due to those factors, is it possible that AWS can accelerate growth going forward? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Let me start with that second one. Thanks, Doug. So in the AWS segment revenue, what we see are companies are working really hard right now to cut expenses, especially in the more challenged businesses like hospitality and travel but pretty much across the board. We\u2019re helping them. We\u2019re actively, with our sales force, looking for ways that we can help them save money. This includes things like scaling down the usage where it makes sense or benchmarking their workloads against our architectural best practices. So that\u2019s not going to help our usage growth in the short run, but it will help those customers save money. And we think that\u2019s the right thing to do, not only for their success and so they can come out of this at a better shape but also for the long-term health of our relationship with them as an AWS provider. But we\u2019re also seeing a lot of companies that are really wishing that they had made more progress on the cloud because they\u2019re seeing how companies that are on the cloud can turn into a variable cost and either scale up or scale down depending on their particular situation. They realize their on-premise infrastructure is not really flexible to go up or down. And especially in the time of sinking demand, it\u2019s a big fixed cost for them. So we expect \u2013 we\u2019re seeing migration plans accelerate. They\u2019re certainly not going to happen overnight, but we see companies moving more in that direction. We think that will be a good long-term trend. And there\u2019s certainly winners in this area right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning and entertainment. All are seeing usage growth. And it\u2019s a bifurcated world out there. So the \u2013 on your e-commerce adoption, I think it\u2019s hard to tell. We\u2019re super encouraged by the fact that grocery delivery has picked up, and that\u2019s been accelerated versus what we would have thought. We certainly are glad to be there for our Prime members who are shopping more frequently and buying more. We do know that there\u2019s reasons that there are other options are limited. I mean there are always retail options out there, especially to go pick up in store, but less people want to go into stores perhaps now. So we\u2019re going to have to see what is maybe a step-up in the curve and getting to a point quicker versus what are some onetime sales and things like \u2013 hopefully, things like masks and gloves and cleaning supplies in the fullness of time become onetime purchases, but we\u2019ll see. And sorry, your last point was on new customers versus existing customers. We\u2019re seeing similar trends. We\u2019re seeing good pickup in frequency and basket size for new members in Prime as well, certainly not the same as people have been Prime members for a number of years. But it\u2019s encouraging. And as you saw, Prime growth retention has increased. We\u2019ve accelerated the number of \u2013 the growth of Prime members, both in the U.S. and internationally. So that\u2019s a good sign that we\u2019re happy about. And we hope that, that has long-term ramifications. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ross Sandler : Yes. Just a follow-up to that last comment. So the Prime behavior for international Prime members, you guys have talked about how like in the 16, 17 countries, the overall service levels are a little bit behind, selection is a little bit behind. So has the last few months in the pandemic closed that gap meaningfully in terms of GMV per Prime member for international versus what you see in the U.S.? Any comment there? And then on the 3Q guidance, you pushed Prime day for western markets into 4Q. So how much of the deceleration \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a really strong number for 3Q, but the growth rate is decelerating a little bit. Is that mostly from Prime Day? Or can you just talk about what kind of behaviors you\u2019re seeing right now as you go into 3Q? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Right. Well, we ramped up through the quarter in Q2 and ended up with 41% year-over-year growth in FX-neutral \u2013 on an FX-neutral basis. A lot of those trends are continuing into Q3. You see our revenue range is $87 billion to $93 billion coming off of $89 billion quarter. So I would say that the \u2013 if you look at the growth rate, that translates into somewhere in the 24% to 33% growth rate in Q3. So I can\u2019t break out exactly the Prime impact because there\u2019s \u2013 but suffice to say, it\u2019s a big driver on why 41% growth in Q2 turns into 24% to 33% growth in Q3 on what turns out to be higher revenue volume. And then on Prime behavior, it\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t really give you more on that because it is actually a very localized set of staff by country. In international, aggregate does not matter that much. And what I would say is, generally, what we\u2019re seeing is similar trends in international in response to COVID purchasing patterns. I wouldn\u2019t say it closed the gap. I said \u2013 I would say they both went up. And we\u2019ll see how it goes from there. I think there\u2019s definitely any differences in selection or differences in shipping. There\u2019s a myriad of factors that go into a Prime member\u2019s decision to be a Prime member and to what they buy and what they use as far as our benefits that we give them. So I don\u2019t want to make too many sweeping comments on that right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brent Thill : Thanks, good afternoon. I was curious if you could just expand on AWS. There was a little bit of a slowdown across the board and a number of the cloud numbers. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s a common trend that you\u2019re seeing there. And perhaps just talk about the backlog. I know you\u2019ve disclosed the backlog has been improving in the filings, but a little more color on AWS would be certainly helpful. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, sure. I\u2019ll give you the backlog number. It grew 65% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter. So that\u2019s healthy, and we have the average contract length is over three years for our AWS contracts. I would say contract volume and negotiations are strong and have maintained through this period. So it is \u2013 that\u2019s a good sign. It really does boil down to short-term versus long-term incentives here for a lot of our customers. They\u2019re \u2013 if you\u2019re in an industry that\u2019s been heavily impacted by COVID in the economy, you\u2019re looking for ways to save money and you\u2019re trying to do a click and we\u2019re trying to help in that regard. And one of the best ways to save money long-term is to use the cloud, not only to turn it into a variable cost, it could be a fixed cost, but also to be able to take advantage of the partner network that we have, the security that we have and also the constant evolution of products and services that we bring to market. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Aaron Kessler : Great. A couple of questions. First, maybe just one of your competitors noted that growth was slowing in some markets that have opened up, I guess, probably more in Europe. Maybe just thoughts there. Are you seeing any changes in sort of the markets that are starting to open up? And just any commentary on the Zoox acquisition, how you kind of \u2013 can use that technology longer term as well? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : I imagine you mean on consumer business, countries opening up. Aaron Kessler : Correct. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Well, we still see strong demand. So I don\u2019t have any particular color on that regard by country. We do think probably the UK was very \u2013 grew very strongly in Q2, and that, I believe, is starting to moderate a bit but still stronger than normal. So I don\u2019t want to go by country, but I think those trends will start to perhaps become evident. But the \u2013 from our vantage point, the Prime members still continue to order more frequently and in larger basket sizes. David Fildes : Yes. And then, Aaron, just on your second question on Zoox, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s not too much to say at this point. It\u2019s still pretty early, but I think it probably goes without saying it\u2019s a tremendously forward-thinking team, which resonates with us. And they really do kind of pioneer in that space, the ride-hailing space. So a lot of cool work they\u2019re doing, designing autonomous vehicles and focused on the passenger, right, in front of mind in that. So I think, again, just as we think about kind of the innovation components and commitments to solving kind of problems and challenges for customers, it\u2019s pretty exciting for us to be able to work with them and bring that vision to fruition in the years ahead. Operator : Our final question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post : Great. A couple of questions. Obviously, a great cost quarter on the leverage side. Any changes in e-commerce gross margins to call out? Is scale and getting size, improving gross margins or anything on the mix shift there that\u2019s interesting? And then secondly, we talked about a lot about one day investment last year. Obviously, the shipping times were impacted by COVID, but are you back to kind of normal times? And where are you on the one day investment? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. On one day, again, we\u2019re first prioritizing employee safety. We have a lot of effort in that regard. We\u2019ve changed over 150 process paths. We\u2019ve instituted social distancing, cleaning, temperature taking, both with our warehouse employees and also our transportation employees. So that\u2019s really still priority one. And second is capacity expansion, especially as we head into the second half of the year, which generally sees a step-up in volume even over the first half of the year. So we will \u2013 we are improving the percentage of one day. We\u2019re not back to where we were pre-COVID. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be back in the short run, but we will continue to improve it. And hopefully, it\u2019ll be less noticeable for our consumer base. On the gross margin side, it\u2019s very much a mixed bag right now. There\u2019s \u2013 before the COVID outbreak, the positives were generally AMZL costs \u2013 delivery costs were becoming more efficient. Advertising was \u2013 and AWS were certainly a strong component of gross margin increases. Product mix could go either way depending on the country. But as this COVID has played out, consumables and grocery, which are lower margin, have started to \u2013 have been a negative impact on gross margin. But the \u2013 we feel good about where we are. Gross margin for the quarter was 40.8% and was down 200 basis points from last year. It\u2019s probably more tied to the addition of one-day shipping. And even if we didn\u2019t do as much one-day shipping as we\u2019ve been doing post COVID, the costs of one-day shipping are already built into our structure. We\u2019ve already reconfigured our network. We\u2019ve already created the capacity to be able to ship. It\u2019s just a matter of whether or not we can get it out through the warehouse and to you in one day or not. David Fildes : Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Head of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello and welcome to our Q3 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 29, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by extending a big thank you to all the folks who worked hard to make this year's Prime Day a great success, not only for our more than 150 million Prime members around the world. But also for the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who sell on our Amazon store many of whom are facing their own challenges during this pandemic. These businesses thrived on Prime Day. With third-party sellers recognizing more than $3.5 billion in sales over the two-day global event, that's 60% increase compared to Prime Day last year. I also want to thank and recognize the contributions of more than one million Amazon employees and delivery partners who are continuing to work hard to serve our customers all around the world, who will continue to spend what it takes to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. Now let me share some highlights from the quarter. Our Q3 results largely reflect a continuation of demand trends we saw when we exited the second quarter. The strong demand in sales growth across our major product categories globally including hardlines, consumables, softlines and media. We also continue to see strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. They continue to expand their usage of Prime's digital benefits including Prime video. Internationally, the number of Prime members who stream Prime video grew by more than 80% year-over-year in the third quarter and international customers more than doubled the hours of content they watched on Prime video compared to last year. We're also reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q3, our year-over-year growth rate of online grocery sales continued to accelerate and we continue to offer more convenient options for customers including grocery pick up which is now available from all Whole Foods Market stores. And just as we saw in Q2, Prime member renewal rates improved in Q3 year-over-year. 3P sellers who as I mentioned are largely comprised of small and medium sized business continue to be important part of our offering to customers. Our 3P sellers services revenue continue to grow faster than online stores revenue. With particularly strong growth this quarter in FBA, as we return to similar mix of FBA as a percentage of total 3P units as we've seen prior to COVID. 3P units continue to represent over half of overall unit volume increasing to 54% of the total unit mix in Q3. We're investing heavily to support sellers and are pleased to report that over half a million sellers are seeing record sales in our stores this year. We continue to focus on stepped up employees safety particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations. To help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners as well as the employees and customers shopping at our Whole Foods Market and other stores. This of course has added incremental cost to our P&L. The largest portion of these costs relate to continue productivity headwinds in our facilities including process revisions to allow for social distancing and incremental cost to ramp up new facilities and the large influx of new employees hired to support strong customer demand. This also includes investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning of our facilities. In total, we've incurred more than $7.5 billion in incremental COVID related costs in the first three quarters of 2020 and we expect to incur approximately $4 billion in Q4. Our consolidated revenue and operating income exceeded the top end of our guidance range. As demand remains strong in the quarter the extra volume and operating leverage helped us to achieve higher than expected profitability. And we saw another strong quarter of revenue growth in operating income performance in AWS and advertising. We had good leverage with our fulfillment centers as well as in Amazon logistics, our transportation network despite the higher COVID related cost that I mentioned. Although we had strong growth in our network in Q3 some of our fulfillment network expansion shifted out a few weeks thought it happened in Q4 rather than Q3. Once new buildings open, their short-term headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak. More of this headwind will be felt in Q4 rather than in Q3 and this is reflected in our Q4 guidance. We were able to meet the heightened demand in Q3 because we opened up more network capacity particularly in our transportation network. I pointed two important drivers of this. First, we hired a lot more people to support the strong customer demand. We welcomed 250,000 permanent full time and part time employees just in Q3 and have already added about 100,000 more in the first month of Q4. I will note that these are permanent jobs with industry leading pay including Amazon's $15 minimum wage and great benefits such as health insurance, 401(k) plan and parental leave. Secondly, this has been a big year for capital investments. We've invested nearly $30 billion in CapEx and finance leases through the first nine months of 2020 including over $12 billion in Q3. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our fulfillment and logistics network square footage by approximately 50% this year which includes significant additions to our fulfillment centers as well as our transportation facilities. Majority of these buildings open in late Q3 and into Q4. About half of this square footage growth will be on the transportation side to be opening more sort centers and delivery stations. And finally, in AWS customer usage remained strong. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. While we're busy gearing up for our Annual re :Invent Conference. This year reinvent will be a free three-week virtual conference running from November 30th through December 18th. We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon who have delivered on unprecedented demand for several months now as well as a strong Prime Day in October. We're ready to go and looking forward to meeting the needs of our customers this holiday season. With that, let's move onto Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I've two Brian. The first one you mentioned the fulfillment center saw good leverage in the quarter. Can you just talk to us about some of the qualitative drivers of this improvement you're seeing in fulfillment cost per fulfilled unit in the quarter and sort of year-to-date and how to think about the durability of that overtime? And then secondly, I think throughout the summer Amazon logistics launched the third-party delivery service in the UK. I'm curious just to hear about early learnings from that product and how you think about scaling that to other countries and maybe globally? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Brian. Thanks for your question. Yes, the fulfillment center cost is going to be a blend of part of the COVID related cost that I mentioned in and itemized. Offset by some really strong leverage, I would say that we've been running very consistently high levels really since all of our employees came back in the first or second week of May and some of them been on unpaid leave. So that demand is very consistent and strong and has created a lot of favorable leverage because again the order pattern being high and consistent as leveraging our fixed cost assets. Things like our delivery routes are more dense at high volumes. So we see even transportation some increased efficiencies. Offsetting that again is productivity elements that we've articulated things like social distancing, extended breaks. Other steps we're taking to keep people safe and distanced in our facilities, in our delivery network. Dave Fildes : And this is Dave, I don't have much to share I think on, what we've got going on with any of [indiscernible] efforts other than I'll just say, we're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support. The companies we work with including small and medium-sized businesses we sell on Amazon and that includes testing and shipping programs that can help any of these businesses gets packages to customers quickly and reliably. Brian Nowak : Great, thank you both. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Brian just wanted to go back to the 4Q operating income guide. I appreciate your thoughts there. Just trying a dig a little bit deeper in terms of how you're thinking about it kind of beyond the $4 billion in COVID cost. It still feels like maybe there's some more in there that we're not thinking about perhaps beyond the square footage increases and the incremental headcount. So if you've any comments there? And just curious I know it's early on 2021, but you've obviously done a ton of investment this year and with the 50% square footage increase and you tend to cycle at times in terms of CapEx investment. Just how you think about [adjusting] [ph] that kind of build out as you go forward? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Doug. One last comment, I forgot to mention to Brian on his last question is, the fact that a lot of that heightened demand so far coming to Q2 and Q3 when we tend to have excess capacity before Q4, so that's another source of leverage especially in non-peak orders. As far as guidance is concerned again, I think there's lot of uncertainty certainly in Q4. We generally have a lot of uncertainty around the holiday things from holiday spending to what our cost to fulfill normal orders would be whether issues that can come up this year's an election year. We saw some disruption in 2016, so there's a whole host of issues that generally come to bear in Q4. I think the fact that COVID is dwarfing all of those is causing us a lot of uncertainty on our top line range. We saw continuation in Q3 of some really good trends from Q2 and we've project those into Q4. Some of the negative factors that you mentioned as foreign profitability is again. We'll see more of the brunt of the capital investment and the people investment. We had a lot of people in the last quarter and then we added another 100,000 people in October so far. So there's that, there's generally the dynamics of Prime Day because it's a deal-oriented time period that's usually not the highest margin period and that shifted into Q4. But generally, we have really because of the calendar this year we have really built our capacity included both in facilities and people and are carrying it through the entire quarter. We carried it through Prime Day and now we're carrying it through into the rest of the quarter. I think in other quarters you might have seen more gradual build up that would have occurred through October end and probably maximized in November and December. So that's what I would tell you on holiday again. We have our normal caveats, so there's a lot of uncertainty and things that could go right and wrong, so that's why we put a range around it. And I'm sorry, could you repeat your second question? Doug Anmuth : Just on how you think about 2021 perhaps just CapEx build out going forward given that you've really stepped up the investment in 2020? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. I think some of the investment things like grocery delivery and that capacity are things that we would have invested in over time and it being matched by higher order volume. So our intent is to continue to deliver a great grocery delivery experience for our customers. So that is a little bit of pull forward. Yes, we did expect to build out our logistics capacity a lot this year especially as we have been rolling out one-day delivery the middle of last year, that was setting us up for a big build this year. So we pull forward a bit from 2021 into this year to satisfy the demand. I think we've - the logistics team is really good at in one way you're locking up long-term commitments on space and buildings. But on the other hand being able to adjust the timeline in or out to match the capacity and demand. I think at this point we're not trying to cut it close and we're erring on the side of having too much capacity and we think that's the right call. It has been this year. We'll adjust as we get through the holiday and we'll learn a lot more. Hopefully the pandemic will be in better shape as a country and globe in Q1 of next year. It's very reactionary at this point. We've got to play the hand that we're dealt and we're trying to anticipate and keep the customer insulated from any variability. But it's challenging certainly. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for the color Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post : Great, thanks. When you look at 3Q the environment, can you help us kind of understand the best you can quantify. How much of the incremental unit sales do you think are being aided by COVID or how much is it just a natural recurring shift online that could recur and continue to grow next year? Any thoughts on that? And then same type of question for the cloud? I'm guessing there's some headwinds of lower transaction volumes for some of your customers and then maybe there's more demand from the work at home environment. So if you could give us any thoughts on both the retail and cloud and how COVID is impacting it and could there be - how that will impact next year? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. It's hard to predict. I would say that there's been phases of this year. Early on there were a lot of stock ups of groceries and other household supplies followed by a wave of people buying gloves and disinfectant wipes and masks. That maybe a bit of bubble that people are not going to buy as much next year hopefully that will be a good problem to have it, as that demand went down. But otherwise we're seeing Prime number engagements. So it's strengthening our Prime program. The renewal rates are going up and the engagement is going up. So people are buying more frequently and across more categories. They're using more of our digital benefit. We like the trends on kind of connectedness to our Prime program and we think that will have lasting value. When things open up a bit more and there's more store options for people to buy from, there will be leveling of volume back to the stores I would imagine. So we think the trends are good. They've been pulled forward probably a bit from our - the adoption curves have been pulled forward from our initial - pre-COVID thinking especially on things like grocery delivery. So your second question on the cloud. Cloud is a mixed bag right now because we're very happy with the cloud performance and we're seeing a lot of customers who are now moving to the cloud at a faster pace. It accelerated their plans. There's anomalies in different industries going on this year things like travel and hospitality are down. A lot of companies are in holding pattern in middle and some are doing really well things like video conferencing, and gaming, and remote learning, and things tied to entertainment. So I would say that majority of the companies though are looking for ways to cut down on expenses. Going to cloud is a good way to cut down on expenses long-term. To trying to cut down on their short-term costs in the cloud, by tuning their workloads and we're helping them do that and doing the best we can to help them save short-term dollars and again tune their usage again some of our benchmark. We think that is good for the customer and therefore, it will be good for us long-term. But even and despite those actions with strong growth the year-over-year growth in absolute dollars this quarter were the largest we've ever seen and we feel good about the state of the business and the state of our sales force and their ability to drive value during this period. We've seen a lot of companies extending their contracts with us. The backlog of multi-year deals has gone up quite a bit. It's good from a customer connectedness standpoint. Certainly each industry is going through different dynamics right now. Dave Fildes : And you can see, this is Dave. I'll just add to that. You can see number of those significant commitments of customers called in [indiscernible] carriers, global payments and number of others. Also seeing some good engagement with governments on their recognizing need to transform tech, get their technology more nimble and innovative. Schools and universities are planning for online learning. So a lot of help we can work with customers to provide there. On the kind of from a product perspective, we're seeing significant momentum with our AWS design Graviton2 processors. So you've got customers like SmugMug and Netflix and there's many others. But they're realizing up to 40% better price performance from the newer Amazon EC2s, the MRC T [ph] instance families. So when you compare that to x86-based instances. Those Amazon EC2 instance families are all powered by our - with our new AWS design Graviton2 processors. So really pleased with what we're seeing there in that engagement as well. Operator : Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. Just a couple of things, how should we think about where capacity utilization of the fulfillment infrastructure is at this point with the way the growth that we've seen and the wave of new warehouse announcement? What kind of CapEx is going to be necessary to sort of bring you back to what you would consider normal levels that you'd be growing from? And then there's obviously been a lot of discussion around the capacity limitation the third-party shipping networks are going to see this holiday season given demand. How much of an issue do you see that as being and given your investments and your own delivery capacity does that become a competitive advantage for you during the holiday? Brian Olsavsky : Yes, thanks Health. I'll start with that last one yes. [Indiscernible] intertwined here so. The third-party shipping, we rely on third-party shippers. We've great partnerships around the globe with third-party shippers and we know that their capacity will be tight as well as ours. We do feel good that we've invested quite a bit in our own capacity and you just mentioned that, about half of our CapEx is going to expanding transportation. A lot of the people that we're hiring are also focused on transportation. So we feel good that we've been able to develop that capability a lot of this year because we needed it and we're going to need it in Q4. Having said that, it's going to be tight for everyone and I think it will all be stretched and it's advantageous to the customer and probably to the companies for people to order early this year. But regardless of the order pattern we're going to do our best to get the usual excellent service to our customers. On CapEx levels, again we've grown our fulfillment and logistics infrastructure 50% this year. We'll see again what that implies for next year. We do see continued expansion and CapEx specifically in transportation area. So that will be start of probably multi-year period where we're hiring CapEx for that. But we'll see, right now we're just focused on Q4 and giving the guidance for Q4. Your question on capacity utilization. It's been very tight this year certainly we're able to fill up a lot of our any excess capacity in Q2 and Q3 that might have seasonally been excess. As we get into Q4 and everything stepping up. We're adding it and using it simultaneously. We had a really good test for Prime Day and we feel good about that performance in that work and we continue to add on top of that. Lots of excitement around the holiday. But we feel we're in good shape and ready to go. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : Thanks, two questions please. How should we think about these $4 billion expenses in the fourth quarter, $7 billion year-to-date like? Do you view them more as one-time-ish or just overall increases as you built out the network? Are they structural or one-time-ish I really want to get at that? Secondly international segments been nicely profitable or reasonably profitable for two quarters in a row. Is there some reason to think that's sustainable? And I'm sorry, third question. The other revenue growth accelerated to 49% can you give any color behind that? Thanks a lot. Brian Olsavsky : Hi Mark, thank you. Let me start with the COVID question. So we have again, our expenses in Q3 were estimated to be around $2.5 billion and we're seeing closer to $4 billion in Q4. The majority of that is due to the expansion of our operations. So things like productivity that. There's productivity drags for things like new hire ramp, social distancing, extending break periods, things that we can quantify, said look this is a change in our process that has hurt productivity. We also have cost related to - so those are calculated that. There's more direct cost around cleaning and supplies, testing and those are the main things I would say. So what we're trying to do by capturing these cost as to show what is, we believe is incremental and the intent is that these for our own knowledge as well that these will once the pandemic is over hopefully that soon, that these should be cost that don't recur. Okay. We know that simultaneously there's some benefits going on right now. There's things like in Q2 we had lower marketing expense you see that in our trends. It's starting to come back in Q3 and Q4 to more normalized levels but certainly everyone. There's not a lot of requirement or need to do marketing this year for parts of the year. We saved nearly $1 billion in travel this year because travel's ground to a halt, internal travel, travel on expenses. So there's things like that will resume at a later date and maybe not get to the same levels as the past. But there won't be as artificially low as this year. So we're trying to be transparent as best we can on the cost we're seeing. We're [indiscernible] netting against some of the favorability's from demand and some of the other cost that might be offsetting although they're not offsetting to the extent that they COVID costs are sitting there. And then I'll point the fact that because we're running at such a high level and at consistently high level really in off peak periods. We have been able to run these warehouses very efficiently. You have to split the discussion kind of between the cost penalty on the COVID related issues. But then there's certainly been some favorability from running assets more fallout condition. Okay, so hopefully that gives you some color on it. International segment profitability. I would say and I think we discussed this a bit last quarter. We're seeing an advancement of volume and very strong volume if you will in especially in our countries in Europe and Japan. So we maybe putting in a way future volume onto this year's cost structure. So that is probably why you're starting to see that is why you're seeing profitability in international. I would say generally we're still investing ahead of the US in a lot of dimensions internationally things like Prime benefits, things like the devices, things like international expansions. You might have seen that we just launched in Sweden yesterday. There's a lot of competing factors going on right now internationally. But I think right because of the high volumes and the leverage we're seeing and particularly in places like the UK and Germany it creating profitability ahead of schedule if you will. But we should get about the level of investment that continued and we see that we're committed to continuing that even after the pandemic and including the international segment of course is India where we've had a very strong Prime Day and Diwali is off to a good start and so anyway. The third comment was on other revenue. Yes that is essentially getting mostly advertising and we had very strong advertising performance in Q3. So continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2. We start to see advertising budgets increase from some of the contraction that had occurred earlier in Q2 and we just had a lot more traffic and we do a good job of turning that traffic into valuable real estate for our advertisers and for our customers to find out more about selection and brand discovery. So most of that is with strong quarter in advertising and that's what you're seeing in the other revenue line. Operator : Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One following up on Mark's question on the advertising side. You know we continue to see you guys innovate a lot on the product side especially with programmatic advertising, video advertising. Can you just give us a little bit of sense of how you see the advertising offering both on Amazon and off Amazon sort of evolving in the years ahead? And the second question would be coming back Brian to your comment in the opening remarks around Prime video and all the consumptions you've seen globally in the recent past. How does that help inform what do you think about in terms of the opportunity when invest against original content to continue to drive that sort of medium consumption loop within the Prime membership. Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, great. Eric I'll start off with the questions on advertising. So just to ground you and I think our main priorities here at the space and some of these probably aren't too surprising is, we're focused on making our tools easier to use. Sponsored ads, sponsored brand site, a bidding sponsored product targeting. Working on just simplifying registration for agencies and marketers, getting set up. But we're also very focused on being smarter about servicing more relevant ads to customers. Making display ads easier and then increasing usability to Amazon demand site platform. So we've been working on a number of those areas and then developing new products and a lot of that's focused around, how are we serving brands from various areas Twitch [ph] sponsored brands, stores of course, so another interesting area. We're certainly in a unique position to be able to provide measurement services that help all these brands or understand the impact of other advertising in ways they're going to help them grow their business. Video, you mentioned I think video is one that's we're working hard on with some of the OTT video advertising opportunities there. We're seeing some good momentum with that. We offer inventory and IMDB TV, ad supported space and 3P apps [indiscernible] pulling off the Fire TV. I think good momentum and a lot of good learning on some of those initiatives there. I won't say too much about what we'll look like next year in the future but that gives you kind of sense of priorities where we're spending our time and focused on. Dave Fildes : And your question on video, so we step back in our goals to deliver high quality and fresh content to our global Prime member base. We're doing that by producing top tier US content that we show globally and then we augment that with local originals in each region. If we do that job well - we've seen it as a very significant acquisition channel from new Prime members especially in many smaller countries around the world. We see higher free trial conversion rates. Higher membership renewable rates and then higher overall engagement as I mentioned in Q3 specifically. And when they do that, when the more engaged they are, we know that, that turns into more sales on Amazon and it's a self-reinforcing loop. So we're very happy with the video performance particularly during this period. I think people have gotten really good chance to test out the content maybe Prime members [indiscernible] that benefit as much in the past, have given another look and have you know really found value in it. We're in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide and again we're seeing some really interesting localized content developing in places like India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, UK and Spain which I think the customers in those countries really appreciate. Dave Fildes : Great, thanks for joining us today for the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello and welcome to our Q4 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, February 2, 2021 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining us today. I realize that you may have questions about the news which we announced today in our press release, but I would like to begin with some comments on Q4 results, and then we can proceed to your questions. First, I\u2019d like to start by thanking the nearly 1.3 million Amazon employees who have risen to the challenge of serving customers around the world during this pandemic. We are proud that more than 500,000 people chose to take new jobs at Amazon in 2020. We are committed to providing all employees with great jobs, including $15 an hour starting pay in the U.S., health insurance, 401(k) matching, leading parental benefits, and upskilling opportunities. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations in stores as well as the customers shopping in our Whole Foods Market and other stores. Our Q4 results include approximately $4 billion in COVID-related operating costs, including additional employee pay during the holidays. We continue to see productivity headwinds from physical separation and training of new employees and of course investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. This Q4 spend brings our total COVID-related costs for the year to more than $11.5 billion. Our teams worked hard in 2020 to ramp up in-house COVID-19 testing capabilities that are incremental to those already available to the general public. More than 700 employees are now being tested every hour, and globally we have built hundreds of COVID-19 testing sites in two labs. We are encouraging essential employees working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers, and Whole Food Market stores across the country to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time. We are also working at the federal and state levels to support the vaccinations of frontline employees and those in the community who are providing essential services throughout the pandemic, including enabling pop up clinics in Washington State and Florida with more on the way. Now some comments on Q4 results. Our fourth-quarter holiday season has always been the busiest time of our year. This year presented additional challenges for our teams as we work to meet strong customer demand, while simultaneously growing our operations\u2019 footprint and welcoming far more new employees than any prior Q4. We welcomed nearly 175,000 new full and part-time employees in Q4 alone. This compares with 50,000 in Q4 of 2019. We also continue to add buildings in our fulfillment and logistics network with square footage growing about 50% year-over-year in 2020. And unlike in a typical year when new buildings are mostly in place by the end of Q3, this year a significant number of them came online in Q4 as our teams pulled out all the stops to be ready for customer demand, and it turns out we needed that capacity in order to fill the strong customer demand in Q4. Revenue for the quarter was $125.6 billion versus our guidance range of $112 billion to $121 billion. You will remember that we kicked off the holiday season early for customers with Prime Day in October versus its usual timing in Q3. We then saw strong seasonal holiday demand through Q4. Our Q4 results also largely reflect the continuation of demand trends we have seen since the early months of the pandemic, particularly as people are staying at home, including for household staples and other home products. We saw sales growth across our major product categories, led by strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. Prime members also continue to expand their usage of Prime\u2019s digital benefits including Prime Video and Prime Video channels. Amazon Music launched podcast in September and in Q4, Prime members listened to millions of hours of podcasts each month. We\u2019re reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q4, we had another strong quarter that largely reflects the continuation of demand trends from Q3. We saw strong growth in new Prime member sign-ups. As demand remained strong in the quarter, the additional volume leverage helped to achieve higher-than-expected profits. We saw strong order volumes throughout the holiday season with good sales growth not only in our peak sales days, which include Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, but also throughout the remainder of the quarter. We had good operational performance within our fulfillment centers and transportation network even as we added significant capacity. Third-party sellers also stepped up as never before to serve customers. The 2020 holiday season was the best ever for small and medium-sized businesses selling in our store, with our worldwide sales growing over 50% year-over-year in Q4. Third-party units represented 55% of total paid units during the quarter, the highest 3P unit mix we\u2019ve ever had since we invited businesses to sell on Amazon more than 20 years ago. Lastly, AWS\u2019 efforts were headlined by our Ninth Annual re :Invent Conference. This is the first time in our history that the event was virtual and free. We had over 570,000 registered attendees during the three-weeks-long event. AWS continues to innovate at a rapid clip, announcing more than 180 new services and features at re :Invent across compute, storage, database, machine learning, and more. You can read more about this in our earnings release. The team also announced significant customer momentum with new commitments and migrations from JPMorgan Chase, Thomson Reuters, ViacomCBS, and Twitter just to name a few. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. In Q4, AWS saw continuation of strong usage and revenue growth. AWS added more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in any quarter in its history and is now a $51 billion annualized run-rate business supporting millions of active AWS customers. And just as they have all year, sellers, partners, and employees across Amazon stepped up to deliver on unprecedented customer demand, and for this we remain extremely grateful. And today, we announced that our Founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter this year and that Andy Jassy will become Chief Executive Officer at that time. Those of us who know Andy are excited to see him take on this greater responsibility. He is a visionary leader, a great operator, and he understands what makes Amazon such a special innovative company. We are also excited that Jeff will retain a very important role at the company that he founded and has guided for over 25 years. He has created a culture of invention and innovation that drives us every day, and we remain bound by our common focus and obsession on the customer. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig a bit deeper into the incredible acceleration that we saw in the international business, obviously, pandemic aside, wondering if you could help us sort of break down the pieces of what drove that into specific regions, specific initiatives that drove that level of acceleration? And then just on the AWS business, bit more of a housekeeping question, would you mind going through just where the backlog stands and any material drivers of changes in the that to the extent there has been any? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thank you, Heath. I would start on international segment results. So yes, it was sequential growth jump from 33% in Q3 to 50% in Q4. Part of that is the timing of Prime Day, but in the U.S. it was less pronounced, sequential growth was 39% to 40% in the North America segment. So, there was something else going on in international in Q4. I would attribute it really to the government actions and lockdowns that we saw, especially in the UK and Europe. I think that increased during the quarter unfortunately for the economy, but it did drive higher sales on our site. We also saw probably a larger impact of moving Prime Day from Q3 to Q4 in international just because it\u2019s a little more nascent there, it\u2019s still ramping up but very strong performance. Dave Fildes : Yes, Heath, this is Dave. On the backlog number, it\u2019s at about $50 billion at the end of the year, the balance and that\u2019s up about 68% year-over-year. So that\u2019s one component of all the great work that AWS is doing, and of course you are seeing some continued very strong growth, strong usage and revenue growth there, $51 billion annualized run-rate business. So, it\u2019s continuing to grow at a meaningfully larger absolute dollar rate than others out there, and we are really pleased with the growth we are seeing in there. It\u2019s as Brian touched on at the opening, just a lot of good engagement and innovation coming out of the re :Invent conference as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Just following up on some of the comments you made between the release and in your opening comments, Brian, wanted to know if we could tease out how we should be thinking about the level of investments that are needed between the mix of fulfillment versus where you want to go on the customer service side and the logistics and delivery side as you look up to \u201821. And obviously, it\u2019s going to be a very different year in \u201821 than what we saw in \u201820, where you saw a surge in demand and a lot of capacity constraints that have opened up as the year goes on. And there will be sort of tougher comp dynamics as you get into the middle of \u201821 as you are lapping against that demand impact in \u201821? How do we think about the levels of investment you will make, where those investments are going to go, and what that means for sort of confidence on the demand side over the medium to long-term? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Eric. Obviously, we had a large investment last year, crew fulfillment capacity, including transportation 50% year-over-year. I would say that \u2013 and it\u2019s been, I believe it\u2019s $44 billion on CapEx, yes. We are still working through our plans for 2021. I think the added complexity here is the range of outcomes certainly was the case in 2020, but even for 2021, there is a lot of question as to the continuation of COVID conditions comping against prior year sales, sometimes there are things in there that definitely wouldn\u2019t repeat probably the number of gloves we sold and hand lights [ph] and things like that or computer monitors that people setup their home offices. But there is also a lot of people who engage more strongly with Prime benefits in 2020, and we think that will have a lasting impact both from purchase frequency, amount they purchased, use of digital benefits, etcetera. So, we are going to have to build probably for multiple scenarios, and in this FC [ph] world, it\u2019s hard to turn that capacity on quickly. So, it generally means you may have to overbuild to protect the customer experience. On transportation, we made large investments in our transportation network in 2020. That work is not done yet. We have a lot of continued expansion. So, we see that over definitely through 2021. I can\u2019t quantify it right now only \u2013 I am only giving guidance through Q1 right now, and we are still working some -- through some of the plans as we do this time of the year. And then infrastructure will remain a healthy part of our investment as well. We are supporting an AWS business that is growing at a rapid clip both in usage and in revenue. We are expanding regions globally and have a lot of upside in that area talking with customers on their transition plans to the cloud. So, we definitely do not want to run out of capacity, and we work to not do that. So, there could be a risk of forward spend in 2021 due to the uncertainty, but we will see as we move through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Sorry, I was muted. Brian, hoping you could talk more about the importance of AMZL Amazon Logistics during the holiday season. If you could talk more about percentage of packages perhaps shipped from your fulfillment centers and then where this can go in coming years? And then also a quick comment on the COVID costs, you mentioned $2 billion in 1Q, just curious how you think about it more on a full year basis with some of the puts and takes can be there? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. So yes, for the full year, we are again $11.5 billion was our gross cost for 2020, $4 billion of that in Q4. We see a step down to closer to $2 billion in Q1 that compares with a $600 million spend last Q1 as the pandemic just started and we started to react in March. And obviously, this cost escalated in Q2 and Q3. So, if we look at the core components of that, right, there is productivity that \u2013 productivity drags from hiring so many new employees and also having physical separation. That gets better all the time. It was exasperated a bit in Q4, because of all the new hires that we brought on over 170,000 new people that should moderate. That\u2019s why one of the reasons that we see a step down in Q1 versus Q4, it\u2019s volume-related and also mix of employees. After that, we are going to have to see again hopefully the vaccine gets going, everyone gets vaccinated and we return to normalcy. That would be very helpful on a lot fronts for everybody. And if not there will be continuation of some of these costs. I will say that, while we are very transparent or try to be on the costs that we are seeing, specifically around COVID, there are some positive things happening as that counteract a bit of that and not the least of which is the top line volume in 2020, we grew 37% on an FX neutral basis versus growing 22% in 2019. And the fact that we have been running pretty full out since arguably April, but definitely it\u2019s May, has created operating efficiencies of its own that counterbalance the physical separation and the training of new employees. So there is a lot of moving parts in here. We are able to save about $1 billion in transportation costs this year \u2013 excuse me in 2020 as for universally, all travel was shutdown and our sales teams found new ways to reach customers. We will see how that develops over time. Marketing, although it got back to probably more healthy levels in Q3 and Q4 definitely was lower in Q2 as we work through some capacity issues and it wasn\u2019t fruitful to invest in marketing when you are having trouble hitting existing customer demand. So, there are a lot of moving parts that I will try and be as transparent on as I can be during the quarter and this again Q1 is we are seeing about $2 billion of absolute COVID costs. And Dave can take the AMZL question. Dave Fildes : Yes. Just as we talk about AMZL, Amazon Logistics, right, that\u2019s where you think about that in terms of facilities, it\u2019s a lot of the middle mile and the last mile elements that are under our management and control. And so you are talking about centers at the middle mile delivery station to the last mile. We have talked on a square footage basis 2020 was a big build year for us. Our footprint grew around 50%, about half of that incremental square footage fit into that sort of AMZL transportation side of the equation, which is a higher mix than what you have seen of any incremental adds in a year. It\u2019s higher mix being 50 :50 than what you see from us in the past. So, a lot of focus on that there both because of the desire to pre-pandemic increase the one day delivery capabilities for Prime members. That also as we have moved through this year, it gives us a little bit more or much more certainty on being able to get items from point A to point B. So we finished here where now more than half our packages, both U.S. and worldwide are handled through AMZL and a lot of work going into that. And so, we will look to expand and continue to build on that with our AMZL offerings. But as we have said in the past, our delivery partners, independent delivery partners that are out there, the USPS is certainly oversees carriers as well, are an important part of that and they will continue to help us scale that up and build up that offering and make it better. Operator : Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. John Blackledge : Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, the other revenue line saw significant acceleration in 4Q, just curious if you can talk about or provide some further color on the advertiser demand that you saw in the fourth quarter? And then secondly on grocery was a big driver for Amazon in 2020 just general thoughts on grocery and I think you mentioned in the release, 7 communities rolled out Amazon Fresh grocery stores, how are they performing and should we expect a broader rollout? Brian Olsavsky : Sure, John. Let me start with the other revenue question. Yes, we saw strength in other revenue grew 64% in Q4 versus 49% in Q3 and 41% in Q2 that is primarily advertising. That\u2019s the majority of it. I would say that there has been a recovery, in advertising spend as the year progressed. The fact that we moved Prime Day into Q4 has an impact here, because again it carries a lot of clicks and eyeballs into Q4 for this time period. But I want to highlight a lot of great work being done by the advertising team. Their main principle is to help sellers, vendors, authors, publishers and partners use our tools, navigate them as fluidly as possible, and add value both for them and for our customers \u2013 and customers and get to see and find and discover new and different products. There is some things that are adding to the efficiency of advertising. We are now using a deep learning model to show more relevant sponsored products and had success with that. We are improving the relevancy of ads shown on the product detail pages all the time. And we have seen rapid adoption of video creative format for sponsored brands. All these things help checkup the conversion and the productivity of the advertising both for the seller or vendor involved and also for Amazon and makes it more productive experience with the customer as well. Dave Fildes : John, on the grocery point, yes, we have got a couple of different formats, I think there is the Go Grocery has a couple of locations open and off to a good start, lot of interest in those and the technology that those offer as well as the Amazon Fresh locations. So we are at about 8 locations open and I think in the neighborhood of about half dozen locations are confirmed at open, so more to come on those. There is other kind of tangents of footprints on that, the Go stores, there is around 25 of those that are out there and that also important part of that is food. So, you see us it\u2019s we have talked about this a bit in the past is we are doing that with online grocery and branching out from Whole Foods and some of the other physical footprint locations and being able to offer that convenience, but we also think that being able to offer some innovative physical store grocery offerings like these Go and Fresh, some of which have some pretty cool self-checkout capabilities and implement some of the Just Walk Out technology qualities are really some interesting areas that are resonating with customers. I think they appreciate that not just in times of maybe not wanting to have physical contact with everyone in the store, but just even beyond that, the general convenience of being able to move throughout the store and check out more efficiently than you otherwise would in a traditional retail environment, so excited to do more on that front. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, I would be curious to hear about any of the learnings you had from the strength of the international business in 2020 and how you think about the right types of investments to make in that business in \u201821 and beyond to ensure you retain as many of these users and wallets as you\u2019ve gained throughout 2020? And the second one understanding the comments, Brian, earlier about sort of investments going forward, maybe just talk to us a little bit about one-day. Are these investments you are making, could they get you back to a one-day product in later part this year or in \u201822 when the world normalizes or are these assets you are putting in place now not able to be deployed from a one day perspective when overall e-commerce slows down a little bit? Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Brian. Let me start with your international question. I think the biggest learning is that if we can move 2021 volume into 2020, it creates good leverage for us and it\u2019s kind of what we saw. There was essentially a doubling of the growth rate versus probably the going in time \u2013 rate for 2020. Now again, that was a very hard volume because of the COVID restrictions and issues with our workforce, keeping our workforce safe and everything else, but I think what you saw was some very high leverage on that model that overcame some of the more fixed costs that we\u2019re seeing in the Prime benefits. So we pre-invested, as we have discussed in the past, in things like video and devices and other elements of the Prime offering, now grocery, you\u2019re starting to see. And we have added those Prime benefits ahead of probably the curve that you would have seen in North America. So that has always created a bit of a drag on operating income, that as well as investments in new geographies, the investment in India, the investment that we\u2019ve made over the last two or three years that are in places like the Middle East, Turkey, Brazil, Australia, most recently, Sweden and the Netherlands in 2020. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in the international segment. But you\u2019re starting to see the benefit of the higher volumes and with it, higher advertising as well that we expected and we expect over-time. And we\u2019ll see the growth rate is going to have the same challenges year-over-year that perhaps we\u2019ll see in North America we\u2019re going to have a race between lapping things that may have been one-time in nature in 2020 versus accelerating Prime membership and Prime members\u2019 purchases, purchase frequency and adoption of digital benefits. So we will see what that looks like in 2021, very happy with the performance in 2020 and really hats off to the teams in many countries around the world who are all dealing with the same issues that we were in North America. Dave Fildes : And I know this is a bit of an offshoot, but I just think it\u2019s worth mentioning it fits in the AWS business, but we\u2019re continuing to see strong growth from AWS around the world as well. And there is a number of international located customers out there like MercadoLibre and Zalando and others that we\u2019ve listed in there that are great customers for us. So we\u2019re working on that and really looking to support that just globally. And I mentioned this before, but re :Invent, it was a great way to bring a lot of those folks from around the world together virtually and free. And typically, we\u2019ve recorded the revenue for re :Invent from ticket sales and sponsorships. If you account for this COVID anomaly this year of it being virtual and free, AWS year-over-year revenue growth, if you look at it, actually accelerated adjusting for that from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So a lot of fun innovation, good innovation coming out of that event that we\u2019re excited to talk more with customers about. Brian Olsavsky : And then your question on one-day, I believe it was whether our investments will be consistent with establishing higher and higher levels of one-day. Yes, definitely. And we\u2019ve been doing that throughout the year and it\u2019s been getting better. In fact, we had a lot of examples of deliveries right up to the last minute on December 24 in the United States for holiday gifts. So the one-day has been getting better, and it\u2019s \u2013 the issues in 2020 was essentially around capacity and volume and getting things at the door and being able to then hit a shortened time period. So it wasn\u2019t that we were delaying or slowing down the shipment itself, it was the time taken to get through the warehouse and handle backlog of demand. So as the year progressed, we did see that get better and better. We do forecast that it will get better. I\u2019m not quantifying this for you. I realize that. But I think you can generally notice wherever you\u2019re particularly are, whatever geography you are, some cities are back probably to one-day levels that they saw or even better pre-pandemic. Other areas that may have other dynamic issues are still working their way out of backlogs and volume issues. But when the dust settles and as we open up more and more capacity, you\u2019ll see greater and greater one-day percentages for our Prime shipments. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post : Alright, thank you. A couple. First, obviously, the Jeff Bezos announcement is quite important. I think Jeff Wilke is also retiring. Can you talk a little bit if you expect any changes to Amazon, how we should think about that? And then maybe Dave Clark is taking over retail. Talk a little bit about that. And then secondly, obviously, the backlog is really strong in AWS, up 68%. The margins did come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter to 28%. Can you talk about the deals, how pricing is in the cloud segment? Is it remaining robust and any reason the margins came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Justin. Let me start with your comments on the CEO transition and then the Consumer CEO transition. I think they\u2019re both examples of what are highly effective succession planning processes at Amazon. The Board of Directors obviously takes that very seriously. It is an annual discussion and probably more often on succession plans, development of key executives, expanding the number of key executives, etcetera. And you see the byproduct of that as we expand the S team as we, 5 years ago, set up the two-CEO structure where Jeff Wilke was CEO of Consumer and Andy Jassy was CEO of AWS. We have strong single-thread leaders on devices, Amazon or \u2013 Video, including Amazon Studios, Advertising. So I think there\u2019s a lot of bench strength within Amazon and generally, we do try and push the decisions down in the organization as we scale, especially internationally as we try and do things consistently globally, but recognize local differences in our model. So having said all that, succession planning is super important. The example you saw with Jeff Wilke, Jeff announced in the fall that he was stepping down to pursue some other goals and interest that he has outside of Amazon. He had been here over 20 years, had been super pivotal in our development of our consumer business, our culture, the development of layers and layers of leaders. And one of them was Dave Clark, who has, over the last 5 plus years, really been charged with developing some very fundamental things for our Company, the expansion of the fulfillment center network, the expansion and creation of our transportation capacity, grocery delivery and the grocery plan, a lot of other things. But Dave had been great leader in his own right. So when Dave \u2013 or, excuse me, when Jeff Wilke decided to retire in the fall, it was a natural transition to Dave Clark. And that just occurred in January, and they\u2019re wrapping things up in the next month. So that\u2019s a successful example of succession planning and a successful transition. Same thing for Jeff Bezos\u2019 role and I will reiterate that Jeff is not leaving. He is getting a new job. He\u2019s going to be Executive Chair of the Board, super important role. The Board is super active and important in Amazon\u2019s success story. And Andy has been here since 1997. He is not only a visionary leader. He is a strong operator as I said and he has got a great track record of developing multiple things and businesses within Amazon, not the least of which is AWS, which is arguably the most profitable, important technology company in the world. So that\u2019s just a flavor on the insight on how it works. We\u2019re very happy to see both Jeff and Andy get new perspectives. So Andy has a chance to put his imprint on Amazon. He is certainly going to carry through the culture and the vision and the invention factory that Amazon is and will take that to the next level. Jeff will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. He will be involved in many large one-way-door issues, as we say, one-way doors, meaning the more important decisions, things like acquisitions, things like strategies and going into grocery and other things. So Jeff\u2019s always been involved with that, and that\u2019s where we will keep his time focused on \u2013 or he will keep his time focused on in his new role, so very excited all around to see the ability to have a strong transition to Andy in Q3. We will be working on backfilling the AWS role and we will talk more about that in the future, but for now, today is about Andy and Jeff Bezos. Dave Fildes : And Justin, just on your AWS point, I mean, like I\u2019ve mentioned before, AWS growth rate is strong. The factors we\u2019ve talked about in the past continue to be in play. We\u2019re improving infrastructure planning to meet the capacity needs, given the growth we\u2019re seeing. More broadly, our results reflect that balance between the investing, the price reductions, driving cost efficiencies and the margins are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on those factors to the extent we are investing in new regions and some other elements. A few discrete things that aren\u2019t probably new but just to call out, the driver of the reduced impact from the change in the useful life of the servers. As you recall, we amended the server useful life at the beginning of the year from 3 to 4 years, and so we saw some benefit to the AWS margins and the broader margins in total. When we look at that, the impact does diminish throughout this year. So when we increased it beginning in January, the benefit from this change in Q4 was about $538 million. That\u2019s down from $634 million in Q3. So that gives you some sense of it\u2019s coming down. That\u2019s the total amount that\u2019s allocated amongst the segments, but the majority of those figures I just gave do relate to AWS because significance of the server assets going to that segment. And again, that impact\u2019s going to continue to taper down over time for example into Q1 of 2021. One other element is just FX impact. That\u2019s always going to hit us to some degree, but AWS customer billings are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. The cost, though, if you think about it, many of the costs are going to be for build-out in local currency for data centers and the people that work there and power and what have you, so there\u2019s a bit of a foreign exchange difference there. And that happens to be this time around a little bit bigger. We saw an unfavorable impact of about $96 million to the AWS margin this time around for FX, so just another point to call out there. You mentioned the backlog, too. Look, I think that\u2019s one data point amongst many as you look at AWS, but I think we\u2019re really encouraged by just general large enterprise business adoption is continuing to do well as they are choosing AWS as a tech provider and speeding up innovations. You saw a long list of the many companies that we have announced arrangements within the past 90 days, so really excited to continue to build onto that. Operator : Our final question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Yes, just going back to the topic of shipping cost inflation. This is one of the few lines that\u2019s kind of variable and kind of increasing a little bit faster than the other fixed costs. And Dave, you mentioned that over half the orders are now going through Amazon Logistics worldwide. When do you expect that rate of inflation per order to level out a little bit because of these efforts? And if you look at the cost curve in places like the UK where \u2013 or in London, where you have well over half on your own last-mile delivery, are you starting to see leverage there? Any comments on that? And thanks a lot. Dave Fildes : Yes. On that \u2013 this is Dave. I think it\u2019s not \u2013 I won\u2019t give a forward kind of guidance mix or what that levels-off like. Some of the step-up in costs and disparity or the bigger gap, I should say, versus the unit growth rates that you\u2019re seeing there, there\u2019s a few factors. But I think this is Q4. We did add on a lot of new capacity as I said. It came on later in the year into Q4. More of it was in kind of that transportation arm and so the costs associated with that would be going to that trans cost piece. So that\u2019s one of the factors, along with the fact that we\u2019re continuing to try where we can to focus on improving one-day. And that varies region to region with all the kind of challenges of COVID that have gone on this year. But that\u2019s a goal of ours, is to get back to where we were in terms of one-day unit mix and continue to build onto that. So that\u2019ll be something to keep an eye on as we move into 2021. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 29, 2021 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity; workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining us today. Before we get to Q&A, I will touch upon a few highlights from the first quarter of the year. Let me start by highlighting the momentum we are seeing in AWS. In the first quarter, AWS revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. During COVID, we've seen many enterprises decide that they no longer want to manage their own technology infrastructure. They see that partnering with AWS and moving to the cloud gives them better cost, better capability and better speed of innovation. We expect this trend to continue as we move into the post-pandemic recovery. There's significant momentum around the world, including broad and deep engagement across major industries. For example, last quarter, we announced new commitments and migrations from some of the world's most renowned sports leagues, the National Hockey League, the PGA Tour, Formula 1 and the German Bundesliga.  We continue to expand our AWS infrastructure footprint to support the strong growth we're seeing. AWS offers 80 availability zones across 25 geographic regions around the world. And we've announced plans to launch 15 more availability zones in five more regions. Turning to the consumer business, we continue to see strong customer demand globally in the first quarter. Revenue growth in our international segment grew 50% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in Q1 as restrictive regional and national lockdowns were in place throughout the quarter, particularly in the UK and Europe. In North America, revenue growth of 39%, largely reflects the continuation of demand trends that we have seen since the early months of the pandemic. Third-party sellers were largely comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, continue to see strong sales and serve more customers. Our 3P seller services revenue increased 60% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in the first quarter, growing significantly faster than online stores revenue. Third-party units represented 55% of our total paid units in Q1, up from 52% in Q1 of last year.  Prime members also continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic. These trends have also extended to Prime's digital benefits. Over the past 12 months, Prime Video streaming hours were up over 70% year-over-year. Amazon Studio had its best award season yet, and Prime members can look forward to a strong slate of upcoming original series and films featuring an impressive group of diverse talent and creators. We're also continuing to expand our roster of live sports content, and we're excited to partner with the NFL and be the exclusive home of NFL Thursday Night Football into the next decade.  Twitch is also seeing great momentum. Hours watched on Twitch nearly doubled year-over-year in the first quarter, and we now average more than 35 million daily visitors. Another popular benefit of Prime membership is Prime Day, and we are excited to announce that we will hold the two-day savings event during the second quarter. Prime Day is also a great opportunity for our selling partners to reach more customers, and will make supporting small businesses a big focus again this year. We'll have more to share on Prime Day, including the event dates a bit later this quarter. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees. In the U.S., Amazon has held on-site vaccination events in 29 states, reaching more than 300,000 frontline employees and contractors. We are watching events closely in Europe and in particular, India, where we have put in place employee initiatives, from medical health lines, teleconsulting, hotel rooms for quarantining and financial support, as well as donating 100 ICU ventilator units to local hospitals. We'll continue to invest in the health and safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our global fulfillment and logistics operations. And finally, to summarize our financial results. Total revenue of $108.5 billion came in above the guidance range of $100 billion to $106 billion. In addition to our strong segment results, advertising revenue within the North America and international segments also accelerated during the quarter. The leverage we are seeing on this higher revenue, combined with strong operational performance led to higher operating income as well.  Operating income of $8.9 billion in Q1 was above our guidance range of $3 billion to $6.5 billion. We incurred a little less than the $2 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs that we had projected in the first quarter. We continue to incur these costs across our global fulfillment network as we maintain social distancing measures, which impacts our productivity and as we make direct investments in employee safety. Looking ahead, we expect to incur approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs in the second quarter.  Lastly, I'd like to congratulate and thank our employees for making Amazon #1 in the U.S. on LinkedIn's 2021 top companies ranking, an annual list identifying the most sought-after places to work. We appreciate the customer obsession and passion for innovation from teams across the company to make Amazon a great place to work. With that, let's move on to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ross Sandler : Great. Thanks, Brian. A question on last-mile delivery. So you guys are investing pretty aggressively to build out that Amazon control last-mile fulfillment. We see the blue vans driving around everywhere in the Bay Area, so congrats on that. So I guess the question is, how long until you feel like if that's in the right place as far as all your major metros where you want to set that up. And at what stage, does the unit cost of shipping start to improve from these initiatives? And I guess, high level, is controlling the last mile allowing you to further penetrate or gain market share in certain categories where speedy delivery is of the essence. Can you talk about that, please? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Ross, thanks for your questions. Yes, let me start with last mile in general. So we're investing heavily. We talked about it last year, our fulfillment, including Amazon Logistics investment, we increased our capacity by 50%. And you can see from our CapEx numbers, the CapEx, including infrastructure, of course, increased to 80% in the trailing 12 months over the prior trailing 12 months. So certainly, a large area of investment, not only fulfillment centers, but also two elements of transportation, what we call the middle mile where we're putting sort centers, Amazon Air, line haul, trailers, think of all the intermediate movements between our warehouses and our final delivery stations. And then that last mile was just delivery stations, DSP and seeing our delivery service partners as well.  So you talked about costs. We actually think our cost right now is very competitive with our external options, and we measure that very closely. It certainly gets better with demand and amortization and route density, et cetera. But we see, which is very helpful, is the ability to control the whole flow of products from the warehouse to the end customer. Its churn would -- normally was a batch process where we would hand off a large batch of orders to a third-party once a day, let's say, to a continuous flow process, where we continually have orders leaving our warehouses five, six times a day going through middle mile and then to final delivery, either through our AMZL drivers or DSP partners.  So that gives us a lot of ability not only to control the flow of the product, but also flow of information. We're seeing a lot of progress in that area. And I think you'll see it, too, as a customer where you're starting to get more precise estimates of delivery. You'll get notes that say, hey, you're eight stops away from your delivery, et cetera. Because everyone's busy. A big part of delivery is actually being there sometimes when you need to get -- be there for the delivery. Other times, Of course, you can just have it put on your doorstep and get to it later. But that's -- we see a lot of benefit from that. We also see that there's a lot of cutoff times that we can extend, again, because we pretty much have perfect information between the order placement allocation to warehouses where we're going to pick and box up the product and send it on its way. So lots of advantages. We are continuing to invest, and we'll see a large investment in this area through 2021 as well.  We do think that it may also spill to 2022. That should set us up in really good stead with our capacity. And already, the majority of our units are going through AMZL today. Dave Fildes : This is David, Ross. Just to add to that, Ryan touched upon it, but there are an important part of this last-mile effort has been the program we've had, the -- Brian called this -- mentioned the delivery services partner program, or the DSP, it's an important part of the last-mile network. And that -- just as a reminder, that employs more than 100,000 drivers, and it's been growing for the past few years. And it's really -- it's a program with an incentive for those folks to become small business owners and start their own package delivery business. So it's a great way for those folks to access the delivery technology and the package volumes we have and tapping on the network. And we've got a lot of really cool elements as part of that program, grant programs to support entrepreneurs and minority groups and really help them build out and helps us support a diverse business community as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. On AWS, I'm curious if you could give us a backlog number. And there have been a lot of questions about the incredible backlog strength you've seen in the last several quarters, and it finally seems that you're seeing the conversions between that backlog growth and now revenue growth accelerating. If you could just comment a little more on that conversion and how you expect it to trend? Thank you. Dave Fildes : Yes, hey Brent, it's Dave. I think it's -- the backlog growth, just to give you the figures for March 31, it's $52.9 billion. The weighted average life is about where we've been for the past several quarters, so about -- a little over three years in terms of the weighted average remaining life. So that's up about 55% right now. So it really continues to be really strong and really pleased with that. I think that's backlog figures, but also just the revenue growth and the momentum we're seeing in here is a lot of hard work and innovation on the teams and growing teams and reaching out and working with those. And so you can expect to continue to see customers making these long-term commitments. We think it's a representation you think of a lot of companies that have worked with us, been engaged with us, been with us. And as they get better comfort line of sight with what they want to do and as we are able to add even more value and services, it's just a great partnership and a relationship that they want to build with us over those multi-year periods. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Youssef Squali : Thank you very much. Maybe just a two-part question. First, Brian, you touch upon this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the acceleration in international growth. Can you maybe just speak to the drivers there? And in, particularly in markets where COVID is no longer a major issue, have you seen any particular declines or maybe just slowdown in e-commerce demand or a decline in growth? It seems like they're going in different directions in Europe, for instance, it seems like the -- a lot of these markets are still very much under lockdown, yet your international business has grown pretty significantly. I don't know if there is positive or negative correlation. Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Thanks, Youssef. Yes, I would say we're seeing strength pretty much across the board in international. And it does vary by country. But if you just step back a minute, on an - even on an FX-neutral basis, we grew 50% in the quarter. We grew 50% last quarter, although that's aided by the fact that Prime Day was in Q4 this year. But if you look at the growth rate prior to COVID and post-COVID, in the international segment, on a -- even on an FX-neutral basis, has been tripling their prior growth rate in revenue anyway. So very strong and probably advancement of the model in a lot of countries by a year or more. And we're really pleased that we've been able to show our value to those customers, not only with our shipments and our ability to deliver and get them what they need to survive in homes in place during the pandemic, but also the strength that we've seen in the digital offering and the adoption of video, music, our devices. So it's really -- and we're forward investing, as you know, in that, in international with a lot of those Prime benefits. So it's really -- it's good to see as the underlying consumer shipping business, part of it grows, that we're still seeing healthy engagement and growing engagement. So I don't have a downside case yet. In fact, surprised a bit by the growth. I don't think we normally would have forecasted 50% growth in Q1. And certainly stressing our operations. But I would -- my hat's off to the operations team, they handled the volumes in Q1 very efficiently. Costs were very much under control. We started to see strong leverage of our fixed assets, especially our fulfillment center and transportation assets. Dave Fildes : And this is Dave. And just these aren't big contributors by any means to the growth numbers Brian was talking about. But I think along with those efforts in countries we've been in for some period of time. We're continuing to open up new regions. If you look back, Poland recently opened up in March, Sweden opened up in the fourth quarter of last year. And even in some regions that we've been in for a few years, places like Turkey, we launched Prime in the back half of last year. So there's a lot of good effort and thought going into -- by the teams to continue kind of taking what we're learning in each of these geographies and feeding it back into a local presence to take advantage of everything we've learned with Prime and the broader consumer-facing experience. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Ed Yruma : You guys clearly took some market share with delivery and grocery during the pandemic. Just wondering how -- what the consumer behavior has been post -- is it proving to be sticky? And just kind of zooming out, talking about grocery broadly, how the fresh store's performed? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Grocery has been a great revelation during the post-pandemic period here. I think people really value the ability to get home delivery. And we've seen that as numbers go up considerably pre and post-pandemic. So -- but we've also worked very hard to increase our capacity during that time period. In the United States, we're delivering out of our Whole Foods stores, and we've engaged -- we'll be allowed to pick up a greater expansion of pickup at Whole Foods stores. Amazon Fresh became a free Prime benefit, as you know, in the late part of 2019. And customers really adopted it and continue to see strong growth. So I think on the fresh stores, it's a little too early. The stores themselves, we're confident that the Just Walk Out technology that will be a boon, a benefit to customers. And we're very excited about what's in the works, but that's still really early in day 1. Dave Fildes : Yes. And it's -- we've got -- Ed, this is Dave. We've got about 12 fresh stores right now that are open, and we've confirmed. We've got some additional ones coming in, Southern California and Illinois, New Jersey and then here with us in the Seattle area. So as Brian said, really pleased with the start -- the technology and the feedback from the customers so far. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. John Blackledge : Great. Two questions. The 2Q revenue guide range was strong, despite the initial pandemic comps. Could you just discuss demand levels you're seeing on the e-commerce side, and just other kind of key drivers of strong expected revenue growth in the second quarter. And then on the advertising business, if you can just talk about some of the key drivers of the acceleration. I think it, it feels like it's maybe the third quarter in a row of acceleration. So what's kind of driving that? And how should we think about the trajectory for the business as we round through the year? Brian Olsavsky : Sure, John. Let me start with your second question on advertising. So certainly, traffic has been a large driver of what we're seeing in the advertising space. But it discounts kind of the improvement that we're also seeing, relevancy and new products that the team is, has been rolling out, that the customers also enjoy. So I think the advertising team's done a great job of turning clicks into productive sales, and the advertising that results is valuable to us as well. We're using new deep learning models to show more relevant sponsored products. We continue to improve the relevancy of the ads being shown on the product detail pages. And we've seen rapid adoption of the video creative format for sponsored brands, among other things. So you're seeing a little bit more than just traffic. And again, very pleased with the performance of that team and of the receptiveness of our customers, our vendors, our authors and sellers to our advertising products. We think it's also very valuable for consumers as well, helping them find things more easily and discover new brands. On Q2 guidance, yes, I would say, we are projecting, again, continued strength across all of our segments. We -- I will remind you that Prime Day has been scheduled for later in Q2, and we'll have more on that as the quarter unfolds. So that's a consideration as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : Just wanted to follow up there on Prime Day, Brian. Can you tell us at all just in terms of quantifying or just how you're thinking about the contribution within that 2Q guidance? And then also just on the rationale for timing, given historically in 3Q, we moved to 4Q last year and then now in 2Q. And then hoping you could also just talk about the Thursday Night Football deal, the strategy there, how that drives engagement and strengthens the ecosystem and also what it needs for ad dollars for you. Brian Olsavsky : First on Prime Day, the -- we're not quantifying the size of it. I think there's some pretty good estimates out there that you probably can leverage. But other than to say it's contemplated in this guidance. On the timing, last year, we had intended to hold Prime Day earlier. We -- there are a number of factors, the Olympics, which are still out there this year. In fact, in some -- many areas, July is a big vacation month. So it might be better to have -- for customers, sellers and vendors to experiment with a different time period. We experimented the other way, obviously, in 2020 by moving it into October, but we believe that it might be a better timing later in Q2. So that's what we're testing this year. On Thursday Night Football, I would say just -- I'm not sure I could size the advertising opportunity right now. But we're very excited to have the exclusive content for Thursday Night Football. Of course, we've broadcast Thursday Night Football for a number of years now, shared that responsibility with a lot of other partners. We think we can do some really new and innovative things with that -- with those games, with the NFL, and we're looking forward to kicking that off in earnest. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Two questions. First on the AWS acceleration, was that at all related to transaction volumes coming back for maybe more cyclical sectors? And could 2Q see even more of that? And then secondly, I think in your release, you talked about 175 million Prime members watching video. It's about 7 of 8 users. So just wondering what you see is the effect on your retail business from that? Any updates you could provide on content spending. And how you think about Prime Video as a driver for overall Amazon. Brian Olsavsky : So let me start on the AWS acceleration. We wouldn't point to any particular customer group. We're seeing great usage and expansion across a number of industries and a number of types of customers from startups all the way to enterprises. To put it little bit in perspective for you, in Q1 of 2019, we were at $31 billion run rate. By last year, we had increased that to $41 billion revenue run rate, which is a 32% increase. This year, we're up to a $54 billion annualized run rate, which is, while also a 32% year-over-year growth, it added $13 billion of revenue in the last 12 months as opposed to $10 billion prior -- $10 billion in the prior 12 months before that. So the percentages can be a little deceiving. I would encourage you to look at the absolute dollar growth, although both were very strong in this quarter. So we are seeing, again, strength across the board. We have firm confidence that we offer a lot of advantages to AWS customers from functionality to a vibrant and robust partner ecosystem. And then really, we also have less downtime and better security, which I think is super important to all of our customers, especially security nowadays. So that's on AWS. On -- Dave, why don't you pick up the... Dave Fildes : Yes. Just in terms of strategy, I think there's probably nothing new or surprising, but just to reiterate it, we look at Prime Video as a component of the broader Prime membership and making sure it's driving adoption and retention as it is. It's a significant acquisition channel in Prime countries. And that we look at it and see that members who watch video have higher free trial conversion rates, higher renewal rates, higher overall engagement. And there's great examples of places like Brazil, where you launch a video-only subscription, for example, that preceded the broader Prime membership with shipping components, and that was, as an example, a great way to expose people to Amazon. And as we launched the broader Prime in Brazil, it was a great mechanism to folks into that program. So a lot of, kind of different experiences there. But as the -- as Jeff's quote would indicate, a lot more people are continuing to enjoy it. And I think the studios team has done a great job, really striving to be the best home for talent, getting a lot of diverse artists and filmmakers and, I think folks are noticing that both critically, but of course, just in terms of viewership, a lot of good momentum there. Just in terms of spend, just to say we continue to expect to grow that on an absolute basis and invest in that beyond original content. Brian talked about live sports and a lot of the great opportunities that feed into that, too. So a lot of continued excitement there. Operator : Our final question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. Brian, I wanted to ask you one high level one. You guys have done such a great job building out your network and sort of providing consumers with access to so many categories of goods. Give us a couple of examples of areas where you see room for improvement? What areas are you most focused on when you look across all the categories, delivery experience, the countries to invest in and innovate, to really improve the consumer offering? That's one. And then secondly, can you just talk to us about sort of what you've learned about the Echo journey, areas where you've had success, and still existing opportunities for Echo to have a larger installed base and just more of an impact on the ecosystem. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Brian, for your questions. There's always a lot of areas that we're working to improve upon. I think generally, the speed of innovation is very quick at Amazon, but we always want it to be quicker. And we always want it to be globally consistent, and we want to take the best practices from 1 country to make sure we're doing it the same way everywhere. I think currently on our list right now is that we are in the process of getting our 1-day shipment percentages back up to where they were pre-pandemic. We're there in Europe, and we're starting to see in Europe not only strong 1-day, but also more broad, same-day selection, so they tend to go hand-in-hand. In the U.S., we've made improvements or consistently getting better. I would say the end delivery is really a function of everything before it, and how well we can handle and process in a timely manner all the orders in North America. It's been challenged by the volumes, but it's also been challenged by the rapid expansion of space. But we're making progress nonetheless, and we hope to get that even higher in 2021. We're very excited about the adoption of our Prime benefits pretty much across the board, especially with the digital benefits. We are looking forward to some new content, even though we're very happy with the performance, the studios business and the content and awards that they were nominated for and were able to garner this year. We have some big things on the horizon, including Lord of the Rings, and we're very excited about getting that type of content to our Prime members quicker. Dave Fildes : Yes, Brian. And then just on your question on kind of Echo and if I could take it up a level, really broadly, Alexa and devices. Our goal with that has just been -- continues to be to make customers' lives easier and really more convenient. And we want to continue to bring more hardware choices in that case, but also make Alexa smarter with new features. As we talked about before, advances in AI and machine learning, and really deliver tools that help developers and the makers of those devices build for and with Alexa, because in that community, it's not just our Echo devices, but also a variety of third-party device manufacturers. We've seen a lot of momentum with smart home capabilities and working with them. And so -- and I think with us, with so many other areas, it's about making sure we're maintaining a really high bar, and a lot of that with that type of technology is speech recognition capabilities, the intelligence behind it and getting smarter. And some of that becomes a responsibility that customers have higher and higher expectations for their capabilities, something like Alexa, and that's great. And I think if we just look back over the last 12 months and what's been going on, the role that customer usage has played with Alexa and the behavior there, you've seen, as people have been isolated or unable to be as mobile, you see customers are using Alexa to help them stay connected with loved ones. We're seeing customers using Alexa to help stay healthy. So whether that's interacting with health-related tips or fitness apps or increased usage of the Fire TV, and they're looking to Alexa for information. And so using our devices and the services and the Alexa-enabled services for things like educational apps. And then, of course, part of that, too, is making sure they stay entertained when they're trapped or cooped up and don't have other access. So I think you can just see in that example a lot of really good utility, and it just, I think, encourages our teams to strive even harder to serve customers, given when you see those types of examples and how they resonate with customers. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 29,2021, only, and will include Forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors. detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce, staffing, and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.  Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining us today. Before we get to Q&A, I'd like to first thank all of our Prime members, our vendors, our 3P sellers, and my Amazon colleagues, especially the Worldwide Ops team, for a record-breaking Prime Day in June. Third-party sellers, who are mostly comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, were a big contributor to Prime Day 's success. The Prime Day event was the biggest two-day period ever for these SMBs in our stores, and our 3P revenue continued to grow significantly faster than our online stores revenue.  Third-party units represented 56% of our total paid units in Q2, up from a 53% mix one year ago. Our second quarter net sales were $113 billion or at about the midpoint of our guidance range. That\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 27% or 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and included the shift of Prime Day into Q2 this year, which added about 400 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate. Q2 of this year was a transition period for many of our customers. As the quarter progressed, people were at home less as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of our largest geographies, including the U.S. and much of Europe.  As a result, while Prime members continued to spend more with us, growth in Prime members spend moderated compared to spending seen during the peak of the pandemic. As you look at our recent revenue growth rates, I want to give you some insight into what we are seeing as there have been some noticeable intra-quarter changes in our revenue run rate. Prime Day has also been in three different quarters the past three years, so I will normalize for this impact in my growth rate comments.  Also since FX rates have bounced around, all of my comments exclude foreign exchange. Here\u2019s a quick recap of our growth rates in 2020 and 2021. First, before COVID-19, we've been growing at a revenue growth rate close to 20%. 2019 full-year growth was 22%, and revenue growth for the first two months of 2020 was 21%. Once the pandemic hit and lockdowns began in March 2020, the initial growth rate jumped into the mid-30% range. Q1 of last year ended with a revenue growth rate of 27%. However, our operations network took time to step up to serve this growth in demand due to space constraints and our need to ramp up hiring quickly while prioritizing employee health and safety.  By mid-May of last year, we have made good progress to open up more capacity by adding hundreds of thousands of employees. This allowed our revenue growth rate to jump to the 35% to 45% range and remained at that level through Q1 of this year when we had 41% growth. In Q2 of this year, we began to comp this high sales period from last year, and the year-over-year revenue growth rate has narrowed. It has also narrowed as vaccines become more readily available in many countries and people are getting out of their homes.  Since May 15, again, excluding Prime Day, our year-over-year growth rate has dropped into the mid-teens. Our Q3 revenue guidance range of 10% to 16% growth reflects an expected continuation of this trend. Given all this volatility, it is useful to consider the 2-year compounded annual growth rate, which remained strong in the 25% to 30% range. Recall, this compares to our pre-pandemic growth rate of 21%. This reflects the acceleration of Prime membership and Prime member purchase levels over the past 18 months. While I'm not giving forward guidance beyond Q3 of this year, we do expect this pattern of difficult year-over-year revenue comps to continue for the next few quarters. As we move forward and start to comp COVID 's impact on our revenue growth, we encourage you to also look at the multiyear compounded annual growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this growth in perspective. Now, back to the Q2 highlights. We continue to be very pleased with the Prime member growth and engagement we're seeing. We've been fortunate to welcome more than 50 million new members in the past 18 months, and Prime member benefits usage remains high.  That includes continued strong engagement in Prime's family of digital offerings, like Prime Video's original movies. For example, Prime members helped make The Tomorrow War and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse, the number one streaming movies on their respective opening weekends. Amazon Advertising is innovating at a fast clip, launching over 40 new features and self-service capabilities in the quarter, making it easier for sellers, companies, and authors to grow their businesses by helping customers discover their brands and products.  Other revenue increased 83% year-over-year in Q2, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven largely by continued acceleration in our ads business. Moving on to AWS, revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. We see strong growth in enterprises, governments, educational, and research institutions, and our start-up and digital native customers.  We recently announced new commitments and migrations from customers across a diverse set of major industries, including Swisscom and Bell Canada in Telecom, BMO Financial Group, and Bancolombia in financial services, and Ferrari in automotive. AWS customers recognize that the move to the cloud is very positive for their businesses in the medium and long term. Disruptive economic events like COVID have caused many people to step back and think about how they want to change strategically, and many have come to the conclusion that they do not want to own and run their own datacenters. They assume they can save money and gain agility and innovation by moving to AWS.  I'll finish up with some comments on our ongoing investments in operations. As we think about the pull-forward in demand we've seen these past 18 months, it has required and will continue to require a significant amount of investment in our fulfillment network. Our teams have done a remarkable job stepping up to serve customers and support our vendors and sellers, and we've worked hard to increase capacity at a rapid rate. For the trailing 12 months ended Q2, Capex and equipment finance leases increased 74% versus the prior trailing 12-month period.  And as usual, most of our 2021 spend and building openings are planned in the second half of this year. This is all part of a multi-year investment cycle for us. Unit volumes, while obviously growing at lower rates of last year's large comp continue to remain high, and we see strong demand for FBA and third-party sellers. So, there's more work to do, including additional build-outs of our FCs, as well as our middle mile and last-mile capabilities to support our fast-improving delivery offers for customers.  I encourage you to read the business highlights in our press release. It's a diverse collection of efforts supported by many thousands of customer-focused Amazon employees, from Amazon Pharmacy to Business Prime to to AWS' plans to add seven new regions to NFL Thursday Night Football starting next year, to the Black Business Accelerator program, to Alexa\u2019s collaboration with Ford Motor Company. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. [Operator instructions] Please hold while we poll for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just want to ask two, just going back to the 2Q revenue beyond Prime spend moderating and the reopening, is there anything else you'd point to, in particular, that they have kept you in the middle of the range versus obviously where you've been over the last year versus expectations? And I guess, in particular, can you talk about Prime Day relative to your expectations? And then secondly, the BigCommerce partnership, a couple weeks ago, you seem to have opened up more to working with merchants away from Amazon. Just hoping you could talk more about the multichannel fulfillment opportunity, and do you think you now have the logistics capabilities, and has everything recovered to the point where you can offer these services more to third parties? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Doug. Now as far as Q2 run rate is concerned, if you look back the last few quarters, we've not done a great job of nailing the impact of COVID. We have generally over-performed our guidance range. I think last quarter we had kept the same process coming off some very high volumes for the last prior four quarters. And really, the only difference I see is in Q2 versus Q1, and before is the year-over-year comp, which we had factored in, but also the increase in mobility. I think the impact of people getting vaccinated and getting out in the world, not only shopping offline, but also living life and getting out.  It takes away from shopping time. It's good -- it's a good phenomenon and it's great, and we just have to appropriately gauge our run-rate going forward. So, Prime Day was very successful. We passed the record set in last fall's Prime Day, which was a very different time of year to have Prime Day and started to bump up against early holiday shopping, so we're really pleased. And again, I think it was a great day then for third-party sellers as I pointed out. Dave Fildes : Doug, on your second question, it's Dave here. I\u2019d just say our focus is really squarely on adding capacity to meet the current high customer demand that Brian talked about in his opening remarks. We're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support partners, SMBs in particular who sell on Amazon, and that includes testing shipping programs and newer initiatives that can help those businesses get packages to customers quickly and reliably. So, continue to see us look for ways to be able to innovate where it's appropriate relative to the customer demand we're already seeing in our network. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please, proceed with your question. Colin Sebastian : Thanks very much, guys. I guess sort of masked in the headline results is actually pretty solid performance in the higher margin segments of the business, including third-party services, subscriptions, AWS, and advertising. and then I think that was evident in gross margin as well. I guess my question is whether there is any deliberate shift towards these services or is that just more of an output of somewhat weaker trends you saw after mid-May? And then secondly, is Prime Day still a once per year phenomenon or would you consider separate events spread out during the same year to capitalize on different seasonal trends? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. On the second question, I don't have anything to announce today. Our trend has been once a year. Of course, it's moved between quarters the last three years. So, that's all I have on that one. As far as the higher-margin areas and whether that's a purposeful strategy, I'd like to say it is, but if you look at what they are third-party is kind of a continuation of strength in our FBA program, in particular, I think the sellers are doing a great job of adding additional selection that's very valuable and reinforces our flywheel, and we'd like to see that and you see that third-party percent of units went up from 53% last year to 56%, and that's a steady mark.  We've seen that, as we said, the third-party sellers are doing a great job and we like to see that. On advertising, advertising is, again, another part of our flywheel. We have traffic coming in for the consumer business. And if we do a good job with advertising, we'll make it an additive experience for our customers and our sellers and vendors.  So that's what we work on, is to make sure that it's a relevant experience and adds to your shopping experience and helps you find selection that perhaps you wouldn't have found otherwise or it would've been harder to. And then on AWS, AWS is again, its own separate part of the business. It has been 15 years in the development, and we think our scale and experience really pays dividends. If you looked at the last quarter, AWS set more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year than any quarter in our history. We are now at $59 billion annualized run-rate business, and that's up from 43 billion at this time last year. So, those are output measures as we like to say, the input measures are doing a good job on products, adding new capabilities, and being able to work with our customers to solve their problems.  I think that's what you are seeing and it's matching up well with a renewed emphasis on getting to the cloud by a lot of companies out there. And when they're looking to make that transition, it's giving up control and putting yourself in -- and choosing a partner for the long haul, and we're proud that companies choose us for that journey. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I've two, one a little nitpicky and one kind of big picture. The nitpicky on, Brian, fulfillment on a per unit basis was pretty high in the second quarter given -- relative to normal seasonality. Can you talk about just what's driving that? Is that a new build, new square feet, or are there inefficiencies that went on in the quarter in fulfillment.  And the second one is sort of about bigger picture. In the last quarter, you talked a little bit about same-day in Europe. There\u2019s been some headlines about same-day. How do we think -- how should we think about a larger same-day offering being part of the investment process right now, just to sort of maintain and grow your share of grocery and consumables? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks. Yes, I would say on the fulfillment side, there are a number of things. First, we are adding a lot of capacity. If you step back, the Amazon fulfilled unit volume, so that's the units coming out of our fulfillment centers both retail and FBA have doubled in the past 2 years. And the AMZL, the delivery arm of our business, has more than doubled in that time period. So, you can see there's been very strong multiyear demand here that we're still catching up with from last year. So most of -- I mentioned earlier our year-over-year growth in CapEx and equipment leases is 74% in the second -- at the end of June compared to 38% the year before.  So, we're continuing to add and most of that development is really ahead of us in the second half of the year. So, if you've been with us a long time, you know, the cadence is that as we add demand -- excuse me, as we add capacity, there's a lot of additional costs from hiring to starting up to training, to getting that building or sort center or delivery station up and running. It usually takes a multi-year period to tame those assets.  And we've literally nearly doubled our network here in the last 18 months from a size standpoint. There's a lot of that going on, a lot of strong effort by our fulfillment and ops teams to help mitigate the costs. The other thing is wage pressure has become evident, we've talked about this a bit.  The wage increase for -- that we normally would do in October, we pulled forward into May. We're spending a lot of money on signing and incentives. And while we have very good staffing levels, it's not without cost. It's very competitive labor market out there, and certainly the biggest contributor to inflationary pressures that we're seeing in business. Dave Fildes : Brian, on the second point just around speed, as we've talked about many times, customers respond well to the fast, high-quality delivery and of course, back in 2019, we were talking at that time about expanding the one-day delivery in the U.S. in the Europe, one-day delivery as part of Prime in most of those are sizable European countries where we operate has been standard for many years. We're investing in the transportation network to support the demands, a significant part of the capital investments we've been talking about for the past few years, and certainly since the pandemic's start, has been to support those efforts in middle and last mile capacity to keep pace and support with that demand. So as we [Indiscernible] here that work's not done yet. We're continuing to expand.  You'll see that investment throughout 2021. And that growing transportation network will support faster delivery times for customers. One-day delivery is improving and -- in the U.S. as well as same-day delivery, where it makes sense and where the network is growing there. So we'll have to continue to see how we go, but we are focused on those data points. And we're also focused on improving delivery precision as a way of improving the quality of -- of the overall offering. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Youssef Squali : Thank you very much. I have two questions. One, within online stores, was there any particular area of softness during the quarter? I'm just thinking about maybe some product categories that may have come back, or actually the opposite, may have gone down, the demand for with the reopening that you can maybe highlight.  And then as you look beyond Q3 and Q4, what kind of growth assumptions for e-commerce or just in general for the next couple of years, are you guys working with to build your budget and events against the opportunity? I'm just thinking, are you guys assuming that e-commerce growth remains or it goes back to pre - COVID levels or stays at an elevated level, [Indiscernible] Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with the online store's revenue. You're probably looking at a growth rate of 13% in Q2 versus the revenue growth -- FX-neutral revenue growth rate of 24%. I would point you back to last year in Q2. At that online stores grew 49%, there were restrictions on what we stocked in our warehouses. And as you remember, we had to constrain space for a lot third-party sellers as well as our retail offering. But the mix shifted for the early part of Q2 last year to be more of a retail mix and then MFN mix, and then it flip back to be more balanced mix that you've seen in the past.  On forward investment, here's how I would explain it. Again, we are sitting here with demand volumes that have gone up on an Amazon Fulfilled Network basis. It's doubled in the 2-year period. So we are not back to where we want to be on a number of dimensions. We handled Q4 last year, we've been playing catch-up pretty much since the pandemic started. But what suffered is space and space constraints. And that's -- it's gotten better, but it was a factor last year.  And also our one-day delivery percentage has dropped and has not returned to levels seeing pre-pandemic in the United States, It's on par and getting better than pre-pandemic in Europe. But in the United States, while it's improving, it still hasn't reached the pre-pandemic level. So we have a lot of growth to do there. As far as the stickiness of purchases. I think there's certainly a number of things that were purchased last year that didn't repeat for a lot of retailers.  Things like consumables early on, gloves, cleaning supplies, computer monitors, some things you use to outfit your house. You can probably go through your own checklist of purchases and say, okay, I probably will not do this every year. But there has been a healthy movement to online commerce. We have -- we've added Prime members, and the Prime members that we have have ratcheted up their purchases with us, which was always part of the plan and a good sign. It means we're offering them more things that they can buy and satisfying more their demand needs.  Even in Q2, when, and as I said, rates are starting to moderate, in the quarter, those Prime member purchases still grew year-over-year on a -- per Prime member basis they just didn't grow at the same cliff that they had in the prior 3 or 4 quarters. So that's a good sign. And we like the engagement levels and the retention levels that we see with Prime members.  So all-in-all very positive story on that front has accelerated the model quite a bit. There's just, again, some comparison issues that we'll just have to realize and perhaps look at a 2-year compound annual growth rate for a period of time to judge where we are on that progress because there's been a lot of ins and outs, especially with Prime Day moving around. So hopefully that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju : Thank you so much. Brian, it seems like the pandemic has touched off what looks like a greater urgency among SMBs to accelerate their presence online, and I was wondering if your third-party marketplaces' platform is seeing perhaps a faster influx of more sellers or emerging brands. And following up on the labor market commentary there, do you think you will see any incremental headwinds hiring the necessary people for performance centers this year? Thanks. Dave Fildes : Stephen, it's Dave. I'll take that first question just around SMBs and behavior. I think, look, it's -- we've seen a 20-year progression in terms of building out the services that we thought were resonated with us and our business, but also saw very early on to externalize those services and offerings to sellers and particularly, small-medium size businesses over time.  Obviously, noteworthy with FBA and many other features. And so I think this -- what you see is really just a continuation of that effort put out by the teams around, whether it's logistics, brand representation. More recently. in recent years with some of the advertising features, we've been able to develop surface, for all our selling partners. And so I think that's a big area and a big part of commitment.  I don't know that I [Indiscernible] anything specifically in the near term other than to say that we should continue to see great momentum on a units basis as we give that metric every quarter, about 56% of our overall total paid units, are third-party. That's up about 300 basis points year-over-year. So, expect for us to continue to put forth that effort in FBA around the world. for sellers and some of these other SMB features continue to gain momentum there. Brian Olsavsky : And on the labor comment, we can't predict too far in the future. We've got labor estimate in our Q3 guidance, I would say it's a bit of a complicated mix of economic growth and industries opening up, government payments in some areas that may impact people's working, and then whether or not children are at back at school fully in the fall. So there's a lot of dynamics we do count on having more employees in Q3 and Q4, as you know, from our ramp up to the holidays. So I would I would probably count on wage pressure remaining for the immediate future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP. Please proceed with your question. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on just international operating income. that's -- if you look at the results, it's now producing consistently positive results here. And so can you talk to us a little bit more? Just talk to us a little bit more about what's driving that. Is this the result of most major builds are now complete, and you're seeing the efficiencies in fulfillment centers, and so we should see this trend continue or is there something else that's driving international operating income? Just remaining positive here. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Ron, thanks for your question. Yes, we have had strong international results in the last five quarters or so. Noticeably, the positive operating income, which had not been the trend prior to Q2 of last year. I would say the major factors here are the acceleration of growth, so we've in some ways put the set 2 years out - growth on top of today's assets. That's a lot of stress, but it's a lot of leverage of the assets that we have.  And as we've talked about before, our fulfillment centers and operations have been running pretty much at peak since May of last year. It's starting to mitigate a bit, but it's a strong undercurrent. But having said that, we continue to invest in international expansion. You may have noticed that we added Portugal as a Prime country last quarter. We have investments in Brazil, and India, and the Middle East and a number of countries. So we continue to add new countries.  We have a strong performance in our more established countries like Europe and Japan. And so it's a bit of a mixed bag, but right now, again, the performance is very strong. The foreign exchange rate has been favorable as well last few quarters. So that has helped. But really pleased with the performance of our international teams.  And we'll see again it -- our investment plans -- our plans are to make money, obviously in the long run. But we have forward advanced Prime benefits in a lot of these countries before they would have been able to see them. and if they have run the same trajectory as we did in the U.S. so there's bit of forward investment on Prime benefits, especially things like video, that resonate with customers and are good for the Prime program, and turn into eventually really strong businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. So maybe one on Amazon then a follow-up. So Amazon -- sorry, AWS. So you saw 10% sequential growth in the quarter, you saw that also in the fourth duarter, was there anything around reopening that made second quarter AWS exceptionally strong and that we should kind of keep in mind going forward, or do we feel like this was kind of a normal quarter for kind of AWS and this is a kind of a good cadence for the business. And then just a follow-up, just -- maybe your your point about the ability to kind of keep up. Is there any kind of throttling of FBA that's going on, just because you don't have the capacity or to -- or you are trying to say that you might be losing share to other sellers who can promise to get an item to customers faster, given still some of the challenges with logistics and last mile and everything. Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Hi, Jason. Thank you. Let me start with that second question. No, my comments were really about throttling of space last year which did impact -- it impacted our vendors and our retail business as well as our third-party business, probably more pronounced in Q2 of last year, especially April and into early May as we are working to get fully staffed in a help -- helpful and safe way, and also build out more capacity.  In Q4, again, we're handling volumes that were somewhat unheard of year-over-year. Our Q4 growth rate was 42%. That's usually not the case, and it's magnified at peak when we're already handling the highest volumes of the year. All I was trying to say was that our space planning and if you will, throttling of space for their price was not something we like to do. We don't think we're the only ones who had that issue. And that's why we're building out our networks so quickly in our minds. It's hard to do quickly. but we're moving as quickly as possible. And again, we have a lot of new capacity being added in the second half of the year. On AWS growth, if you look at the run rate in last year, we had 33% growth rate in Q1 and it dropped to 29, 29, and 28 the last 3 quarters.  There's always a lot of year-over-year things going on, but we do note that last year there was a lot of effort by companies to limit their spend and operate more efficiently as as we're all plunged into an unknown demand curve and some industries who were hurt worse than others. If you remember, we worked -- we actually worked very hard with our customers to help them lower their demand for AWS services as best we could to match any new demand patterns. We also help [Indiscernible] scale very quickly. Companies like [Indiscernible], Netflix and others were very help -- glad that AWS was there to help them scale to meet volume very quickly, so there's a lot of mixed bag there.  We think that it was a strong performance for this quarter. We can see good trends with new contracts and new clients that are either signing up with AWS and making the journey to the Cloud or accelerating their journey to the Cloud, or setting up new longer-term contracts with us. Operator : Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post : Great. A couple. No one's really mentioned the CEO change. So I was wondering if it is not on the call but any change in direction, investment philosophies, or any -- more integration of AWS, or anything that we should be aware of related to that change? And then second, AWS margins, really strong revenues. The margins came down quarter-over-quarter. Can you just remind us of what drives some of that margin fluctuation? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with the second one. So again, at any point in time, there's a lot of cross pressures in the operating margins of AWS. There's growth which helps us leverage our assets. There's increasing the efficiency of our servers and efficiency of our sales force. Those are all positives. On the flipside, there's price decreases, there's new contracts signed with large players for multiple years. So there's pricing pressure. There's also the expansion of the sales force and building infrastructure to add new regions globally.  So as we said, these margins are going to bounce around. We're happy with the Q2 margins. I would note that there was a negative impact from foreign exchange that was about 150 basis points. But even at 28.3, it's a strong margin for this business. We know it's going to bounce around as we invest, but also worked very hard to scale our businesses in and efficiently run our assets. on the leadership change.  It's your -- expect Andy, he's hit the ground, running. He's continuing to have a very high bar for customer experience. high standards, operational excellence, inventiveness, willingness to fail, and everything else that Amazon is known for internally and externally. I think we've had a good handoff. Jeff, of course, is moving into Executive Chairman role and he will not be leaving.  He is obviously continuing to be very involved in, as we say, the 1-way door decisions. We've also had a good leadership change at AWS with Adam Selipsky coming in. Adam himself comes with a lot of Amazon history and knowledge and external CEO experience that has made him even stronger as he comes back.  So we feel really good about the transition. And of course, don't expect any drop and expect Andy to add his unique brand of positive attitude and optimism in forward-looking focus to help Amazon keep going and delighting customers. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 28t, 2021 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining us today. Let me first start by reiterating and expanding on a few comments that Andy made in our earnings release. We are now reporting our results for the seventh quarter since the pandemic began and we're especially proud of our employees for both their response to the unprecedented customer demand we have experienced, as well as for their implementation of many safety procedures to create a safe work environment. During this period, we have continued to earn the trust of our customers, especially our Prime members, who have increased their annual purchases and their use of Prime benefits over the last 20 months. We've also seen strong growth in our advertising products, as vendors and sellers have embraced our ability to build their brands and to reach customers just as they are considering their purchases. And AWS has seen a reacceleration of revenue growth as customers have expanded their commitment to the cloud and selected AWS as their cloud partner. As a result, Amazon 's Q3 revenue of $110.8 billion represented a two-year compounded annual growth rate of 25% versus a pre-pandemic growth rate in the low 20% range. We're grateful to our customers who have put their trust in us. However, there have certainly been challenges to overcome since February of last year. We've nearly doubled our operations capacity in the past two years to keep up with customer demand. We've incurred billions of dollars in additional cost to keep our employees safe and to support testing and other COVID-related costs. And we have grown our global headcount by 628,000 employees in the past 18 months and are recruiting for more, including more than 150,000 in the U.S. to support Q4 seasonal demand. This demand for labor has recently coincided with the shortage of available workers, particularly in the United States. It began in Q2, but it really started to impact our operations and cost structure in Q3. It's led to wage increases and sign-on incentives, as companies compete for workers, as well as inconsistent staffing levels in our operations. In addition, disruption to the global supply chains and inflation in the cost of materials such as steel and services such as trucking have also raised our cost of operations. We estimate the cost of labor, labor-related productivity losses, and cost inflation to have added approximately $2 billion in operating costs in Q3, particularly in August and September. Our Q4 guidance range anticipates that these costs will approach $4 billion in Q4 as we see a full quarter's impact of these effects and a higher seasonal unit volume. Specify in Q3, we saw nearly $1 billion of inflationary pressures, primarily tied to wage increases and incentives in our operations. Our average starting wage is now over $18 per hour, with an additional $3 per hour depending on shifts in many locations and sign-on bonuses that can be up to $3,000. In addition, we saw inflationary pressures in raw materials and services, as I mentioned, particularly in steel and third-party trucking. We also saw over $1 billion of cost tied to loss productivity and disruption in our operations. In Q3, labor became our primary capacity constraint, not storage space or fulfillment capacity. As a result, inventory placement was frequently redirected to fulfillment centers to have the labor to receive the products. This resulted in less optimal placement, which leads to longer and more expensive transportation routes. In short, our operations are normally well-staffed and optimized to be in-stock and to deliver to customers in one to two days. Labor shortages in supply chain disruptions upset this balance and resulted in additional costs to ensure that we continue to maintain our service levels to customers. As you look to Q4, we've incorporated this nearly $4 billion of added costs into our operating income guidance range. In addition, we have a nearly $1 billion year-over-year increase in Q4 for spend to support our digital media content efforts, including video, music, and games. We recently launched New World, a multiplayer online PC game, and we're delighted with the response and engagement. New World has become the highest played new game this year on Steam. Moving to video content. Prime Video has a compelling lineup of live sports, including the UEFA Champions League and Ligue 1 soccer in France, as well as NFL Thursday Night Football in the United States. And we have a great lineup of original series to look forward to, including the Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and Citadel and new seasons from Jack Ryan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Boys. We're excited to add this content to our Prime benefits and increase the value of our Prime membership. Q4's guidance also includes an estimated $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes in Q4 of last year, and then our fulfillment centers were running at close to 100% capacity as we work to add physical capacity to match demand. As we're now back to having more normal Q4 fulfillment capacity and have even brought forward 2022 capacity into 2021, our operating leverage drops compared with last Q4. Our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the current trends we are seeing, including the lapping of our Prime Day Event in October of last year. We are dealing with labor risks and supply chain interruptions like many other companies, which increases our range of potential outcomes in Q4. Consumers have started to return to pre-pandemic spending patterns, increasing the mobility and spending more on travel and services in Q2 and Q3. But we're appreciative that the incremental demand that came our way during the pandemic has remained and that we're continuing to grow on top of that. We're all set to make this a great holiday season for customers. Last quarter, we discussed the physical capacity we were adding to meet customer demand. We made strong progress in Q3 to build and open new facilities. And as a result, for the first time since the pandemic began, we're no longer capacity constrained for fiscal space in the network. September alone, we brought online more than 100 new buildings in the United States, including fulfillment centers, source centers, and last-mile delivery stations. For the year, we expect our 2021 footprint additions to exceed last year's buildout, which was also significant. Put this in perspective, we are on track to double our fulfillment network over the two-year period since the pandemic's early days. A lot of this increased capacity supports our FBA sellers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offerings for customers, representing 56% of total paid units sold in Q3, that's up from 54% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, a U.S. conference for selling partners, where we introduce new tools and capabilities, including local selling, which enables sellers to start or expand their multichannel offerings by providing both in-store pickup and fast delivery to nearby customers and global selling tools to make it easier for U.S. third-party sellers to offer their products worldwide. I'll finish with a few highlights regarding two fast-growing areas with strong profitability profiles. First, we saw continuation of strong usage and revenue growth in AWS, with revenues accelerating to 39% year-over-year in Q3, driven by a broad base of services and customers. There are number of areas we're excited about, but let's focus for a moment on our efforts in machine learning. Customers of all sizes and across all industries are using AWS as their preferred cloud provider for machine learning services. We've been investing in this area for several years, offering an extensive set of machines learning services, including ones that can be applied to common business problems, like Amazon Connect for contact center intelligence, or Amazon Kendra for intelligent enterprise search. We recently launched solutions specific to industries, including industrial machine learning services, as well as Amazon Health Lake to help healthcare and life sciences customers seamlessly transform their data across disparate sources to understand and extract meaningful medical information. And Amazon SageMaker continues to help customers scale their use of machine learning to core workloads, making it one of the fastest-growing services in AWS history, with tens of thousands of active external customers using it every month. We also continue to see strong interest in rapid adoption of our custom silicon and AWS design Graviton2 processors, delivering customers up to 40% better price performance than current X86 processors. Moving to Graviton2 means little to no code changes, so that customers can quickly and easily migrate their workloads to access the best price performance in Amazon EC2. Last but certainly not least, Amazon Advertising continues to grow quickly, representing the significant majority of other revenue, which grew 49% year-over-year in Q3. We're seeing strong adoption across Amazon vendors, sellers, and authors, as well as brands that don't sell in our store, particularly as we've built out our streaming TV offerings. Of course, advertising only works if we make it useful for customers. And when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. The team also recently hosted unboxed 2021, our annual conference for advertisers and brands, where we shared some of our newest solutions to help companies connect with their customers, measure the impact of their advertising, and grow their businesses. As we shift into Q4, we're heads down, focused on delivering a great experience for our customers this holiday season. We are committed to make the necessary investments in both people and capacity to bring more items in stock and to deliver them quickly to customers. With that, let's move on to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post : Great. Maybe I will ask about fulfillment capacity. You said your capacity is up 2x since before the pandemic and I've got units up around 55% on a two-year basis. So just wondering, is the capacity needed per unit going up as you speed up delivery times and try to get to one day? And then second, are you in really good shape for next year? And could you be ahead of plan for next year and kind of cut down the investment there? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Hi, Justin. On your first question about whether we've \u2013 the comparison of doubling the fulfillment capacity to the unit growth. Keep in mind also that our fulfillment capacity also includes our transportation delivery capacity. And in the last two years, we've also greatly ratcheted up our ability to deliver ourselves through NCL, and our percent of units that we deliver through MCL is over 50% of our units globally. So that's a big -- that's a driver as well. I'd also say that while we've been chasing really demand for last two years, we've been doing it is, as I said, we're running about 100%, pretty much all of last year. We are just now getting caught up on space for inventory and inventory is being brought in to support the holiday. And if you look year-over-year, while units growth is, as you say, closer to 8% in Q3, the cubic -- inventory cube is up closer to 40%, both in North America and internationally. So, there's like the second shoe that's dropping of getting the fulfillment centers back in stock, especially for sellers and especially as we head into holiday. So that's a -- I think that capacity, the amount of space we have for inventory is also going up probably at a higher rate than our unit ship right now. Your question about whether it pulls forward from next year, we're not forecasting into next year. We do see that we will -- we expect growth, and as I mentioned on the last call, we think that the growth will be suppressed for the four quarters that end middle of Q2 next year, but we expect -- just as a comp versus 2020 just because of the 40% growth we saw last year. But we expect the long- term trends to be strong in this business. We're investing in such -- as I mentioned, the two-year CAGRs, I do that just so you can kind of judge pre-pandemic versus today. We see strong growth even off a base of last year, which was strong. So, we'll see next year on CapEx, and certainly for the foreseeable future, our capacity constraint is actually labor, which is new and not welcome. That's what we've tried to articulate here today. And we are hoping that that rectifies itself through Q4 and into early 2022. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : Great. Two questions. First, any color around those international losses in the quarter that was large achievement by Amazon standards, that $900 million? And then secondly, talk about the - you've been spending -- so you've doubled this fulfillment capacity. I think they're really kind of catch up to demand, but now I think like you're getting ahead of it. And as you roll out, you get close to one-day promise that you worked up two or three years ago pre-pandemic, and as you start rolling out, super same-day delivery or what you call sub one-day delivery. Talk about the incremental demand, do you think that that could unlock into the extensive which you're investing against not only to catch up to demand, but trying to liberate future demand if you get my point? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. I definitely do, and I'm glad you brought that up because I didn't include it in my last answer. But yes, we have unfinished business on the one-day promise side. We were ramping that up nicely in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic. We're still not back to levels that we saw pre-pandemic. We're getting closer. We feel again that labor constraints have not helped us close the gap there. But we don't want to be as good as -- just as good as we were before the pandemic. We expect that to increase in 2022, and we're going to plan accordingly. And I think you start to see the difference in the growth rate before and after that one day. I won't forecast it too much, but we do -- we did see pick-up and we saw really that we got into the consideration set for more purchases. When something's available in one day or less, now you really don't have to go to a store even if you need it very quickly. So, it just opens up more ways for us to serve our customers, especially our Prime customers. On your comment about international, yes, you're right, it was a larger loss than in prior quarters. In fact, we had flipped to positive operating income through the pandemic. A lot of that was again getting two years of volume growth on top of a one-year's -- current year cost structure. There's also a bit of a slowdown just in content and other things, although we're building that, we would have built it at a higher clip. But the long-term trends remain the same in international. It's a group that has a very different life -- we're in different stages in different countries. The established countries of Europe and Japan are further along, obviously, and they perform closer to the North America results. We have new countries. We've added a lot in the last few years, the investments in Brazil, the Middle East, Australia, and adjacent countries of Poland and Sweden within Europe. So those are all important investments, but they start as an investment. And they -- we build over time and we front-load a lot of Prime benefits in those countries, especially things like video. We find video as a really strong, excuse me, attractor of customers and it's a gateway to Prime in a lot of those countries. So, the model is a bit flipped as versus what we saw in North America, just because we added video later in the game. But we like what we see and we see the actual the hours watched in the percent of Prime members who watch video is actually higher in a lot of the countries, the new countries that we're getting into. So, we're - as we said, we're going to make money long-term in international. Right now, it's a bit of an umbrella that catches a lot of different countries in different stages. We're happy with both the established countries. They are also seeing, however, the pressures that we're seeing in United States on labor and cost and disruption from supply chains. So, can't forecast this any further at the segment level, but just want to give you a little color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Brian, just curious, how have you fared in pulling holiday shopping earlier thus far this quarter? And to what degree can that help ease some of the impact? And perhaps, what did you learn there last year from having Prime Day in 4Q? And then can you just also talk a little bit about the drivers of AWS acceleration and how you think about the margin profile with more contribution from enterprise deals? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Yes. Let's start with the holiday shopping. So yes, you're right. Last year, we -- as we look back, we used Prime Day to pull a lot of holiday shopping forward. And people knew that delivery capacity across all retailers was going to be tight, so it was more distributed to the quarter. Obviously, that works better for us than to have it all hit in a few concentrated weeks around Cyber Monday and Black Friday and the week before and two weeks after. So operationally, it's easier to perform when the volume is spread out. You are seeing a lot of promotional activity from us in October. Again, trying to do what we did last year, just pulled some demand to get people to buy and to buy early. We think that's to their advantage. Although we're preparing to serve people throughout the whole quarter, we feel we've done a good job of lining up inventory commitments that are larger than normal. We've looked at getting more container capacity. We've been successful in that. We've accessed new ports and parts of entry into U.S. So, we're doing everything we can, granted it's at a cost penalty in many cases, but we are -- we feel good about being able to serve customers this Q4. Love it in October, but we will take it in November and December as well. On AWS, the acceleration, I would -- again, I would say that what we're seeing is, again, a lot of customers accelerate their journey to cloud based on the pandemic. Some of their spending was suppressed in 2020 as they -- it's different, some companies were booming. Disney, Zoom, Netflix, others that were more travel-related were suppressed in their demand. Then I think there's a general level of recovery across a lot of our customer base. We're expanding our customer base into a lot of different areas, a lot of new different customers. We add many new products. I highlighted a few of our machine learning products, so we feel really good about the acceleration in growth. We know there were some suppression last year, but it was -- the growth last year was still in the 28% to 32% - or excuse me, 28% to 33% range through on an FX-neutral basis through most of the year. On the margin side, the margins are going to be -- they're not going to fluctuate over time. There's a lot of moving parts. There is a lot of extensions of contracts and long-term commitments, which are great for our business and great for customers. So, there's negotiated long-term deals, there's also a lot of investment in new capacity in new regions to service high usage. We're certainly adding -- continuing to add to our sales force and marketing teams. And then the counterbalance on that is how well we run our data centers, what efficiencies we get, what cost reductions we get. So, it's always going to be varying. We like where we are and will not forecast forward. But again, they are apt to change, but we're working hard to keep them high and well passing through benefits and efficiencies to customers in lower pricing. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, Brian. The first one, I wanted to kind of ask a big picture question about the retail business. I know there's a lot of extra costs sort of moving through the system now, but maybe can you just talk to us, big picture about any changes or factors that have changed the Company's view about the long-term profitability, the long-term return on invested capital of the retail business now, as opposed to at the end of 2019? Then the second one is on the physical stores. You have quite a few different formats and experiments going on in the physical stores. Talk to us about areas where you've seen sort of the most positive results from physical stores, where you're pleased as opposed to areas where you still see room for improvement in the physical store strategy. Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with your comment on the, we'll call it the core retail business. We're very bullish on the retail business. In fact, it's impossible and not productive to even try and separate advertising from third-party from retail. It's all, to us, part of a flywheel where we service customers. We do it in an efficient way and we earn their trust in their future business, and we fight that battle every day. And we look to expand the Prime program to build that flywheel. We look to add new products and services like grocery and video and music and the list is long. So, when you look at retail, certainly expensive right now, especially with the costs I\u2019ve laid out in Q3 and Q4, for us to service that business. However, we have other monetization vehicles, including advertising that if we do well, become a benefit to customers and to advertisers at the same time. That's what we work on. So that is an important part of our profitability structure. It's tied directly to happy customers and customers who are engaged in buying things. So, we don't separate those two. We do for some reasons. We want to make sure that we're understanding where our cost and where our profits happen to be. But we do realize it's all part of the same customer offering. So \u2013 and we like the return on investment flywheel. We do. We - I get to see investments in warehouses trucking programs, new offerings that we do in new country expansion. We segment those as much as we can into discrete decisions. And then we track them and make sure that not only are we delighting customers or delighting shareholders in the long-term. So, we feel good about that. Certainly, the cost of fulfillment in the last few months and what we forecast into the next quarter are not what we're happy about, but we see ourselves as the shock absorber, absorbing a lot of the costs, so that the customers not impacted and sellers are not impacted. And again, it's just quite limited options in the short run to impact your cost structure. Most companies would delay shipment or incur -- add fees or something. We don't think that is customer-centric nor productive. And we will get through this period and then we are committed to getting our cost structure down. Dave Fildes : And Brian, on that second question around the physical store strategy. We - of course, we have a number of different brands in store types, Whole Foods being the largest that's got over 500 locations, where we've got Amazon 4-star, Amazon Books, the Fresh Grocery stores, Amazon Go and Amazon Pop Ups. And each one of course has a name and the types of products they offer has its own differences. But I think when you step back, we've said that we want options for customers to be able to shop online and in-store. And I think you're seeing that probably most predominantly with the grocery offerings in the Whole Foods footprint that we've got out there. And we want to give customers choice and offer them the combination doing that online and in-store option, whatever works best. And the goal around this is really raise the bar for what customers can expect with this omni-channel experience. So, if you like the hybrid model and we're working on continuing to evolve on a lot of interesting in-store experiences that will resonate with customers. We know that customers like to have a choice to be able to do that. So, some of the things that we continue to be excited about and do a lot of work on are things like the Just Walk Out Technology, that's been in our Amazon Go stores and has now moved into some of our Amazon Fresh stores, just really eliminates, again, one of those things that people may not realize is such a hassle or a deterrent to shopping, waiting in line, and eliminating something that\u2019s really been positively received by customers as they use that technology. Another one, just as you enter these stores, there's technology we have now in a little over 70 of our physical retail stores like Amazon One, which is a contactless way for folks to enter stores using their palm to identify. So that's in, as I said, retail stores and Whole Foods stores. And so, keep looking for us to roll that out. And I\u2019d say with these technologies, too, there's opportunities beyond the Amazon physical store footprints that I mentioned. You're starting to see Just Walk Out going in sports and kind of large arena-type environments. And Amazon One is at some good locations. And both those technologies, I'm excited to employ them in Climate Pledge Arena here in Seattle. So, look for us to keep iterating on those and finding other new innovative ways for customers to enjoy unique shopping experience. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can come back to two on the Q4 cost structure. Just in terms of framing it almost against a year-ago period, could you talk a little bit about the 4 billion of COVID costs from a year ago, the elements of EBIT contribution from things like AWS and third-party and advertising, and maybe help investors better understand the bridge between some of the elements of headwinds to profitability in Q4 versus Q4 a year ago. I appreciate all the comments upfront. I didn't know if we could go a little bit deeper. And then of the costs you're incurring late Q3 into Q4, how should investors think about a permanent nature to that cost structure versus a transient nature of the cost structure, either as an output of the macro environment or the unit environment in Q4? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Eric, for your questions. I will just start with the second one. So how should we think about the cost permanence? Certainly, on the labor front there, we estimate about half of the cost is permanent base wage. The other half is in incentives that we currently offer to attract workers. We're going to have to see. I think it's going to adjust -- we are going to have to adjust and work to lower our costs going forward, especially on things that we procure that may have gone up in price in the last few months. Mostly what I\u2019m talking about is kind of third-party things like trucking and steel for fulfillment center construction. So, we will be working on our cost structure for a while. If you're trying to do the bridge for Q4 year-over-year, a couple of things I would say, yes, the COVID costs are lower by $1.5 billion versus last year. Eric Sheridan : Q3, yes. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. If your Q4, excuse me, the 4 billion is going to be pure variance year-over-year. That's what we've identified, 2 billion roughly of labor inflation and 2 billion of operational disruption mostly through higher transportation costs. There are a couple of other items year-over-year. If you remember last year, we were running at nearly 100% capacity. That's not the ideal for us, but it has the benefit of being highly leveraged and can have other costs, but it's highly leveraged mathematically on a cost per unit shipped. As we get more into a normal buffer, so that we can handle swings in volumes, especially as we get closer to holiday cutoffs, but we generally run with more slack in the system. And we\u2019re kind of in a good fortunate for returning to maybe a more normal profile and space, this Q4 issues again on labor. So there's that. There's the increased cost in digital content, combination of video, games, music, audible. So, some rather large items year-over-year, having given you a complete bridge, but that's what we're seeing. Dave Fildes : Yeah. I think that's right, $4 billion, the items you mentioned, $1 billion higher in content. Marketing costs, they were suppressed last year. For much of the year, you're starting to see those grow throughout 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Dan Salmon : Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. First, you mentioned growing customers use of Prime, more original programming coming, and the services you offer, continuing to expand. Do you see this demand, this new content, the new services having expanded to a point where a price increase for the Prime subscription begins to make sense? And then second, you mentioned the unboxed event earlier this week, number of new ad products announced there. Which among them do you expect to be most impactful to the overall advertising business? Thanks, guys. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Dan. I\u2019m going to start with the first question on Prime. So yes, we're very excited about the current programming that\u2019s coming out in the back-end of this year, and also the prospect for 2022. We think it's a real step-up in options and quality and volume for our customers globally in the video side and very excited about it. And you're right, it does have a lot of value. I've nothing to discuss or announce around Prime price increases. But we always look at that. We look at the value where it's generally a country-by-country discussion. We look at the value we\u2019ve built. We look at the time since our last price increase. There\u2019s a lot of strategic factors involved obviously. But the main job is to build the value of Prime, and that's what we work on and video is a big part of that. Dave Fildes : Yes. And, Dan, on the second piece for advertising, I think, we still see there's a lot of opportunity in the biggest kind of bucket, if you will, of the current advertising revenue run rate. And that's in the sponsored activity that we're able to offer up to customers, continuing to find ways to just measure that information and be able to surface it credibly and quickly improve on that for advertisers out there. So, a lot of work and it's still being done on the team there and being able to add value for customers. I\u2019d point to, there's a lot of excitement in the of video advertising area, I know we've talked about that in the past. It's growing quickly. It's not the biggest piece of that run rate that you see in there, but growing well. And I think just the technology, we're able to develop some of the relationships that we've been able to foster with things like live sports, the opportunities with the Fire TV device and the video community and where we can reach folks through those areas, it's really exciting. IMDb TV, our ad-supported channel is - continues to do really well. People really enjoy that. We recently expanded that beyond the U.S. for the first time to the UK. So, a lot of really good and interesting ideas and a lot of opportunities to grow in different ways with video. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Just two for me. So, you guys are always kind of beating the rest of e-commerce on speed of delivery across a wide set of SKUs, but there's a bunch of these new companies cropping up that are wiring up speedy same-day delivery for a lot of products from either their own warehouse or from various other retailers. Do you view that as a threat? And you have same-day offering in 15 cities. Does your same-day leverage kind of your existing fulfillment center footprint or do you have to kind of rethink the approach to get the speed down to that 30-minute window or wherever it's going to go? And the second question is just New World was a huge hit. So just any thoughts high-level on the overall strategy within gaming? Thanks. Dave Fildes : Yeah. I'll take the second question first related to games. So, I think as we mentioned at the top, really excited to get New World out there to more customers' hands and saw some really good momentum kind of an engagement coming out of the gate with customers there and some of the offerings like the Steam platform and Twitch as well. But if you step back, I think, look, we've said for a while now that gaming is obviously one of the fastest-growing industries in the entertainment space. And we find and see a number of different ways to be able to offer some folks a variety of services. So, we developed and published games for customers through Amazon Games, which developed that New World. We're also leveraging the Flywheel -- the Amazon Flywheel, offering some exclusive and free content as part of Prime Gaming, so it\u2019s part of Prime benefits. You've got AWS, utilizing AWS servers to stream games with our Luna -- Amazon Luna offering. And then as I mentioned before, building this large, engaged, passionate gaming community online with Twitch. So, I think, again, kind of to my point about a lot of really interesting ideas when we're talking about video and the advertising space, it's a lot of different areas that can interrelate, serve different communities within the gaming area. And so, we're going to keep working on that, keep building and listening to customers on the games we've launched, and keep pushing forward with an exciting slate in the future. Brian Olsavsky : And then your first question on what I'll call ultra-fast delivery and other options in the market. We like our model. It's a rapidly evolving space. And obviously, we\u2019re customer-obsessed, but we also are competitor aware. We like the business that we have. We have over 170,000 products that customers, Prime customers can get within two hours from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and other stores that participate with us in over 5,000 cities and towns. So, we're well on our way to providing ultra-fast delivery for things that require ultra-fast, or things like groceries and others. And we see that expanding, but there will be room for multiple winners in the space. And as we say, there's -- you have to have a cost structure and a logistics network that will pay for the delivery over time. So, we see it as part of an offering that we offer to customers that ranges from two days to one day to two hours or one hour, in some cases. So, we like to meet customers where they are and when they need things, and we're working on speed consistently. Operator : Our final question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brent Thill : Thanks. On the advertising business, I'm curious, given some of the concerns in the supply chain, have you seen a pullback on the ad side? So far, is that something that you're factoring in for the fourth quarter? Brian Olsavsky : No. We're actually -- again, we're seeing strong growth. Obviously, the Prime Day is always a really great advertising event as well. And then you saw a little bit of that in Q2 when we had Prime Day in Q2 this year and we're lapping Prime Day from Q4 of last year. So, there might be comparable issues, but as far as the strength of the offering and the differential between the growth of the advertising business versus the unit growth, we think we're really resonating with advertisers. We're given new products, new ways to advertise, new ways to highlight the brands. It\u2019s resonating with sellers as well for the same reasons. And we feel it's additive to the customer experience. It helps customers find curated selection and also see brands that they may not have otherwise seen. Dave Fildes Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, February 3, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by once again acknowledging and thanking our employees around the world for their efforts. This was the second holiday season during this pandemic, and it required exceptional collaboration and coordination among our employees and business partners to prioritize both safety and customer experience. The team did a great job of delivering for customers this holiday. Now, let\u2019s discuss our fourth quarter financial results. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $137.4 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to focus on offering the best experience for our customers across our businesses. On the consumer side, we welcomed millions of new Prime members in both the United States and international during the quarter, while continuing to see consistently high member renewal rates across geographies. Our third-party sellers, in particular, benefited from strong customer demand this holiday season. 3P sellers provided 56% of all unit sales in the quarter, the highest fourth quarter mix ever. And AWS saw a continuation of the strong usage and revenue growth we\u2019ve seen throughout 2021. AWS added more revenue year-over-year than any quarter in its history, and it\u2019s now a $71 billion annualized run rate business, up from $51 billion run rate one year ago. Even on a large base, revenue increased 40% year-over-year. As I\u2019ve mentioned in prior calls, we also encourage you to look at the multiyear compounded annual revenue growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this revenue growth in perspective. Despite lapping 2020\u2019s extraordinary sales growth, we continue to see an increase in customer demand and sales during the remainder of 2021, even as the economy opened back up. For Q4, Amazon\u2019s two-year annual compounded growth rate was 25%, excluding impacts from foreign exchange, consistent with our rate in the third quarter. We\u2019ve invested significantly to keep pace with this demand, including nearly doubling our operations capacity in the past two years, expanding our fulfillment center footprint while adding significant transportation assets to ensure fast on-time delivery. There are now 1.6 million Amazon employees worldwide, also doubling in the two-year period. Our fourth quarter operating income was $3.5 billion. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we did see more than $4 billion in costs from inflationary pressures and loss productivity and disruption in our operations. The inflation primarily relates to wage increases and incentives in our operations as well as higher pricing from third-party carriers supporting our fulfillment network. Loss productivity and network disruptions were driven primarily by labor capacity constraints due to challenges in staffing up our facilities for peak. This is driven by the very tight labor market in the second half of 2021 and more recently by the emergence of the Omicron variant. We do expect these cost challenges to persist into Q1, albeit adjusted for lower seasonal volumes relative to the fourth quarter. Our results also include approximately $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes for most of 2020 and the first half of 2021 and that fulfillment network was running at close to 100% capacity during this time. Now with more normal fulfillment capacity, our operating leverage decreases versus the comparable prior year periods. We expect to continue to see some negative year-over-year impact from this in Q1 of 2022. While we navigate these near-term headwinds, the fundamentals of our retail business are strong and we are optimistic about a number of growth businesses and a strong innovation pipeline. AWS delivered another strong quarter of growth as enterprises and developers continue to look to AWS for critical innovative cloud solutions. Now to $71 billion annualized revenue run rate, AWS revenue grew 40% year-over-year in Q4, our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth rate acceleration. We hosted our 10th re :Invent conference in the quarter, welcoming 26,000 in-person attendees and hundreds of thousands who attended virtually. re:Invent remains a highlight of the year for us because it\u2019s a great opportunity to introduce new services while engaging with customers and partners to better inform where we should be focusing next. We announced more than 115 new services and features during the event as businesses spanning all major industries continue to choose AWS as their technology provider to speed up innovation in their organizations. In the past quarter alone, NASDAQ announced a multiyear partnership to migrate North America markets to AWS, including their matching engine. Best Buy selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for cloud infrastructure services. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp selected AWS as its long-term strategic cloud provider to accelerate artificial intelligence research and development. And Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Ram selected AWS as its preferred global cloud provider for vehicle platforms to accelerate new digital products and upskill global workforce. You can find more examples in our earnings release of how the world\u2019s largest companies such as Adidas, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Rivian and more are using AWS to transform their businesses. Overall net income was $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter. While we normally focus our comments on operating income, I\u2019d point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $11.8 billion related to our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, which completed its initial public offering in November. Before we move to Q&A, there are three additional items I\u2019ll mention related to our disclosures. First, we are now separating advertising services revenue from other revenue as part of our revenue disclosures by groups of similar products and services. This updated presentation is provided in the supplemental financial information included in our earnings release. We\u2019re excited to continue innovating in areas like sponsored ads, streaming video and measurement. Of course, advertising only works so we make it useful for Amazon customers when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. Second, we\u2019re prospectively updating the useful life of our servers and networking equipment, beginning in January. As a practice, we monitor and review the useful lives of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. We are increasing the useful life for servers from four years to five years and network equipment from five years to six years. As a result, our first quarter guidance includes an approximate $1 billion of lower depreciation expense. We expect the quarterly impact of this change to decrease throughout the year. Although we\u2019re calling out an accounting change here, this really reflects a tremendous team effort by AWS to make our server and network equipment last longer. We\u2019ve been operating at scale for over 15 years, and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. This then lowers stress on the hardware and extends the useful life, both for the assets that we use to support AWS\u2019 external customers as well as those used to support our own internal Amazon businesses. And finally, we will increase the price of Prime in the United States in Q1. We continue to make Prime better. In recent years, we\u2019ve added more product selection available with fast free unlimited shipping, more exclusive deals and discounts, and more high-quality entertainment, including TV, movies, music and books. Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals. And this September, Prime Video will also release the highly anticipated the Lord of The Rings : The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of an historic 11-year agreement with the National Football League. Since 2018 in the U.S., availability of same-day delivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90. Items available for Prime free shipping have increased over 50%. And members have saved billions of dollars shopping on Prime days. It\u2019s all on top of new program benefits like prescription savings and fast free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy and the continually growing Amazon Music catalog for Prime members as well as Prime Reading and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits, and the increased member usage that we\u2019ve seen as well as the rise in wages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the United States with the monthly price going from $12.99 to $14.99 and the annual membership going from $119 to $139. This is our first price increase since 2018. For new Prime members, the price change will go into effect on February 18th. For current Prime members, the new price will apply after March 25th on the date of their next renewal. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will open up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the comments in the release by Andy on same-day delivery. Can you talk a little bit about how many of those investments might be behind you versus ahead of you with respect to same-day delivery and how that sets the Company up with respect to either consumption behavior by consumers versus the competitive dynamic you\u2019re seeing against elements of like omnichannel and last-mile delivery competitors? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Hi Eric, sure thing. So, on same-day, again, there\u2019s multiple levels of fast shipping here from ultrafast, which is essentially our grocery business in one to two hours to same day and less, and then one-day and two-day Prime. We feel good about where we are. We\u2019re continuing to build capacity that enables us to hit those cutoffs. I think his comments were more around getting us back to our pre-pandemic levels for one-day delivery and improving upon that and then getting same-day to more and more metropolitan areas. We\u2019re doing that globally as well, but we really think that that combination of speed for different product levels -- or product line, excuse me, really resonates with customers. And there\u2019s a lot of new offers for free -- or excuse me, generally free shipping on a fast basis. But we know how hard this is. And our goal is to do it and do it at a price that we can make money on as well and our cost structure commensurate with that. So, that\u2019s where the difficult work comes in, but we like the progress we\u2019ve made developing our Amazon Logistics capability over the last few years. And what we\u2019ve been adding, as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve doubled the capacity in the network over the last two years. That is not all just to handle today\u2019s volume. It\u2019s also to handle getting closer to the customer and being able to ship faster. So, we like where we stand. We know there\u2019s work to do on improving our customer service. We like the progress we\u2019ve been making lately, but we think the future is bright on that dimension. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Brian, the first one, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s changed within the retail business, sort of pre-pandemic, post-pandemic more same-day, more grocery, more last-mile investments in an ad business. Curious to hear, as you sort of -- you think about the long-term profitability of the retail segment, has your view about how you think about long-term profitability or cash flow retail fallen at all post-pandemic because of the higher required investments is the first one? Then the second one, like the new disclosure, I\u2019d be curious for any other disclosure about the number of engineers or the size of the teams you are working on a lot of the innovation that you talked about that are sort of more around early-stage nonrevenue-generating projects, we can better understand that investment in Amazon. Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. On the second one, we have a history of making long-term bets for customers, and some of those fall into very small short-term revenue businesses. They\u2019ll generally roll up into other revenue, which you see as very small after we\u2019ve separated out advertising. So, I think that you do see it in our revenue disclosure generally. But a lot of our profitability is shown at the segment level, and we\u2019ll continue to do that with the revenue disclosure. You asked about the business model. I think it\u2019s a good question. And we are -- as we reflect over the last two years, we are encouraged by a lot of things. You ticked them off there, the adoption of digital benefits, the use of grocery and how valuable that\u2019s become to customers, not to mention the acceleration of companies going to the cloud. The ability to double our fulfillment capacity over that time period, including making major strides in our Amazon Logistics sets us up well for the future. And -- but we\u2019ve been also dealing with a lot of disruption during this time period. So, the early wave of disruption was handling volume without the capacity to handle it, and then, quickly playing catch-up. And as that was starting to improve, labor took a turn in the United States, especially labor availability, and we\u2019ve really had scrambled to add workers. We\u2019ve been successful at it. We added over 273,000 employees in the last half of last year. But I think if you look at the prior year, it was over 400,000. So, there\u2019s a lot of expansion that\u2019s been going on in the network. And we feel good about the basic contributors of profitability. There\u2019s -- if you step back, there\u2019s procurement margin and working with vendors and sellers as well. There\u2019s fees in some cases, for 3P services and Prime, as we just mentioned is going up. Advertising has certainly added a layer of contribution over the last few years. But again, that only works and is only successful if we make it a good customer experience. So, we\u2019re really working hard to do that. And that becomes a part of our ability to offer lower prices, better selection and more convenience. So, if you take those, those are all stable and strengthening areas. It\u2019s really the onus \u2013 our onus is to get our operational efficiency back in all of our areas of cost. We have, again, built a lot of capacity. We\u2019ve hired a lot of people. Some of those people are still -- our teams are all battling Omicron right now. But, we do see the sun coming out and getting better here over the next number of quarters, and that\u2019s going to be where we\u2019re going to put a lot of our effort. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you doubled your fulfillment network and also your headcount over the past two years. I believe you\u2019re about 2.5 years into this investment cycle. Where is Amazon in terms of emerging from this investment cycle? Can you see a slowdown in that big investment spending this year? Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about capital expenditures. And I\u2019m going to do this with the inclusion of equipment finance leases, which is the residual that we sometimes lease on our infrastructure assets. We\u2019re doing less of it now, but we still do some and have done it historically. So, when you look at those numbers and how they\u2019ve grown over the last few years, I\u2019ll give you the proportions, which I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve initially shown before is about 40% -- just under 40% of that CapEx is going into infrastructure, most of it\u2019s feeding AWS, but also certainly, Amazon is a large customer of that as well as we build and structure for ourselves directly or through AWS. About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building out our AMZL network, principally globally. The remaining 5% or so is small things like offices and stores and other capital areas. But those are the three main areas. If I look to the future, we\u2019re still working through some of our plans 2022, but it\u2019s coming into focus a bit. We see the CapEx for infrastructure going up. We still have a very fast-growing business this growing globally, and we\u2019re adding regions and capacity to handle usage that still exceeds revenue growth in that business. So, we feel good about making those investments. On the fulfillment center side, that\u2019s about 30% of the spend in the last two years. We see that moderating and that will probably now match growth of our underlying businesses. I think there\u2019s always things that can tick up that growth rate, things like expansion of our FBA business, expansion of cube that maybe not be different than the square footage. So, there\u2019s -- we want to have capacity to have a healthy retail and FBA business because that fuels prime in 1-day delivery and 2-day delivery and same-day delivery. So, that\u2019s very important. But we see the FC piece likely moderating this year. And then the third piece is transportation. We still see additional levels of investment in that in 2022. So, if you wrap that up, we expect CapEx including equipment finance leases to increase year-over-year. I can\u2019t give you the exact percentage, but hopefully, it gives you a little more dynamic on what -- how we approach it. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney : You lay out all of these costs that you were expecting to see in the December quarter. Just talk to whether there are any real surprises to you. So, it looks like you had a little bit greater leverage than you may have thought. And then use that to help us think about what the -- I think you said the sun is coming out. Financially, does that mean that we\u2019re going to have a kind of nice improvement in operating margins as we go through the year as some of those temporary costs get temporized and you get to absorb some of the more fixed costs? So, just talk about where the surprise was in terms of those costs that you laid out for the December quarter, the $6 billion? And how should we think about those playing out as we go forward? Brian Olsavsky : Okay, Mark. Just remember that I\u2019m sitting in Seattle. So, my view of the sun coming out is a little different than perhaps where you are. But we do see things improving. We do -- let\u2019s step back to Q4. We had said that we would have about $4 billion of additional costs due to labor shortages and the inefficiencies of that cause as well as increased labor rates and shift differentials of premiums and external transportation costs. We came in just slightly over that $4 billion. I think things went as expected. I would say that the hiring was strong, but we could have done better. We could have had more people, so we had to cover a lot of -- there was additional overtime. There are some higher costs on third-party transportation. But, all-in-all, the challenge in Q4 was to staff, raise -- or excuse me, increase the staffing, and we said we wanted to add 150,000 people or more. We added net-net of about 140,000 in the quarter, 273,000 in the second half of the year. So, as you turn the page into 2022, we feel good -- better about labor, except Omicron has kicked up, and now you have a different type of labor issue where there\u2019s a lot of people who are on leave of absences and short term as they work to have a positive test on COVID and can get back into the workforce and protect their fellow workers. So, there\u2019s instances where you\u2019re paying twice or 3 times for the same labor hour if someone is on leave, you\u2019re paying them and you\u2019re also paying potentially for someone who\u2019s covering the shift on over time. So, there\u2019s cost pressure in Q1. I think, the good news is that the labor challenge is not as great in Q1 as it is in Q4 -- Q3 and Q4. So, we\u2019re hopeful on that. We have to work to now make our operations more efficient as we get staffing levels up. And we\u2019re going to plow a lot of our effort into increasing our transportation speeds and beating our pre-pandemic levels. So, there\u2019s a lot of different challenges going on right now. The team has been working heads down for over two years now. So, they need -- we\u2019ve got a great team, and we have confidence that we will -- things will improve as we get through the year. So hopefully, that answers your question. Operator : Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Colin Sebastian : I wanted to ask about AWS, and nice acceleration in revenues there. Wondering if you could talk about maybe more specifically the driver of that acceleration. Is the application layer maybe now large enough where you\u2019re seeing that contribute incrementally to growth? And I think in the release, you also highlighted infrastructure expansion globally. I think it might be interesting to add some context around the scale or distribution of the AWS business internationally outside of North America, if you could put some context around that. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Colin. Thanks for your questions. On the growth rate, I think it\u2019s a combination of things. We\u2019ve been adding resources in sales and marketing over the last few years, and that is starting to pay off. There was some cutback in spending in the early parts of 2020 that we\u2019re lapping as people -- different companies have different COVID experience, some their volumes went through the roof, some their volumes went through the floor. So as things have stabilized, I think the lasting thing is that a lot of people made the commitment to go to the cloud, better understood the benefits of that and probably accelerated their internal time lines for that. And we\u2019re there to help, and we\u2019re working very hard to make that journey a successful one and we have a strong team of sales and marketing professionals to help as well as technical advisors. So that is what we\u2019re seeing, and we\u2019re pleased with the acceleration in the business the last four quarters. We will see -- we\u2019re also pleased with the efficiency of the infrastructure investment, as I mentioned, the expansion of useful life is not done on an accounting basis unless you have proof that it\u2019s actually -- we\u2019re seeing it in real life. So, very positive indicators in AWS. Dave Fildes : Colin, it\u2019s Dave here. Just following up on the international point, what we\u2019re seeing outside of the U.S., I mean we are -- as part of that overall strong growth, we are continuing to see considerable momentum really around the world. It\u2019s customers moving their workloads over to AWS at different phases. And so, as you look at the release, some of the other announcements, there\u2019s a good diverse list of companies, Adidas in Germany migrated its SAP environments to AWS, in the Netherlands, Stellantis selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider. There\u2019s a number of really great companies examples doing different big things at different stages of that migration. What\u2019s been important to us, amongst many things is continuing to expand our global infrastructure footprint really to support this momentum we\u2019re seeing. So, just this last quarter in the fourth quarter, we opened the Asia Pacific region over in Jakarta. And we\u2019ve got announcements for plans to launch and Canada in the Calgary region next year or perhaps it 2023 or 2024. So, a lot of work and a lot of momentum. Those are just a few examples. But where we sit now, it\u2019s -- AWS has 84 availability zones in 26 regions around the world right now. And just in terms of the forward-looking road map, we have announced to launch 24 more zones in 8 more regions, and those will be here in the next couple of years. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. So, I just want to dig a little bit into third-party seller services. The growth slowed there even on a two-year stack. So maybe if you could talk about some of the factors that you think could be weighing on that? And then, just on AWS, you kind of laid out some color there. Is there any bottlenecks to growth that you\u2019re still seeing? I mean, you talked about why this is a very good quarter and having to do with some of the comps, but any bottlenecks to grow, either supply chain or employee related? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sorry. Jason, is your second question on AWS? Jason Helfstein : Yes, on AWS. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, sorry. Let me start with that. No, we don\u2019t see bottlenecks on the capacity side or -- probably the limiter in that business is our ability to work with customers to accelerate their time lines. So, we\u2019re investing and working hard to do that. So -- but operationally, we continue to add capacity, as I mentioned, on the capital section -- capital discussion, and we expect that to increase year-over-year in 2022. On 3P, I think what you\u2019re seeing is a decreasing growth rate, much like the rest of the business, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re dealing with the very high growth period from Q3 of 2020 through Q1 of 2021. But on a two-year basis, you\u2019re still seeing 31% compounded annual growth in the 3P seller services revenue. Granted that was in the -- it was 34% last quarter, but it\u2019s maintaining. I think the bigger point is that sellers are definitely big winners in Q4. The percentage of units up to 56% was a record for 3P. We continue to invest a lot to make sellers -- help sellers be successful on our site. They\u2019re a big consumer of advertising as well because they use it to build their brands and add -- enable customers to see their selection and make purchases. So we\u2019re very happy with the third-party seller services businesses, and again, looking for ways to help sellers be successful. Operator : Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Great. Maybe I\u2019ll talk about advertising services. What -- maybe tell us why you decided to break it out, if you haven\u2019t already? And then, how much Prime Day might have been a factor in the deceleration? But bigger picture, how much room does that line have to grow bigger than GMV growth? How do we think about where you are on penetration on that? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Let me start with why we broke it out. We\u2019ve looked at the proportion of other revenue that is advertising services. And we got to a point where -- and I had been pretty much mentioning every quarter that for the majority of that line item was advertising revenue. And we feel it at a certain size that we should break it out and split the other half of that. So, that was really the impetus for the change. And we look at those things every year, and end of year was a good time to do it as we start 2022. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful for you to understand the growth rate without having to impute it from the other revenue. The growth rate in the quarter of 33% was down from 66% in Q4 of last year. Q4 last year obviously had Prime Day in it for first time. And Prime Day carries a lot. I can\u2019t scale it for you, but there\u2019s a lot of advertising tied to Prime Day, obviously. So when that moves quarters, it generally has an impact on the run rates. We saw that a bit in Q2 of this year when we did have Prime Day and it was lapping -- Q2 2021 was lapping, the 2020 period that didn\u2019t have a Prime Day in it. So, that will move around a bit. But I think the bigger story here is the success we\u2019re having with sellers and vendors, and making that a useful product for customers. Dave Fildes : And Justin, just to add to that, I mean the priorities with advertising are -- at a high level, it\u2019s improved the tool usability. We think there\u2019s great feedback loops with customers, as Brian mentioned, to keep building and making that better. That results in building more relevancy and better engaging experiences. And again, the more we can interact with the advertisers, the customers and learn and have more opportunities to hear from them and understand that we can build better analytic tools, provide better measurement, give them better insight in performance. So, really focused on serving brands. And it\u2019s in the sponsored ad space, but we\u2019ve talked about video advertising is certainly a great opportunity. And as we\u2019ve got properties like Fire TV, IMDb TV, Twitch, live sports, a lot of exciting things that have been going on in the live sports and certainly to come this year as well, both in the NFL here in the U.S., but overseas in a number of properties, really excited to kind of work with folks. And again, this is about delivering good recommendations to customers and helpful when they\u2019re making their purchase decisions and giving them information around that. And that, in turn, of course, helps the advertisers as well and have a great result. So, I think that\u2019s one area that we\u2019re excited about. Longer term, demand-side platform opportunities with Amazon DSP is something that we\u2019re continuing to work on and refine and again, focus on the customer as we always do. Operator : Our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen. John Blackledge : Two questions. First, could you discuss how supply -- the supply chain affected the business in 4Q, and how we should think about perhaps impacts from supply chain issues in 1Q \u201822 and for the year? And then, the second question would be, do you expect to increase Prime pricing in non-U.S. markets? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Hi, John. Thank you for your question. First on the Prime question. We evaluate each country differently. We look at the relative price to the customer versus our cost to supply that and the usage and the value that we\u2019re creating for customers. We felt, especially after not raising the price in the United States since 2018 that the time was right to raise it. And we think it\u2019s a much more valuable program today than it was in 2020, let alone 2018. So, other countries, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate every year and nothing else to announce right now. On supply chain, there\u2019s specific things that I think we all see in the supply chain where we\u2019re waiting for products. But as far as Amazon is concerned, we did a lot to combat the supply chain issues we saw in Q4 or anticipated in Q4. We bottled product ahead. We work with vendors to secure inventory early, in some cases, paid earlier, which had a working capital impact. We also worked very hard to open up channels of -- existing channels of input into the country, whether it was port capacity or vessel capacity. So, we did everything. We knew how to as far as trying to get more capacity in a constrained market. And we think it worked for our customers in Q4 as challenges remain in \u201820, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve totally passed that, but we don\u2019t expect it to be a big issue in Q1. Operator : Our final question is from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Dan Salmon : First, I just wanted to follow up a little bit and see on the advertising numbers, if there\u2019s any qualitative color that you could add, say, rough balance of performance advertising versus brand advertising, maybe U.S. versus rest of the world. Anything you add could be great. And then, just second, Brian, you mentioned the exclusive broadcast of Thursday Night Football and is one of the reasons supporting a higher price increase for Prime. Dave, you mentioned it as an element that is a dynamic new one for the advertising business. Maybe could we just return to that point as the sort of importance of live sports in the video space is incredibly important, is that one that you see kind of taking the business to a new level at this stage? Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with that second question. So, I didn\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that we raised prices because there\u2019s any football. I just use that as an example of great new content that we\u2019ve been investing in for Prime members to make the Prime membership more valuable as well as international sports, we had one of the highest rated games in the Q4 with, I believe, is Manchester United and -- I\u2019m going to mix up the team, sorry. Dave Fildes : Arsenal, I don\u2019t know. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, I won\u2019t embarrass myself. But, the -- so again, we\u2019ve been working on getting sports properties that will be beneficial and valuable to prime offering. We\u2019re still probably early on in that. We\u2019ve had obviously success with Premier League Soccer, other soccer leagues around the world, Tennis properties and also probably the marquee as the work with the NFL on Thursday Night Football. Dave Fildes : Dan, in terms of just break out, I think as we\u2019ve said before, on the advertising side, the sponsored products and brands, they make up the majority of the ad revenue today. We haven\u2019t given a split on a geographic basis. But suffice to say, a lot of these efforts, Brian talked about, whether it\u2019s on the video, advertising opportunities for -- in those sponsored products and sponsored brand efforts, we\u2019ve replicated a lot of the tools and features and services around the world and are kind of constantly learning and building out the brand and the presence with that so we can make better inroads with customers over the long term. Brian Olsavsky : And because I don\u2019t want to leave you hanging, Dan, the Manchester United and Arsenal soccer game in December was the most watched Premier League match ever on our service with an estimated viewership of 4 million. So, I think that is actually pretty interesting because we\u2019ve had a lot of increasingly good relationship with the Premier League. We\u2019ve had Boxing Day games, and we continue to be a valuable partner for each other. Dave Fildes : With that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.",

This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining today's call. I'd like to start with a few comments on what we're seeing as we're coming out of the pandemic, both on the customer experience side and on the operating cost side in this current inflationary environment. Let's start with demand and customer experience. Worldwide net sales in Q1 were $116.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the top end of our guidance range of $112 billion to $117 billion. Our compound annual growth since before the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing before the pandemic. Our prime members continue to be a key driver of growth. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic, and we continue to see consistently high member renewal rates. We also added millions more new Prime members during the quarter. Throughout the past two years, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. In the first quarter, we made encouraging progress on key customer metrics. Delivery speed performance is now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020. And we now have the widest selection ever available for Prime's fast delivery. We have worked to protect and enhance the customer experience despite a sharp increase in costs, particularly over the past three quarters. We've seen a large cost to keep up with demand these past two years. During this period, we doubled the size of our operations and nearly doubled our workforce to 1.6 million employees. Labor and physical space are no longer the bottlenecks they were throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our consumer business. We'll break these into two buckets, externally driven costs, primarily inflation; and internally controllable costs, primarily productivity and fixed cost deleverage. The externally driven costs are a result of intensifying inflationary pressures throughout Q1. Line haul air and ocean shipping rates continue to be at or above the rates in the second half of last year, which were already much higher than pre-COVID levels. Some of this is due to the impact of the Omicron variant in China and labor shortages at point of origin, and the start of the war in the Ukraine has contributed to high fuel prices. For example, the cost to ship in overseas containers more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates. And the cost of fuel is approximately 1.5 times higher than it was even a year ago. Combined with the year-over-year increases in wage inflation, these inflationary pressures have added approximately $2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year. While we will continue to look for ways to mitigate these costs, we expect they will be around for some time. The next bucket of costs related to productivity and fixed cost leverage, which we consider to be more within our control and are working to reduce. These additional costs correspond to the state of the labor force and fulfillment network following two years of disruption and large demand variability. We now look forward to more predictability in our consumer order patterns and greater stability in our operations. Let's start with labor. As a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we were operating in a labor-constrained environment. With the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, we saw a substantial increase in fulfillment network employees that on leave, and we continue to hire new employees to cover these absences. As the variant subsided in the second half of the quarter and employees returned from leave, we quickly transitioned from being understaffed to being overstaffed, resulting in lower productivity. This lower productivity added approximately $2 billion in costs compared to last year. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into April, we've seen productivity improvements across the network, and we expect to reduce these cost headwinds in Q2. The last issue relates to our fixed cost leverage. Despite still seeing strong customer demand and expansion of our FBA business, we currently have excess capacity in our fulfillment and transportation network. Capacity decisions are made years in advance, and we made conscious decisions in 2020 and early 2021 to not let space be a constraint on our business. During the pandemic, we were facing not only unprecedented demand, but also extended lead times on new capacity. And we built towards the high end of a very volatile demand outlook. Now that demand patterns have stabilized, we see an opportunity to better match our capacity to demand. We have lowered our operations, capital expenditures for 2022 and are evaluating other ways to increase our fixed cost leverage. We estimate that this overcapacity, coupled with the extraordinary leverage we saw in Q1 of last year, resulted in $2 billion of additional costs year-over-year in Q1. We do expect the effects of these fixed cost leverage to persist for the next several quarters as we grow into this capacity. When you combine the impacts of the externally driven costs and the internally controllable costs, you get approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter. Approximately two-thirds of these costs are within our control. And with demand normalizing, we remain focused on rightsizing our cost structure and driving out any cost inefficiencies. Our guidance includes an expectation that we will incur approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in the AWS segment, where net sales were $18.4 billion in Q1, up 37% year-over-year and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $74 billion. Developers at organizations of all sizes from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Telefonica, Verizon, Boeing, MongoDB, Amdocs, Bundesliga, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the NHL and Thread announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. We also continue to build support infrastructure to best serve AWS' millions of customers. We recently completed the launch of our first 16 local zones in the United States with 32 more to come across 26 countries. Local zones extend AWS regions to place our services at the edge of the cloud near large population, industry and IT centers, expanding our infrastructure footprint and enabling customers to build with single-digit millisecond latency performance. Last quarter, I provided some detail on our overall capital investments. So, let me add to that with our current thinking. First, as a reminder, we look at the combination of CapEx plus finance leases. Capital investments were $61 billion on the trailing 12-month period ended March 31. About 40% of that went to infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS, but also supporting our sizable consumer business. About 30% is fulfillment capacity, primarily fulfillment center warehouses. A little less than 25% is for transportation. So, think of that as the middle and last-mile capacity related to customer shipments. The remaining 5% or so is comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. For full year 2022, we do expect infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, in large part, to support the rapid growth in innovation we're seeing within AWS. We expect infrastructure should represent about half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the consumer business, as I said earlier, we currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into. So, we've brought down our build expectations. Note again that many of the build decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago, so there are limitations on what we can adjust midyear. That said, we expect fulfillment dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. We also expect transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be flat to slightly down. Finally, I'll highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $7.6 billion, included in nonoperating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. You may remember that we had a $12 billion gain on Rivian in Q4. We also provided our second quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. As a reminder, our comparable period of Q2 2021 included the continuation of extraordinary net sales growth in roughly the first half of that quarter. That began to moderate in the second half as vaccines became more readily available in many countries and people started getting out of their homes. In addition, note that this year's Prime Day sales event will occur in the third quarter, in July to be specific. Last year, in 2021, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter. Prime Day contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. Lastly, as you look at our Q2 operating income guidance, a reminder that we will see our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense as our employees receive annual restricted stock unit grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6 billion, up from $3.3 billion in Q1, largely reflecting wage inflation as we continue to hire and retain employees in high-demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks. I want to ask two questions, please. In terms of the revenue guide for the June quarter, I think it sort of implies about 3%. And if you look sequentially and if you look back at the last couple of years, the non-COVID years, the growth has been between 4% and 6%. Are you seeing signs of consumer softness or weakening? Is there any particular factor that would be -- cause your sequential growth to be lower than typical? And then briefly on the margins for Q2. So, you got $4 billion in kind of these incremental costs versus $6 billion in the March quarter, but yet your guidance year-over-year implies kind of the same sort of year-over-year margin decline, about 500 bps. Could you just explain that a little bit? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Hi Mark. How are you doing? On revenue, yes, the revenue guidance we've given is kind of our best view of what we're seeing right now. Customer demand does remain strong. We're seeing, again, continued strength in Prime purchases, Prime commitment, levels of usage, benefits being used, et cetera. And the big part of the year-over-year comp is that we're comping the last part of the very elevated year-over-year step-up that lasted about half of last year's second quarter, and then we move Prime Day to Q3. So, we're not seeing softness. We're cognizant of the current inflationary environment and the impact it has on consumer -- or excuse me, the household budgets, a lot of times that is a time when -- and people come to Amazon because they know we have great prices and selection and convenience. So, it can go one of two ways. But we don't see any macroeconomic factors generally in this forecast on the demand side. We definitely see it on the cost side. Dave Fildes : And Mark, I think your second question was related to the operating income guidance and some of the detail there. So, as Brian said, the first time we've given the guidance for the second quarter. But you detailed a number of pieces, but like you said, expect to see, in aggregate, about $4 billion of pressure for the 3 buckets that Brian talked about, higher inflationary pressures, lower productivity and some fixed cost deleverage persisting into Q2. So, that will be at some lower levels as we aim to and kind of expect to see some improvement in productivity, some of those other areas. We're also committed to just generally reducing variable cost per unit and working to lever our fixed costs, specifically where we have those controllable cost buckets Brian spoke about. The other thing -- again, Brian mentioned it towards the end there of this opening -- to see that seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense. So, recall that our employees received those RSU grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see the expense of approximately $6 billion. And so, that's up from about $3.3 billion in the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Big picture, Amazon hasn't really been around during a period of high inflation. How do you think about passing through the higher input costs through pricing? When you look at your units, they're flat and you're just not seeing any price increases in there. I know FX is a headwind, but how do you think about passing that through? And when can we start to see that? And then, second question, it looks like your shipping costs are up 14% versus units flat, probably makes sense with the input costs. But we would expect some savings as you bring a lot of that transportation in-house, a lot of the delivery in-house. Is -- are you seeing savings there? And how do you think about shipping costs versus units? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me make a comment on units first. If we step back, the first year of the pandemic from -- essentially from our world from the middle of May 2020 to May 2021, we saw high growth. We went from a 20% growth rate in revenue to a 40% growth rate almost overnight and held it for a year. And then, we started to lap that for the last year that will essentially end in the middle of this next month. And so, I noted step-downs in the run rate as soon as the middle of May hit last year. So, on units though, units grew during that -- instead of jumping from -- to 40%, they jumped to the mid-40% to 50% range, mainly because of the product mix, people were buying a lot more gloves and cleaning agents and all the things tied to the pandemic. So, there's a lot of -- you have to look at the unit data with keeping that in mind because there's a mix -- heavy mix issue. But putting all that aside, you asked the question about transportation shipping rates. Our shipping rates are very competitive, and we are seeing savings versus what we would get from external carriers. And it's beyond that. We would not even necessarily have had the capacity to -- from external third-party providers to handle the transportation loads that we've seen in the last couple of years. So, we're really glad that we have our -- as we built our AMZL network, we would not be able to have a one-day program, same day and one-day shipments, if we try to deliver it with third-party shippers. It just would not be cost effective. So, what you're seeing there in the growth in shipping costs versus the unit growth, a little bit on the unit side, but essentially a factor of inflation and productivity that I've mentioned to you on the component that hits in the transportation area. Dave Fildes : Justin, on your second point regarding inflation, of course, we've talked about we're not immune to inflationary pressures on the cost side and with the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the start of the war in the Ukraine since our last quarter. We see larger impacts of inflation, some line haul, shipping rates, fuel shipping supplies and wages, which we talked about in some recent quarters as well. And we also see some volatility in utility pricing for some of the energy costs in operating the AWS data centers. Now, when you look at costs for customers and sellers in terms of product pricing, I just reinforce our pricing philosophy hasn't changed. We aim to offer low competitive pricing and try to stay on top of that pricing environment and make sure we're delivering a great price for customers. For our 1P business, that means continuing to be really competitive in that space with low prices relative to the reputable competitors out there and staying really close to that on the data. For third-party, we don't control that price that's set by third-party sellers. So, they're running their own businesses and we'll adjust the pricing to account for inflationary costs in their environment as well. And of course, on pricing and another other many other services with sellers, we offer services to help them not only handle with logistics, but also get better pricing information to make sure that they're staying on top of that as well. So, wherever we can help them, we do that. We did increase some fees effective, I believe, is today related to the FBA sellers and some surcharge there. We're focused on, of course, addressing permanent costs and ensuring our fees are competitive versus those charged out there by their sellers. But it's still unclear if the inflationary costs will go up or down and so -- and for how long they'll persist. So, rather than a permanent fee change, we implemented that fuel and inflation surcharge for the first time. And it's, of course, a mechanism that's broadly used across the supply chain providers that are out there already, but it's the first time that we've done something like this. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Thomas : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, Brian, I want to ask you about one day, same day. Now that you're getting inventory selection, SKU selection in some cases back to where it was pre-pandemic. What are you seeing from a demand or an elasticity perspective as you get more inventory available for one day, same day? Is it really leading to incremental sales based on your data? And the second one, I want to ask about tech and content. It came in a little higher despite AWS costs coming in lower. Is there anything else we should sort of be thinking about in our modeling in tech and content, whether it's Kuiper or other items that are moving through that line item for the year? Brian Olsavsky : Let me start with your first question on one day and same day. Yes, we're approaching the service levels that we had pre-pandemic, and that's a positive sign. But this doesn't -- it doesn't turn on a dime, I think as a consumer, I noticed it myself, I see more things in stock. And I -- it opens up the consideration set for things that I may have had to run to a store to get in a short period of time. And that trust and -- as you see more and more of that, you trust it and you continue to order and you then go to Amazon first and say, okay, well, it's maybe my first stop before I even think about going to the store. So, it's a -- it has to be built over time. It doesn't take years. It takes hopefully, weeks and months. But we're hopeful and expecting that that will add to good elasticity, the same elasticity is that we start to see prepandemic? Dave Fildes : On the second point, the technology and content. Just as a reminder, components in there is you got the Amazon Tech and the AWS infrastructure, so everything from servers, network and equipment, data center-related depreciation, rent utilities, those types of things. The AWS Tech employee costs and costs to support the dotcom website and a number of other technology initiatives that we're working on. For Q1, it was up about 19% year-over-year, which was down a little bit, less than what you see for year-over-year growth throughout 2021. That growth rate, though, does, of course, include an offset Q1 2022 related to a partial offset, I should say, related to the change in estimated useful lives for servers, which was a little under $1 billion of impact in the first quarter. In terms of just the investment areas, I just reinforced it, it\u2019s continued investment in the tech infrastructure. One of the bigger pieces remains AWS, of course, there. And then, just broadly speaking, inclusive of AWS, the headcount to support -- the build-out and support that the AWS team is doing as well as some consumer tech teams, Alexa and Echo devices and certain other areas there. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for the question. You talked about how you're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity and, in fact, you're actually running at in excess at the moment. So, hoping you could talk a little bit about how long you think it could take to regain some of the productivity and cost efficiencies in the fulfillment network. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure thing. Well, let me start with productivity. We began and ended the quarter with essentially 1 billion -- excuse me, 1.6 million employees, 1.6 million employees, mostly -- most of them, of course, are in operations. During the quarter, we had a peak of 1.7 million, and we were able to work that down by the end of the quarter. So, we have certain ability with contractors and all to adjust headcount. But for the most part, our employees are what we call blue badges or permanent Amazon employees. And now, we work on getting productivity up. It's a combination of productivity at the employee level, but it's also a matter of productivity of the -- and harmonization of the network, having the right demand in the right -- excuse me, the right capacity and the right demand matched at the warehouse level and the transportation node level. So, that's what we're working on. And we've made good strides in the last month, and we're -- we see a line of sight to getting back, not all the way to prepandemic rates in the next quarter or two, but a good bit of the way. And that's what we're firmly focused on and working on, and that's in the warehouses and also in transportation. Is there a second half to that question? Okay. Go ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. And I hope you're both well. Maybe if I could, just sticking on the capacity issues for a minute. In terms of the $4 billion number you're calling out, maybe the first part of the question would be, is that entirely the additional issues that are now front and center versus the issues we talked about from Q4 into first half of '22 from a logistics and supply chain standpoint where we had talked about permanent versus transient cost nature of that $4 billion as you move through the first half of the year? So, is this above and beyond that and above and beyond some of the lingering COVID costs that you had called out in prior periods? Just wanted to unpack some of the stack build of the $4 billion versus thing we already knew before. And then, maybe following up on Doug's question and asking it a little bit differently. When you look out to the back part of the year, not asking for how you might guide. But there's a typical cadence to fulfillment expense build and employee build and headcount build into the back part of the year as you build the capacity towards the holidays. Will that have a very different cadence to it this year because you find yourself with this much excess capacity at Q1, Q2 versus prior years, just so we can keep that front of mind? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure thing. Good questions, Eric. Let me start with the cost penalties. So, in Q4, we did mention $4 billion of cost penalties and drag on that quarter. And $1 billion of that was fixed cost deleverage, principally a combination of having enough space and having super high leverage in the prior year when we were chasing volume and had less space. And we indicated that that would be carrying over into 2022 and it has. From a productivity standpoint, our issues in the second half of last year were different. They were -- we didn't have as much labor, even though we added, I believe, was 200 -- I have it right here, 270,000 workers in the second half of last year. We were chasing labor and it was creating much disruption within our network. Long zone shipments, half full trucks, all kinds of negative consequences of not having labor, but we made it through Q4 with the anticipation that we'll be able to hold our labor for Q1 and labor certainty would be a lot better and certain in our network. That is still the plan, and we're probably a couple of months late on that because of some of the issues with Omicron in January. And our reaction to it was that uncertain labor environment where a lot of people were on leave. We hired more people and then found ourselves overstaffed when the Omicron variant subsided rather quickly, at least from our standpoint in warehouses. So, the issue is switched from disruption to productivity losses to overcapacity on labor. And we believe that that will dissipate. It will take time in Q2, but -- so it's not the full -- we don't get the full $2 billion back in Q2, but we will make great strides on that. Inflation has been in both periods. Inflation was in the transportation costs, especially in wage inflation last year. It remains there. It's been amplified a bit by the fuel costs following the Ukraine conflict, which has happened since we last spoke. So, it's more a factor -- those costs will now, we believe, will persist a little longer than we were hoping at the beginning of the year. And I mentioned some of the per unit rates for transportation, cargo shipments and also fuel costs. Those are real, and we have to find ways to offset those or use less of high-cost things, like transportation and fuel. So, we're working on that. As we progress, there's only guidance for Q2. But what we see is that the fixed cost deleverage will narrow as we go through the year, and we'll be really glad we have this capacity in Q3 when Prime Day hits because that's always a big surge of both, inventory and orders, and then definitely in the holiday season. So, we will -- the way we see it as we've come out of a very tumultuous two years. We are glad we made the decisions we made over the past two years. And now we have a chance to more rightsize our capacity to a more normalized demand pattern. So, what's left there is really inflation, and that's what we're working on and evaluating and finding ways to mitigate and in some cases, having to pass some of the costs through to third-party sellers as well so that we're not subsidizing sales there. And then, we will see. So, we expect the year-over-year revenue comps to improve in the second half of the year because, again, we're passing this year of super high growth that I mentioned before from May of 2020 to May of 2021. But, it's not like the volume has receded. Like, in Q1 literally, where revenue 61% higher over two years from 2020. So the way to think about it is it went up and stayed up and now it's -- it will resume a more normal growth pattern. But I wouldn't be full by the revenue growth rates in this difficult comp period. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : So, the letter mentioned some impacts post the Ukraine invasion. I'm guessing it's mostly on the inflation and the fuel costs just mentioned. But any comment about how revenue trajectory compared in March after the conflict started versus before across your geographies? And is there any noticeable difference between Prime member volume and non-Prime? Thanks a lot. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Hi Ross. No, I would say there's not a lot of Prime versus non-Prime differential. We had what we consider to be a very strong March. It's very hard to compare year-over-year because March last year was the height of some stimulus payments in the United States. But from kind of a sequential period, we thought March was strong. So, there's no indicators that we're seeing of weakness in consumer demand, but we're wary of it as probably all companies are because household budgets are tightened when fuel costs are doubling and a big part of your -- it ripples through food, it ripples through everything else. So, we're cognizant of that. But what we'll focus on is the customer experience, continue to get our delivery times to be better and increasing selection, which is better than pre-pandemic time period and you're making the customer experience great on a lot of dimensions. Operator : Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Two questions. Just can you talk about advertising a bit? Are you seeing supply chain disruption having any impact on advertising? Just any comments there? And then, second, I don't think AWS backlog was asked. If there's any numbers you can share on AWs backlog growth this quarter versus last quarter. Thanks. Dave Fildes : Yes. Jason, I'll take the second one first, just on the backlog. So, yes, I mean, we're continuing to see what the backlog is, right? It's the increase of AWS customers making long-term commitments for AWS. At the March period ended, we had $88.9 billion balance for that. So, that's up about 68% year-over-year. And the weighted average remaining kind of life term for those is 3.8 years. Brian Olsavsky : And on revenue -- excuse me, advertising revenue was up 25% year-over-year, and that's a strong run rate compared to the revenue growth rate. So, we're still very happy and pleased with the way the advertising team is performing and how advertising has been valued by both, sellers and vendors and others who use it to reach our customer base at the point where they're considering purchases. So, a strong quarter and continue to roll out new and new products for sellers to manage their advertising and increase the ability to analyze and calculate the payback on marketing investments with us. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks for joining today's call. Before we get the questions, I'll make some comments about our Q2 performance and the outlook for Q3. Let's start with Q2. During the quarter, we saw improvement in many of our key operational metrics, including in-stock levels and delivery speed and saw a subsequent step-up in consumer demand. For the quarter, worldwide net sales of $121.2 billion exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range and represented an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding approximately 320 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was a larger foreign exchange headwind than the 200 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q2 guidance. As a reminder, our revenue growth accelerated to over 40% growth from the period between May 2020 and May 2021. While demand has remained strong, the lapping of this high growth period, depressed our revenue growth rate for the following 12 months ending in May of this year. Our growth rates going forward will no longer require this historical explanation. Q2 of last year was also when vaccines had become more available, particularly in the United States and we began to see more normal shopping patterns. Prime Day also occurred in Q2 last year and contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. This year's Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12th and 13th, and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. As the impacts of the last two years are normalizing, we are happy with how we've served customers and how they have responded. Our compound annual growth, since the start of the pandemic, stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we are seeing prior to the pandemic. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic. Over that period, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. We continue to improve the customer experience in Q2, including quarter-over-quarter improvements in delivery speed and inventory in stock levels. We have also moved quickly to adjust our staffing levels and improve the efficiency of our significantly expanded operations network. We have slowed our 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans to better align with expected customer demand. While there's still work to be done, we've made good progress in Q2. Our Prime membership program remains a key driver of our worldwide stores business, and we continue innovating to make the membership even more useful and valuable. That includes the upcoming premier of The Lord of the Rings : The Rings of Power on September 2 and exclusive access to NFL Thursday Night Football games starting September 15. Our seller community also had a strong Q2. Third-party sellers represented 57% of all units sold on Amazon in Q2, the highest percentage ever. Selling partners helped to expand the selection we can offer customers while fulfillment by Amazon provides sellers the ability to offer fast delivery. Operating income was $3.3 billion in the quarter, above the top end of our guidance range. Last quarter, I discussed several cost pressures facing our worldwide stores business; inflationary costs, fulfillment network productivity, and fixed cost deleverage. Recall that these amounted to approximately $6 billion of incremental costs in Q1 when compared to Q1 2021. We've made solid progress in reducing these costs. For the second quarter, incremental costs were in line with our expectations at approximately $4 billion when compared to Q2 2021. Inflationary pressures remained at elevated levels in Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1. These include pressures from higher fuel, trucking, air and ocean shipping rates, which we expect will continue into Q3. We made strides to improve fulfillment network productivity in Q2. Staffing levels were more in line with rising Q2 demand, and we saw better optimization of our fulfillment network. On the transportation side, we've continued to improve delivery route density and improve package deliveries per hour. We are encouraged by the progress during the quarter and see opportunity to further improve in the second half of the year. Lastly, the year-over-year negative impact of fixed cost leverage was relatively consistent with Q1. There are two main drivers when talking about fixed cost leverage. First is the unfavorable comparison to very high holiday level utilization rates that we saw in the first half of 2021. And second is the normal step down in volumes off of our Q4 peak that we saw in first half of 2022. On the first point, we expect this challenging year-over-year comp will have ended in Q2. On the second point, we expect fixed cost leverage to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to grow into our capacity. We've also taken steps to slow future network capacity additions. Let's turn to AWS. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in AWS, where net sales were $19.7 billion in Q2, up 33% year-over-year, and now represented an annualized sales run rate of nearly $79 billion. AWS continues to grow at a fast pace, and we believe we are still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector adoption of the cloud. We see great opportunity to continue to make investments on behalf of AWS customers. We continue to invest thoughtfully in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, while expanding AWS to new regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Developers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Delta Air Lines, Riot Games, British Telecom, and Jefferies' Investment Bank to name a few announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. AWS operating income was $5.7 billion in Q2. As a reminder, this includes a portion of our seasonal Q2 step-up in stock-based compensation expense. AWS results include a greater mix of these costs, reflecting wage inflation in high demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers as well as increasing technology infrastructure investment to support long-term growth. Now let's talk about capital investments. As usual, we will discuss the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2021, we incurred approximately $60 billion in capital investments. About 40% of that is comprised of technology infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS as well as our worldwide stores business. Another 30% of the $60 billion was fulfillment capacity and a little less than 25% was for transportation, remaining 5% was comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. For full-year 2022, we do expect to spend slightly more on capital investments than last year, but the proportion of capital spending shifts among our businesses. We expect technology infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, primarily to support the rapid growth in innovation we are seeing with AWS. We expect infrastructure to represent a bit more than half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the worldwide stores business, we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with customer demand. We expect the fulfillment and transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. Finally, I'd highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $2 billion in the second quarter, while we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $3.9 billion, which is included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. In the U.S., we've started making customer deliveries using the Rivian electric delivery vehicles. This rollout is the start of what we expect to be thousands of EDVs in more than 100 cities by the end of the year and 100,000 vehicles across the U.S. by the year 2030. Additionally, note that all of our share and per share information included in our financial materials has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split, which was effective on May 27th. We also provided our third quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. Again, a reminder that this year, our Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12th and 13th, and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. Prime Day occurred in Q2 in 2021. For revenue, note that our guidance includes an estimated approximately 390 basis points of unfavorable impact from year-over-year change in foreign exchange rates. The estimated FX impact to operating income is not significant. Our third quarter operating income guidance range is zero to $3.5 billion. This compares to Q2 operating income of $3.3 billion. This third quarter guidance assumes, we see approximately $1.5 billion in quarter-over-quarter sequential cost improvement in our fulfillment network operations, which we expect will be largely offset by investments in AWS and additional digital content for Prime members. For AWS, this quarter-over-quarter increases are primarily driven by higher infrastructure investments to support continued strong customer growth, including larger depreciation on a growing fixed asset base. We also expect increased energy costs as we continue to see volatility in utility prices around the world and operating our AWS data centers. Quarter-over-quarter increase in digital content primarily relates to new Prime Video content in Q3, including Thursday Night Football and The Lord of the Rings : The Rings of Power. Thank you. And now let's move on to your questions. Operator : At this time, we'll now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Brian, I wanted to just talk a little bit about the bridge from 2Q to 3Q EBIT guide a little bit. It sounds like you're going to have revenue up nicely. You talked about the efficiencies of the $1.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and some of the incremental investments in content, et cetera. Where are the other areas where you're sort of investing more to grow and is any of that associated with merchandise margin or step-ups in discounting? That would be the first one. And the second one is kind of going back to your comment about you \u2013 how you've slowed 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans. How should we think about the fulfillment and transportation CapEx sort of looking into the fourth quarter into next year? How far ahead of this build have you gone through for the last, call it, nine months? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with your second question. So in any particular year when we're spending capital, a good portion of it, we estimate about 40% this year is being spent in support of warehouses or transportation capacity. That will be opening up and effective in 2023 and beyond. So there's always a pre-spend to keep the \u2013 again, the pipeline moving. So when we make adjustments to the time horizon, the impact is not as great as you might expect in the year 2022. Again, we have moved things out and capital is coming down in those areas as we just mentioned. We'll just have to keep you posted as we go quarter-to-quarter on what our expectations are. On the bridge to Q2 to Q3, so again, you have the \u2013 mentioned three items, ops improvement that we see of a $1.5 billion and offsetting that is increased costs in AWS, as we build out depreciation. We also are adding \u2013 continuing to add people in that space; product engineers, salespeople, customer support. Speaking more broadly, we know AWS is a huge opportunity to early days in the adoption curve for companies and governments. And we invest with that - with that confidence in mind and customers have responded and we're going to keep investing there. Your comment on discounting, we're not seeing some of the pressures that other people are seeing right now. Our macroeconomic issues are principally on inflation and pretty transparent on that. I think the new thing this quarter is additional pressure on the energy, electricity rates in our data centers because of the ramp up in natural gas prices, if you've seen that. So that's probably the new information and then the other inflationary factors. Well, some of them are coming down slightly. They're still significantly a penalty year-over-year. Other cost pressures are principally on our cost of employees. If you look at our stock-based comp as a percent of revenue, it's gone up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter, as we stepped up from Q1 to Q2. We see that pattern every year, but we don't see that magnitude and that's where a lot of our wage inflation is for particularly our technical employees. So there's a certain amount of conservatism always built into this because we are in a very difficult macroeconomic state potentially. Again, we're not seeing it hit our businesses directly. In fact, we're seeing strong growth in sales through the quarter in Q2. But we're cognizant that things could change quickly and we'll see and monitor and that's how we set our forward guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I wanted to ask about AWS. Some of your peers in the cloud space have talked about some slowdown in booking rates just as customers take longer to work through deal terms and duration. So if you could comment on whether AWS is seeing similar dynamics? And then also when you think about margins, the 35% for AWS in 1Q going to 29% in 2Q, what are some of the puts and takes that we should think about going forward just given decreasing server life benefits and tougher macro environment? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Doug. I'll start with second question. So on margins in AWS, yes, as you mentioned that is dropping sequentially. The margin rate is going to fluctuate and this business is going to be always a factor of new investment and things like the sales force and new regions and infrastructure capacity offset by infrastructure efficiency gains that we see. Pricing issues as we extend contracts, we've seen really good progress with our customer base, longer and longer commitments, really committing to the cloud, some of that comes with credits to help them make their conversion to the cloud and so that the revenue pattern can be, and the margin on that revenue can fluctuate quite a bit quarter-to-quarter, but see a lot of strength in the business right now. We're very happy with the growth rate. We're happy with the adoption of the cloud. As you hit a potential rough patch in the economy, I think the last time we saw this was back in 2008-ish. And it\u2019s hard to draw lessons from that, but we did notice that it did help our cloud business at the time because again, when you're trying to launch a new product or service and you have to face with building your own data center and getting capital for a data center and building it yourself or moving to the cloud and essentially buying incremental infrastructure capacity, the cloud computing really shows its value. So we're prepared \u2013 just like when the slowdown in 2020, we are prepared to help customers optimize their costs and will help them any who are scaling down. But we'll also, again, continue to find new customers and new industries including government agencies and happy with that. And if you look again, where our investments been over the last few years and the growth of our sales force and our sales support, it's starting to \u2013 it is showing benefits, and we expect that to continue. On your \u2013 sorry, your other question was, is that\u2026 Douglas Anmuth : Just about current trends in terms of booking rates\u2026 Brian Olsavsky : Got it. I blended into one answer. Douglas Anmuth : Yes, you blended that. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Hopefully that covered what you\u2019re asking about. Douglas Anmuth : Yes, it does. Brian Olsavsky : Doug, just to \u2013 I mean, just to pile on to that too. I mean, I think just the longer term vision I probably talked about here, we're right now with 84 availability zones. So that's 26 geographic regions, and we've got plans for \u2013 to launch 24 more of those availability zones across eight regions. And this is Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, UAE, so a lot of different spots. And so continuing to focus on building out to customers, working on that pipeline and building longer commitments, making \u2013 finding customers that are making longer commitments is really important to that. And just to that point, the backlog figure that we've discussed in the past and disclosed on a quarterly basis on our filings, it's up 65% year-over-year or about 13% quarter-over-quarter and the weighted average remaining life of those long-term commitments that we're talking about here continues to grow. So it's at about 3.9 years on a weighted average remaining life basis. So again, a lot of good work, a lot of still good opportunity out there to come, and as Brian talked about, we're working hard in many facets and investing in that to make sure we're in good position to serve folks. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two-parter on the advertising business, where you saw continued strength. Is there any way to give us an update of how much of the advertising services line at this point is driven by North America e-commerce versus international e-commerce, and how you think about the relative growth rates and advertising going forward between North America and international? And the second part would be away from the e-commerce-driven parts of advertising. How are you feeling about the positioning and the investments you need to make around things like Connected TV and programmatic advertising, where from the outside in it looks like you're continuing to make greater levels of investment and increasing your exposure to a wider array of advertising products? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Great. Hi, Eric. Thanks for your questions. I would say on the geographic split, we haven't broken that out. The majority of advertising revenue is in North America, but having said that, we are making great strides in international as well. And we're also, as you mentioned, expanding our array of advertising products from our consumer websites to video opportunities, Twitch and others. Dave, do you want to take the second part of that? Dave Fildes : Yes. I think it was \u2013 Eric, it was a question around kind of interactive work. I mean, we've got \u2013 one of our main priorities is building relevant and engaging ad experiences. And so, we of course, introduced interactive ads last year for streaming video content, things like Freevee. We've got Amazon Music as ad supported tier as well for audio ads. So looking for opportunities like that, where customers can more easily engage with brands while streaming content. So I think there's a lot of good opportunity for that, but what's great, video advertising, as you mentioned, it's still early in that space, it's increasingly coming mainstream and then viewing behaviors have really shifted away from some of the more traditional cable or kind of traditional viewing and advertisers are using our ad- supported content to reach those viewers. So things that are ongoing we've talked about around Freevee, around Twitch, and then of course, some things we're obviously excited about it. Thursday Night Football and Amazon streaming TV ads capabilities that we're going to continue to work with these partners and work with our own kind of technology capabilities to keep building out. Brian Olsavsky : Eric, I'd just add a little more on advertising because you're probably wondering again about softness \u2013 potential for softness in that or macroeconomic factors. Right now, we still see strong advertising growth. Again, it's got be a positive both for the customer and for the brand. I think our advantage is that we have highly efficient advertising. People are advertising at the point where customers have their credit cards out and are ready to make a purchase. It's also very measurable. And when people are looking, companies are looking to potentially streamline or optimize their advertising spend, we think our products compete very well in that regard. In addition to maybe longer term things like brand building and brings new selection to bear in front of customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. If I can ask two. So you called out just the 3P mix being a kind of highest level, maybe talk about your focus to increase the mix to 3P and how that fits into plans for improved efficiency? And then secondly, on international, how much of the weakness in the margin sequentially was FX-driven? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Let me start on your first one. So challenge the premise is a little bit there about incenting mix, sorry, I believe that is how I interpreted your question. We are relatively indifferent as to whether some customer buys a third-party or first-party product from us. We're all about obviously is price selection and convenience. And 3P particularly helps us with selection. And when it's part of FBA can also help as being more Prime eligible and available to ship in one, two days or whatever the Prime offer happens to be. So we're happy with the selection that we've added from third-party sellers. And I think that shows in the percentage mix that you see. We're proud of the investment we've made to build tools and products that allow sellers to be successful on our site. And it's a great partnership and it's worked really well. Sellers and vendors are also some of our larger advertising customers as well and helps \u2013 that advertising helps them surface new selection to our customer base. So it's a very strong partnership and it's been getting stronger. And I think you'll see also that they had a very big part in our Prime Day earlier this month. Dave Fildes : Yes. Jason, on your second question related to the international and the profitability there, reported there's a foreign exchange exposure there on that segment with the operating income, there's included in there about $231 million of unfavorable impact to that segment included in that $1.7 billion loss for the quarter. Just looking \u2013 broadly speaking at what's going on with that business and the losses that we're seeing there in the investments, I think it's important to remember it's early in many of our international countries, particularly in some of our emerging or more recent launch countries, places like India, Brazil, the Middle East, there are others as well, of course, but where we've been operating in many of those cases considerably shorter than the tenure we've had in the U.S. In our established international locations, UK, Germany, Japan, over time, we've continued to improve the profitability of that business as we build out and established stronger customer relationships and work on the cost structure and how we serve folks. A lot of that, of course, is driving improvements through our key pillars with price selection and convenience and working with vendors on commercial terms. In our emerging locations, there's a healthy amount of investment we've done to drive expansion. And we expect to continue to do that, given the strong competition across many of these markets and that's investments in Prime Video, not just in some of the flagship shows that are kind of sourced here in the U.S., but also you've seen us continue to push for opportunities for in-country and local language the video content that resonates with customers and can be a meaningful reason people sign-up for the Prime program, engage and renew. And we're also investing depending on the regions and kind of the local infrastructure [indiscernible], whether it's building out payment methods, third-party transportation services, even in some cases, the Internet and the telecom infrastructure. So we're playing a role along with others. It's not just us investing in ways to create and enable that infrastructure to be successful. So those are some of the opportunities and challenges that you think about kind of where we are in the U.S. versus international that are out there. The network complexities, of course, there are some regulatory hurdles and other differences out there. But we think it's important to continue to invest in those opportunities and learn from what we're \u2013 not just in what we've done in the history with the U.S., but also in many of these countries and keep that flywheel spinning and continue to serve customers in more efficient ways. Operator : Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Youssef Squali : Great. Thank you. I have two questions. One, can you discuss the impact, the price action you took on Prime, on merchant fees, et cetera, had on retention during the quarter, and do you feel that that's enough to offset the inflationary pressure we're seeing to date? And then on Buy with Prime, I know it's early, but how do you see the rollout of this initiative from it being by invitation only today to all merchants using FBA to \u2013 Amazon merchants, et cetera, and just kind of the implications on \u2013 broader implications on the business from that initiative? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Thank you, Youssef. So first on the \u2013 let's take them one at a time. So on the Prime fee increase earlier in the year, we're happy with the results we're seeing in the Prime program. Prime membership and retention is still strong. I think that change has been above our expectations positively. And I think the benefit of the program continues to get better and better. And as I mentioned in-stocks never been higher, delivery speed is increasing. So not to mention a lot of the new content, especially on the video side that will be coming in the fall. So we feel good about the program and the state of the Prime members after a very rough couple years of pandemic turmoil. And we think it's good base to build upon. So on the seller fee again, we added that fee grudgingly in May to compensate for some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. I don't want to give you the idea that either of those fee increases came close to covering our costs. You can see from our operating results, some of it's internal related, but a lot of it's external factors that they're \u2013 we are not passing through that at a 100% to external groups. And it\u2019s \u2013 we've got to work our way out of the condition we are in and we are making good progress in Q2 and expect to keep pressing on that in the second half of the year, but saw strength in the seller results in Q2, as we mentioned on the percentage mix. So I think, seller business remain strong in an integral part of our customer offering. Dave Fildes : Youssef, this is Dave. On your Buy with Prime question, yes, I mean, right now, it's allowing U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants on the online stores. And it's what they experience, they expect and kind of come to expect with Amazon that's the fast free delivery that seamless checkout and the free returns on orders that are eligible. Right now the program is available, as you mentioned, invitation-only for merchants that are already using FBA. And it'll expand throughout this year as we'll extend more merchants to invite and participate in the program. We're interested in learning and working with FBA sellers that we've known and had good trust with, but also expanding. And I think as you think about it, merchants, they obviously have a lot of choices on where they're going to sell products. And we have a long history of empowering and helping merchants. We've invested a lot in tools and capabilities, and of course, the delivery capabilities and all the things that go along with that. But that's an opportunity for us to support merchants who may or may not be FBA sellers with the tools and the opportunity just to sell their products online and scale their business and build their brand. And so I think I\u2019m really excited about, of course, getting to be able to launch this program over the last few months and dialing it up for more sellers as the year progresses. Operator : Our final question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you. So Brian, I think you just reported a quarter-on-quarter decline on headcount, which was by design after what happened last quarter, but it won't be too long before you are gearing up for the holidays. So how do you think the environment is going to fair for you to be adding headcount? And also the stock-based compensation came in below, where you had guided for the second quarter. So is this a matter of not hitting the hiring goals you were hoping for, or do you think the environment for the hiring of technical and engineering talent is losing up a little bit? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Stephen. Thank you. On the headcount, yes, I think it was more as we mentioned last quarter \u2013 last year \u2013 excuse me, in Q1, we added \u2013 to give you a flavor for it, we added 14,000 workers in Q1, prior year we had reduced our net headcount by 27,000. So we\u2019re pretty transparent about the fact that we had hired a lot of people in Q1 for the coverage of the Omicron variant, luckily that variant subsided and we were left with a higher headcount position that has come down through adjusting our hiring levels and normal attrition and \u2013 was pretty much resolved by the end of April or early part of May. So that is dominating the quarter-over-quarter reduction in headcount. I would note that we're still up 188,000 year-over-year and nearly double the headcount of what we had heading into the pandemic in early 2020. So you're right, there will be adjustments to that as we move forward into more holiday level demand. Right now, we see a stabilization in the workforce, maybe we see good hiring rates. And so I think as you remember, there was a very difficult labor period in the second half of last year, and it didn't arrived kind of quickly out of nowhere. So we're certainly diligent on that and making sure we have a good workplace and an environment that will attract employees. Dave Fildes : And Stephen on your \u2013 just to your question on stock-based comp, as you mentioned, we do utilize restricted stock units or RSU as our primary mode of equity compensation. And as we always remind you, employee annual RSU grants do occur in the second quarter. And as a result, we typically see a step-up in the SBC expense from Q1 to Q2 and of course, you saw it this time around. The growth in the line is impacted overall also on the step-up by continued headcount. We've grown our workforce over the last few years. And as Brian talked about hiring in a number of areas of the business, including engineers, other tech workers, and there's some component of the wage inflation as we look to continue to hire and retain employees there. In terms of the coming in at the five \u2013 little over $5 billion for stock-based comp, the main driver there was primarily driven by fewer employees stock awards vested \u2013 excuse me, fewer employee stock awards we\u2019re vesting in Q2 than we expected. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again, next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.",

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.  For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2022 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining today's call. Before we move to questions, I will make some comments about our Q3 performance and the outlook for Q4. For the third quarter, worldwide net sales were $127.1 billion, representing an increase of 19% year-over-year, excluding approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. As the dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, the foreign exchange impact was higher than the 390 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q3 guidance. This represents a headwind of approximately $900 million, more than we initially guided to. Throughout the quarter, our worldwide stores business continued to stay highly focused on our customers and driving the inputs that matter most, which helped to accelerate sales growth in the quarter. We now offer our widest selection ever. We've taken actions that have driven strong recovery of in-stock rates, and we continue to work on improving delivery speeds, all while ensuring our pricing remains sharp for our customers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offering for consumers, representing 58% of total paid units sold in Q3, the highest percentage ever. It's up from 56% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, our US conference for selling partners, where we introduced new tools, including new e-mail marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping rates and new features and analytics to help sellers better understand and act on conversion-driving content. This was a big quarter for Prime members. We celebrated our eighth Prime Day in July, which contributed approximately 400 basis points to our Q3 year-over-year sales growth rate. Prime members purchased more than 300 million items worldwide, making it the biggest Prime Day net sales event in Amazon's history. As a reminder, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter of 2021. We also debut the two largest Prime Video releases ever. The Lord of the Rings : The Rings of Power attracted more than 25 million global viewers on its first day. And in the first two months since its launch, Rings of Power has driven more Prime sign-ups globally than any other Amazon Original. NFL Thursday Night Football also premiered in September, averaging more than 15 million viewers during its first broadcast, and driving the three biggest hours of US Prime sign-ups in the history of Amazon. Our next broadcast, the seventh of the 15-game schedule, kicks off in a few hours, with the Ravens visiting the Buccaneers. We also saw good growth in our advertising offerings where sales grew 30% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange as vendors and sellers have embraced our portfolio of products, which allow advertisers to build general awareness and/or drive sales of a specific product. In AWS, net sales increased to $20.5 billion in Q3, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and now representing an annualized sales run rate of $82 billion. With the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling costs. And we're proactively working to help customers cost optimize, just as we've done throughout AWS' history, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. The breadth and depth of our service offerings enable us to help them do things like move storage to lower-priced tiers options and shift workloads to our Graviton chips. Graviton3 processors delivered 40% better price performance than comparable x86-based instances. And our teams across AWS continue to work relentlessly to expand that breadth and depth, including recent launches of new EC2 machine learning training instances in AWS IoT fleet-wise. And we continue to expand the AWS infrastructure footprint to support customers with the launch of the AWS Middle East region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific region in Thailand. Now, let's shift to operating income. During the quarter, we reported $2.5 billion in operating income. Turning first to our North America and international segments, during the quarter, we generated over $1 billion in operations cost improvements driven by higher leverage of our fixed cost base and continued productivity improvements in our fulfillment and transportation networks. This represents a solid improvement in productivity quarter-over-quarter, though not quite as much as we had planned. We are encouraged by the progress made during the quarter, but we recognize there's still a lot of opportunity to continue to improve productivity and drive cost efficiencies throughout our networks. We have identified initiatives that the teams continue to work hard on, and we expect to see further improvement in the quarters ahead. Another impact to operating income was the step-up in Prime Video content and marketing costs in Q3, primarily driven by the global premiere of the Rings of Power and the launch of the NFL Thursday Night Football package in the United States. Our results were also negatively impacted by non-recurring charges related to the closure of certain businesses and products such as Amazon Care, Fabric.com and Amazon Explore. We continue to ramp up our investments in AWS, adding product builders and sales and professional services headcount to help customers save money, invent more quickly in their businesses and transition to the cloud. We're also continuing to invest in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, expanding to new geographic regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Overall stock-based compensation expense was $5.6 billion in Q3, up from $5.2 billion in the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated forfeiture rate on certain unvested stock awards. We reported overall net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $1.1 billion included in non-operating income from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, the impact of this investment to our income statement is driven by quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. Now let's discuss capital investments, which is the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2022, we expect to incur approximately $60 billion in capital investments, which is broadly in line with what we spent in 2021. This represents an estimated reduction in fulfillment and transportation capital investments of approximately $10 billion compared to last year, as we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with demand. And this is offset by an approximately $10 billion year-over-year increase in technology infrastructure, primarily to support the rapid growth, innovation and continued expansion of our AWS footprint. We also provided our fourth quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. While we are encouraged by our progress across the business, macroeconomic environment remains challenging worldwide. The continuing impacts of broad-scale inflation, heightened fuel prices and rising energy costs have impacted our sales growth as consumers assess their purchasing power and organizations of all sizes evaluate their technology and advertising spend. As the third quarter progressed, we saw moderating sales growth across many of our businesses as well as the increased foreign currency headwinds, I mentioned earlier, and we expect these impacts to persist throughout the fourth quarter. As we've done at similar times in our history, we're also taking actions to tighten our belt, including pausing hiring in certain businesses and winding down products and services where we believe our resources are better spent elsewhere. We aim to strike the right balance between investing for our customers for the long-term, while driving operational efficiency improvements and accomplishing more with less. When faced with an uncertain economy or some kind of discontinuous event, customers tend to double-down on companies that they believe have the best customer experience and that take care of them the best. And that is where our efforts remain focused. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. We kicked off the season a few weeks ago with our first-ever Prime Early Access sales event where tens of millions of Prime members shopped and ordered more than 100 million items from Amazon's selling partners. We remain heads-down focused on driving a fantastic customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, let's move on to your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Brian, maybe I'll just ask a two-parter with respect to the revenue guide for Q4. Can you help us better understand some of the comments you made around the exit velocity, specifically with respect to the US e-commerce business or the AWS business and how that might inform, some of the lower-than-seasonal trends that seem to be implied in the Q4 guide, specifically with respect to either optimizations on the AWS side or changes in consumption behavior on the US e-commerce side? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Sure thing, Eric. Thanks for your question. As I look ahead to guidance for Q4, I think the biggest individual factor is still going to be foreign exchange. This guidance includes 460 basis points of unfavorable impact year-over-year. FX is a bigger issue for us on our revenue growth in dollars than it is on our income. It actually has a slight favorability due to the investments we're making internationally. But put that aside for a moment. What we saw in Q3 was a really strong July with a great reaction to Prime Day globally. And the resumption of things like in-stock rates are starting to come back, and delivery speed was coming back. And that continued through the quarter, but growth rates started to slow a bit. And primarily in the consumer stores business, it was in international. North America, obviously, it was strong, but it started to slow a bit. But it was mostly in international where we saw the biggest impact, and we think that is tied to a tougher recessionary environment there. Compared to the US, it's worse in Europe right now. The Ukraine war and the energy crisis issues have really compounded in that geography. But when I talk about enterprise customers in AWS, yes, we've been working with customers to lower their bills. Just like all companies, they want to lower their spend when they're faced with uncertainty in the market. I would say one that's real valuable points about cloud computing is that it's turning fixed cost into variable for many of our customers, and we help them save money either through alternative services or Graviton3 chips. There's many ways that we have to help them lower their spending and still get great cost performance ratios. So what we're really excited about the business, both in the long term and even in the short run, you noticed we've added $4.5 billion to the $16 billion base we had of revenue last Q3, so the business is growing in absolute dollars at a really good clip. We do see some of the consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save money in the short run. I would say that although we had a 28% growth rate for the quarter for AWS, the back end of the quarter, we were more in the mid-20% growth rate. So we've carried that forecast through to the fourth quarter. We're not sure how it's going to play out, but that's generally our assumption. We're excited about the re :Invent conference that's coming up in late November. We expect to have over 40,000 people in Las Vegas and many more tuning in virtually. So continue to drive value for customers with new products, new services and, lately also, additional ways for them to manage their budgets and optimize in what is shaping up as a tough economy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, free cash flow generation has always been Amazon's focus in the past, but that went negative last year and likely this year as well. Can you just talk about the path to restoring meaningful free cash flow? And do you think that CapEx tied to data centers and the AWS ramp can ultimately step back, similar to what we've seen recently with fulfillment and transport? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. I think if you look at our free cash flow, there's multiple factors here. One is the drop-off in income for the trailing 12 months versus the 12 months before it, and a lot of that is driven to things that we've talked about on these calls. Ops cost, we\u2019re still not in a -- our network doubled over the last 2.5 years. While we're making strides in productivity and network optimization, we still work to do there. So we have to get our cost structure back to pre-pandemic levels in a lot of areas of the company and mostly in operations. There's a unique thing going on with inventory right now because we have a lot of weeks of cover mainly due to supply chain issues coming out of Asia primarily and we're seeing with our sellers, too. We just have additional weeks of cover. We think our model reacts quickly to customer demand. This is more about the other side of the equation, the supply chain and having more in stock. So what the issue there is that we generally have a favorable working capital impact from accounts payable that is more days than our inventory. That's been flipping the last year, and we expect that to normalize as we move into 2023. And then CapEx is a big driver. We had, again, a doubling of the network, had very high CapEx the last two years. You'll see that we've lowered CapEx year-over-year. We probably cut about one-third of our budget from what we originally thought for 2022 while still focusing our capital dollars really on the AWS business and increasing customer demand or capacity for increasing customer demand in our stores business. So we're working hard on all those dimensions. And we expect, as we see a recovery in income generation, normalization of the inventory versus accounts payable cycle and efficiency in our CapEx spend, we intend to flip those numbers around. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : Let me ask two profit questions. AWS margins were a little lower than we would have thought. Is that just a reflection of the full quarter impact of that stock-based compensation granted to those employees earlier in the year? Is that the new normal for AWS margins? And then international losses also were a little bit heavier than we thought, just talk about what drove those losses. And is that also the new normal for that segment? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with AWS. So we did see a deceleration or a drop in op margin sequentially quarter-over-quarter. The broad disclaimer on AWS margins is that they will fluctuate over time as we balance investments versus renegotiating pricing with the long-term customer commitments, all as headwinds to the business, offset by increasing productivity and efficiencies in our data centers, which drive profitability. So there's moving parts there. I'd say what's happening lately is, yes, the stock-based comp. We have seen inflation in our wages this year and particularly on our Czech employees is heavily concentrated in AWS. So that's one element of it. We're also seeing energy costs that are materially higher than they had in pre-pandemic, electricity and the impact of natural gas pricing. So those prices have up more than 2x over the last couple of years and contribute to about 200 basis point degradation versus 2 years ago. So we're fighting through some of that as well, which is a new thing for the AWS business. But we'll continue to look for ways to optimize our operations to use less energy. And as we scale, we'll outrun that growth trajectory. On international, international is always a mix of profitability in more established countries of Europe and Japan, offset by emerging countries and investments in Prime benefits. I think the biggest issue quarter-over-quarter, the increase in losses versus Q2 was tied to some additional operating costs in Europe. We've seen higher fuel costs there, even more certainly in the United States. And Prime Day always has lesser profitability because there's just a lot of deals. And it's a bit of margin from Prime Day in both North America and international. So a big part of that is device sales. And again, we sell a lot of devices during our Prime Day events. We don't make money on the device. We make money on the use of the device. So that always can end up hurting profitability in the quarter. So there are some contributing things. As far as new normal, we're working very hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal, and we'll see how quickly we can make improvements. A lot of the improvements that I talked about on a macro level, capital efficiency, operations improvements are as important internationally as they are in North America. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brent Thill : Brian, on AWS, I'm just curious when you talk about optimizing and efficiency, can you talk to what you're seeing from your customers why perhaps you're seeing such a big pullback in terms of near-term demand? How would you characterize those conversations? And I think the other question is related to backlog. Backlog has been running 60-plus percent, so the divergence between revenue and backlog is pretty large. Everyone's asking, how do you describe that divergence? Brian Olsavsky : Let me have Dave answer the backlog question first. Dave Fildes : Yeah. It's Dave here. So I think our current backlog balance for Q3 is $104 billion. So it's about a little less than 60%, I think about 57% up year-over-year. And the new customer pipeline is healthy. I think with a lot of enterprises and customers, they're continuing to put plans in place. I think Brian will talk a little bit about some of the cost optimization in a second. Backlog growth, this figure, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter because it is dependent on the commitments that you sign in the period and how those adjust but, yes, $104.3 billion for the end of Q3. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. And your first question about cost optimization, first, there are some industries that have lower demand that's showing up in our volumes as probably like other companies as well, things like financial services, the mortgage business being down, cryptocurrencies being down. We're very strong in some of those industries, and that's part of it. But basically, what we see is customers are looking to save money versus their committed spend. We have options for them to do that. They can manage workloads better. They can switch to lower-cost products that have different performance profiles. They can switch to Graviton chips that have higher cost performance ratios. So, all really good things for the customer and for Amazon long-term. Again, we think the benefit of cloud computing is really showing up right now, because we allow customers to turn what can normally be a fixed expense into a variable expense, and they can let us manage the highs and lows of inflation and other cost of electricity and everything else. And they can get about to do their business using our services in a very highly secure way. So, I think just like in 2020, these time periods are good for long-term adoption on cloud computing. But the offset in the short run is that some companies have demand that drops. I think what was different in 2020 was there were companies that went down and there's companies that went up quite a bit that were servicing high volumes during the pandemic. So, that dynamic is not in place right now, and I think everyone is just cautious and they want to, again, watch their spend. And as CFO, I appreciate that, and we're doing the same thing here at Amazon. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. John Blackledge : That\u2019s great. Thanks. Two questions. First, could you provide some more details on the cost structure initiatives, and when we could see those initiatives hitting the P&L? And then second, on the holiday season. It's a bit implicit in your guide and remarks thus far, but just curious of your expectations for consumer demand this holiday season versus last year. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure. Let me start with the holiday. So, we're ready to roll. We've got the best selection we've ever had. In-stock levels are really high. Delivery speeds are getting very close to where we want them to be. And we're ready to have a really good holiday season with our consumers this year. And the Prime Early Access sale, I think, created great value for consumers. It allowed them to get a jump on some of their purchases for the holiday and also just find some great deals. So, we're happy with that effort. And the teams that put that together worked very hard this year to hold two large Prime events within four months. So, we're very optimistic about the holiday. But we're realistic that there's various factors weighing on people's wallets, and we're not quite sure how strong holiday spending will be versus last year. And we're ready for a variety of outcomes. But we know the consumers when they're looking for good deals, and that positions us well. Advertisers are looking for effective advertising. And our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend. So we have a lot of advantages that we feel that will help both consumers and also our partners like sellers and advertisers. So the seller in-stock is very high. We've had great in-stocks from our FBA sellers. And so we're ready to go. And we're very optimistic about the fourth quarter, just realistic about whether we may have a range of outcomes that we just have to be ready for when we are. On the cost structure initiatives, I think you're primarily talking about the operations world. We made -- there's three large buckets there, as I've said in the past, productivity, fixed cost leverage and inflation. On productivity, made good strides, but there's still a lot of work to do there and we know the job ahead of us. It's hard to improve productivity much in the fourth quarter, because it's just a period of like maximum stress on the operations, and we're trying to fulfill every order in a very quick way. But we\u2019re -- our goal is to leave ourselves in a really good, strong condition for a fast start on a lot of initiatives in Q1 of next year. On fixed cost leverage, we've taken steps to alter our forward plan and take CapEx out. A lot of the CapEx we spend in any given year is feeding future years' capability. And we've tightened that up. We feel good about the arc of demand versus supply that we have in our fulfillment and transportation area. Inflation is a wildcard. We do as much as we can to save money in an inflationary environment. We've looked to make sure that our trucks are fully utilized as best we can, preventing long-zone shipments, things that like use a lot of fuel or use a lot of trucking or use a lot of shipments from other parts of the world. So we're working under the umbrella of not having it impact the customer. We're working very hard to save that. Those challenges will be there through the end of the year, and we'll be working on them definitely in the first half of next year as well. So we'll keep you posted as we have these quarterly calls on our progress and where we see opportunities. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Just two clarifications on what you just said. So, first, on retail, you did see some good efficiency gains in 3Q, and you talked about $1.5 billion. As we look forward, if those three areas you just mentioned do turn favorable, how quickly do you think you could get back to kind of historical North America retail operating margins? Is that 1 year, two years? Any time frame on that? And then, on AWS, you said the back half of 3Q was a mid-20s run rate. One of your prominent peers was talking about incremental macro weakness in 4Q. So could you just talk about, are you expecting the same thing in 4Q, or are some of the price concessions you already made in 3Q kind of getting in front of that? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Was that second question on AWS, Ross? Ross Sandler : Yes, AWS trajectory. Exactly. Brian Olsavsky : Okay. Let me start with the efficiency. I just outlined a lot of it in the prior answer. But just to clarify, we were aiming for about $1.5 billion improvements sequentially versus Q2 and Q3. We feel like we came up about $0.5 billion short on that. Primarily -- mostly in our productivity we have a lot of -- with the Prime Day and the preparations for the Prime Early Access event, we have been running with very high inventory levels in our warehouses. But our inventory and our sellers, as we get ready for those events, paid off in the events themselves. In-stocks have been at really high levels. But in that environment, it's a little harder to work on. There's, blockages to making improvement in productivity. There's a lot of extra work when you have space constraints. But we will continue that fight. And while I can't forecast into 2023 yet, and I'm not really only talking about Q4. My message is that we have work to do in 2023, that we are aware of and working on today. Dave, do you want to take that question on AWS? Dave Fildes : Yeah, this is Dave. Ross, you were just asking around AWS. There's nothing really I'd add to what Brian had already said other than he's spoken about. We've seen the year-over-year growth rate come down as the third quarter progressed and exited in sort of the mid-20s growth rate. And so that's informed how we're thinking about the guidance ranges heading into the fourth quarter, but nothing else to add on that. End of Q&A: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon. And we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you everyone. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a great day.",

And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2023 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining today's call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I will make some comments about our Q4 results. Let's start with revenue.  For the fourth quarter, worldwide net sales were $149.2 billion, representing an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding approximately 360 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and above the top end of our Q4 guidance range. We've seen that during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers are very careful about how they allocate their resources and where they choose to spend their money.  Throughout Amazon's history, we have found that our focus on the customer helps to set us apart in times like these. This past holiday season, customers came to Amazon for great deals, fast delivery and our widest-ever selection, bolstered by nearly 2 million third-party seller partners who sell on Amazon. Enterprise customers continued their multi-decade shift to the cloud while working closely with our AWS teams to thoughtfully identify opportunities to reduce costs and optimize their work.  In our worldwide stores business, with the ongoing economic uncertainty, coupled with the continuation of inflationary pressures, customers remain cautious about their spending behavior. We saw them spend less on discretionary categories and shift to lower-priced items and value brands in categories like electronics. We also saw them continue to spend on everyday essentials, such as consumables, beauty and softlines. Our teams worked hard to offer low prices and secure millions of deals for customers in Q4, including our first-ever Prime Early Access Sale in October and the more traditional Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday holiday weekend. These global sales events outperformed our expectations as customers responded to millions of deals across our growing selection. Third-party sellers remain a key contributor to that expanding selection. In Q4, sellers comprised a record 59% of overall unit sales. Sellers, vendors and brands continue to look to Amazon's advertising capabilities to reach customers in the always competitive holiday season, even as the macro environment required them to scrutinize their own marketing budgets.  We saw good growth in advertising revenues in Q4, up 23% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Prime membership continues to be a great value for our customers, and improving our Prime benefits is a continuous part of our investment strategy. Along with competitive pricing, broad selection and faster delivery speed, we've seen Prime members respond to our expanding entertainment offerings. During the quarter, we completed our first season of The Lord of the Rings : The Rings of Power, the most watched Amazon original series in every region of the world, reaching over 100 million viewers and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content. We also finished our inaugural season as the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football, reaching the youngest median age audience of any NFL broadcast package since 2013 and increasing viewership by 11% from last year among hard-to-reach 18- to 34-year-olds.  In aggregate, we invested approximately $7 billion in 2022 across Amazon Originals, live sports and licensed third-party video content included with Prime. That's up from about $5 billion in 2021. As a reminder, these digital video content costs are included in cost of sales on our income statement. We regularly evaluate the return on the spend and continue to be encouraged by what we see, as video has proven to be a strong driver of Prime member engagement and new Prime member acquisition.  Moving on to AWS. Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions. As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term.  As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens. That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.  Now let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the quarter, we reported $2.7 billion in operating income. The operating income was negatively impacted by 3 large items, which added approximately $2.7 billion of costs in the quarter. This was related to employee severance, impairments of property and equipment and operating leases and changes in estimates related to self-insurance liabilities. This cost primarily impacted our North America segment. If we had not incurred these charges in Q4, our operating income would have been approximately $5.4 billion. We are encouraged with the progress we continue to make in streamlining the costs in our Amazon stores business. We entered the quarter with labor more appropriately matched to demand across our operations network compared to Q4 of last year, allowing us to have the right labor in the right place at the right time and drive productivity gains.  We also saw continued efficiencies across our transportation network, where process and tech improvements resulted in higher Amazon Logistics productivity and improved line haul fill rates. While transportation overperformed expectations in the quarter, we also saw productivity improvements across our fulfillment centers, in line with our plan.  We also saw good leverage driven by strong holiday volumes. Overall, it was a strong effort by the operations team, and we look forward to making further headway as we head into 2023. We remain focused on driving cost efficiencies throughout the network and reducing our cost to serve our customers, while ensuring we maintain an outstanding customer experience.  Circling back to the 3 large charges during the quarter. Let me share some additional color, starting with the job eliminations we initiated during the fourth quarter. As we consider the ongoing uncertainties of the macroeconomic environment, this led us to the difficult decision to eliminate just over 18,000 roles, primarily impacting our stores and device businesses as well as our human resources teams. As a result, we recorded estimated severance cost of $640 million. These charges were recorded primarily in technology and content, fulfillment and general administration on our income statement.  Next, we recorded impairments of property and equipment and operating leases, primarily related to our Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go physical stores. We're continuously refining our store formats to find the ones that will resonate with customers, will build our grocery brand and will allow us to scale meaningfully over time. As such, we periodically access our portfolio of stores and decided to exit certain stores with low growth potential. We'll also take an impairment on capitalized costs and associated values of our leased buildings. The impairment charge in Q4 was $720 million and is included in other operating expense on our income statement.  We continue to believe grocery is a significant opportunity, and we're focused on serving customers through multiple channels, whether that's online delivery, pickup or in-store shopping. Lastly, during the quarter, we increased our reserves for general product and automobile self-insurance liabilities, driven by changes in our estimates about the cost of asserted and unasserted claims, resulting in additional expense of $1.3 billion. This impact is primarily recorded in cost of sales on our income statement.  As our business has grown quickly over the last several years, particularly as we've built out our fulfillment and transportation network and claim amounts have seen industry-wide inflation, we've continued to evaluate and adjust this reserve for both asserted claims as well as our estimate for unasserted claims.  We reported overall net income of $278 million in the fourth quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $2.3 billion included in nonoperating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations but rather the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price.  As we head into the new year, we remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. Andrew Jassy : Everybody, this is Andy. Just before we start with the questions, I just wanted to say it's good to be with you all on the call today. I thought I might jump on the calls from time to time moving forward. And given that this last quarter was the end of my first full year in this role, and given some of the unusual parts in the economy and our business, I thought this might be a good one to join. So thanks for having me. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. Andy, I want to ask you, just the first one, you've been in the seat for a while. As you sit there, what are your key focal points, product categories or investment priorities that you're most focused on to drive durable multiyear growth in that North America retail segment as we recover?  And then the second one, just sort of staying on the North America retail side, how do you think about the potential margin potential of that business over the next few years as you sort of grow into the warehouse? And what are the warehouse network? And what are the efficiency factors to get you to those goals? Brian Olsavsky : Brian, this is Brian. First, let me just start with your second question. On the -- sorry, can you hear me? On the expectation for retail margins, especially in North America, what we've said is when we look back to our cost structure pre-pandemic, we were just in the end of 2019, early part of 2020. We're just starting to roll out one-day shipping in North America, and we had an expectation of what our cost structure would look like. That has changed quite a bit in the last 3 years now due to a doubling of our network expansion. I think you've heard me tell this story on different calls.  But essentially, we're now trying to, again, regain our cost structure that we've had in the past, balance the -- and get more efficient on the assets we've added in the last 2, 3 years now and also look at all the investment areas that we are working on to drive growth, continuing to look at them where we need to make course corrections, where we need to change things up. And we expect that, again, a lot of the improvement will be in North America operations costs. We made good headway in 2022. We always want to make more, and we're going to be working on this definitely through 2023 and beyond. But we hope to make and expect to make big improvements in 2023. Andrew Jassy : Yes. And I'll start just at a broad level, priority-wise, the connective tissue for everything we do across the company, including in stores in North America, is we realize that we exist to make customers' lives better and easier every day and relentlessly went to do so. And being maniacally focused on the customer experiences, always going to be a top priority for us. At the same time, and this is true in North America as well as across the entire business, we're working really hard to streamline our costs and trying to do so at the same time that we don't give up on the long-term strategic investments that we believe can meaningfully change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over the long term.  As I addressed directly the North American stores questions, I think our -- probably the #1 priority that I spent time with the team on is reducing our cost to serve in our operations network. And as Brian touched on, it's important to remember that over the last few years, we've -- we took a fulfillment center footprint that we've built over 25 years and doubled it in just a couple of years. And then we, at the same time, built out a transportation network for last mile roughly the size of UPS in a couple of years. And so when you do both of those things to meet the huge surge in demand, you're going to -- just to get those functional, it took everything we had. And so there's a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient and more productive.  And then I think at the same time, if you think about doubling the number of fulfillment centers you have and then adding a very large transportation network and you realize that all of those facilities have to link together to get products to customers, that's a pretty big expansion in the number of nodes in the network. It becomes a little bit different network. And so to figure out how to be really efficient across all those links and have them be highly utilized and to get the flows in those facilities working the right way, it takes time. So we're working very hard on it. I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q4, and you can see that in some of the results. But that work will extend into '23. So that's first.  I think the second thing, priority-wise, I would talk about is just speed. We believe that continuing to get products to customers faster, makes customers happier, and they also converted a higher rate when they can see promises of deliveries that are faster. I think selection will always be a very high area of focus for us. We work with hundreds of thousands in the U.S. and millions overall in the world of selling partners. In this past quarter, 59% of the units sold were from our third-party selling partners, and we work very hard to provide unmatched selection. And that matters a lot to customers.  I think pricing being sharp is always important. But particularly in this type of uncertain economy, where customers are very conscious about how much they're spending, having the millions of deals that we put together with our selling partners in the fourth quarter was an important part of the demand that you saw, and we'll continue to work really hard on being sharp on pricing.  And then just the customer experience improvements that we're working all the time, whether it's adding Buy with Prime that allows Prime users to use their Prime benefits on other websites than just Amazon; or adding RxPass in the health care space, where our Prime customers for $5 a month can get all the medicines they're using in unlimited fashion; or whether it's just even in our apparel business, where when you're looking clothing you might buy, being able to see virtually your shoes with that outfit to see how it looks and it changes your customer experience, your buying experience, we will continue to work very hard on those customer experiences, and we have a lot more planned. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Also for Andy, I have two. Just first, how would you evaluate your efforts in grocery thus far? I know you're -- it's a big, huge market. You're attacking it different ways. What are the key steps here that you're focused on to drive greater market share?  And then secondly, how should we think about the strategic importance of some of these emerging bets type of areas like health care and Kuiper and autonomous vehicles, among others? Andrew Jassy : On the first one on grocery, I'd just start by saying that we think grocery is a really important and strategic area for us. It's a very large market segment, and there's a lot of frequency in how consumers shop for grocery. And we also believe that over time, grocery is going to be omnichannel. There are going to be a lot of people that order their grocery items online and have it delivered to them, and there are going to be a lot of people who continue to buy in physical stores. But you're going to also see a hybrid of those, where people pick out what they want online and pick it up in stores, or people are in stores and there's something that's not in inventory in the stores, so they go to their app or to a kiosk and order it to be delivered from online. And so I think having omnichannel is going to really matter.  And I think that we have a pretty significant-sized grocery business. I think people sometimes don't realize that and that we've been building for a long time. It's continuing to accelerate, and I kind of see it broken into a few pieces. If you think about the online grocery offering, we have a very large business there. It looks different from the typical mega physical grocery store. But if you think about the aisles in a grocery store, from packaged food to paper products to canned goods to pet supplies to health and personal care items to consumables, we have a very large business there that continues to grow at a rapid clip and then we think will continue to grow. But it doesn't have a big market segment share in perishables. And if you really want to have significant market segment share in perishables, you typically need physical stores. And we have kind of 2 different offerings there. For what I think is the very best organic physical store experience and selection, we have Whole Foods, which is a very significant-sized business that's continuing to grow. I really like the progress that, that business has made on profitability in the last year. And I like what I see in front of it, and I think that's a very -- it's a premium product, but it's a significant business. It's a good business for us in the grocery space.  I think if you want to have a mass physical store offering, you need a different offering. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh, and we have a few dozen stores so far. We're doing a fair bit of experimentation today in those stores to try to find a format that we think resonates with customers. It's differentiated in some meaningful fashion and where we like the economics. And we've been -- we've decided over the last year or so that we're not going to expand the physical Fresh doors until we have that equation with differentiation and economic value that we like, but we're optimistic that we're going to find that in 2023. We're working hard at it. We see some encouraging signs. And when we do find that equation, we will expand it more expansively. But I think that we have a very significant opportunity in the grocery segment. I think we're building a pretty broad grocery network across online and physical, and you're going to see us continue to work on it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe I'll ask one big picture of Andy and then just a housekeeping matter to Brian, if I can. Andy, keeping on this theme of sort of big picture and strategy and your perspective, I'd love to get your view on the international e-commerce businesses. Obviously, you're in a range of geographies with a wide variance of maturity and different investment cycles. Can you give us your perspective on how you see Amazon's global e-commerce footprint today? And how investors should be thinking about the mix of growth and margin evolution in those international businesses in the years ahead?  And maybe, Brian, if I can just ask a quick follow-up. In the Q1 operating income guidance that you gave, I think there's some confusion among investors as to where you might be capturing some of the restructuring charges from the announcements that the company has made on employee count between Q4 and Q1. Can you just clarify what was captured in Q4 versus what might be included in the way you frame the Q1 operating income guidance? Brian Olsavsky : Sure, let me start. This is Brian. Let me start with that second part. So as I said earlier, we took a $640 million charge tied to the position elimination that we announced in Q4. A lot of that fell into Q1 into mid to late January. So the way to think about it is for the terminations in January, the salaries for the first 3 weeks are covered in operating results for Q1. But the period after that, where there's weeks or months of severance coverage, job placement, a lot of those costs are what the $640 million charge was in Q4. So I hope that helps. Andrew Jassy : And on the question about international e-commerce, we're very enthusiastic about the business we're building there. I think just perspective, if you look at the compounded annual growth rate from 2019 to '21, in the U.K., it was over 30%; in Germany, it was 26%; in Japan, it was 21%. And the fact that we haven't given back that growth, and these are all net of FX, but if you look at even the last couple of quarters where we're continuing to grow and we haven't given back some of that growth, a meaningful amount of market segment share has shifted to our global established e-commerce territories, and we're excited about that.  Now we're -- at this stage, we're big enough in our developed international territories that when there's something significant happening in the macro, we're going to be impacted as well. And if you just look in Europe as an example, the inflation is higher than most places, and the impact on Europeans for the war in Ukraine is more significant, and also the energy prices and hikes there are more significant. So you can see that in some of our growth numbers.  And then you look at our emerging countries, and these are -- they're all a little bit different in all -- in a little bit different stage as you recognize in the question. But if you look at countries like India and Brazil and the Middle East and Africa and Turkey, Mexico and Australia and a number of those types of countries, we like what we're seeing. They take a certain amount of time. There's a certain amount of fixed investment you have to make when you enter a new geography, and then you have to drive a certain amount of revenue to be able to cover that fixed investment. But they're all on the right trajectory and following trajectories that roughly look like what we saw in North America and our established international geographies, and we think it's the right investment and believe we're going to have a large profitable international e-commerce business. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Great. Maybe one for Andy and then one for Brian. AWS, if you look at the revenue growth of mid-teens, it implies it could be flattish and even down this quarter. So maybe talk about what's driving that. Is it workload changes? Are there some clients that are shifting? Anything on the market share you could comment on?  And then second, when do you think this could recover? Like what's the time frame? And would you expect margins to come back when revenues reaccelerate? I'll leave it at that. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Justin, for your question. This is Brian. Let me start with the -- what we're seeing at the customer level. So as I've mentioned, continuing -- it's across all industries. There are some points of weakness, things like financial services, like mortgage companies that do. As mortgage volumes down, some of their compute challenges or compute volumes are down. Crypto is -- lower trading in crypto. And things tied to advertising, as there's lower advertising spend, there's less analytics and compute on advertising spend as well.  But -- so there's . But by and large, what we're seeing is just an interest and a priority by our customers to get their spend down as they enter an economic downturn. We're doing the same thing at Amazon, questioning our infrastructure expenses as well as everything else. And we -- there's things you can do. You can defer -- you can switch to lower-cost products. You can run calculations less frequently. There's just -- you can do different types of storage on your data. So there's ways to alter your cost and your bill in a short period of time. I think that's what we're seeing. And as I said, we're working with our customers to help them do that. And again, we're seeing ourselves at Amazon. So I'll let Andy add some color on kind of the general trends in AWS, but that's more what we're seeing at the customer level right now. Andrew Jassy : So I would just add -- I mean, I think Brian covered a bunch of it. I think most enterprises right now are acting cautiously. You see it with virtually every enterprise, and we're being very thoughtful about streamlining our costs as well. And when you are being cautious, you look for ways that you can find -- you can spend less money. And where companies can cost optimize or, in some cases, they may be used to doing analysis over 90 days of information and they say, \"Well, can I get away with it for 2 weeks, doing 2 weeks' worth,\" it's not necessarily the best thing long term. But a lot of companies will do that when they're in uncertain economic situation.  And the reality is that the way that we've built all our businesses, but AWS in this particular instance, is that we're going to help our customers find a way to spend less money. We are not focused on trying to optimize in any one quarter or any one year, we're trying to build a set of relationships in business that outlast all of us. And so if it's good for our customers to find a way to be more cost effective in an uncertain economy, our team is going to spend a lot of cycles doing that.  And it's one of the advantages that we've talked about since we launched AWS in 2006 of the cloud, which is that when it turns out you have a lot more demand than you anticipated, you can seamlessly scale up. But if it turns out that you don't need as much demand as you had, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it. And that elasticity is very unusual. It's something you can't do on-premises, which is one of the many reasons why the cloud is and AWS are very effective for customers.  I think -- and I've spent a fair bit of time with the AWS team on this, and we look closely at what we see. We have a very robust, healthy customer pipeline, new customers, migrations that are set to happen. A lot of companies during times of discontinuity like this will step back and think about what they want to change strategically to be in a position to reinvent their businesses and change their customer experiences more quickly as uncertain economies emerge, and that often means moving to the cloud. We see a number of those pieces as well. And we're the only ones that really break out our cloud numbers in a more specific way. So it's always a little bit hard to answer your question about what we see. But we, to our best estimations, when we look at the absolute dollar growth year-over-year, we still have significantly more absolute dollar growth than anybody else we see in this space. And I think some of that's a function of the fact that we just have a lot more capability by a large amount, with stronger security and operational performance and a larger partner ecosystem.  So I think it's also useful to remember that 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And if you believe that, that equation is going to shift and flip, I don't think on-premises will ever go away, but I really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud if we continue to have the best customer experience, which we have to work really hard at an event which we're working to do. It means we have a lot of growth in front of us in the AWS business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Ronald Josey : Maybe a bigger high-level question here just around Prime member engagement and just seeing third-party seller services growth accelerating in the quarter. And I believe it was mentioned that customer is spending more on everyday essentials, which may be a relatively new use case. Talk just a little bit more, maybe Andy and Brian, just around how engagement is evolving here for Prime members and really how this has grown wallet share over time and where this is going. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Thanks, Ron, for your question. I would say that the Prime membership is -- remains strong and so has the dollars purchased per Prime member. It varies a bit by geography. But in general, if you step back, we had some very large video properties that we had launched last year, Thursday Night Football and Lord of the Rings : Rings of Power. Both of them had record sign-ups for Prime membership. And we know that, again, investments like that will help with not only a new member or new Prime member acquisition, but also retention. And we see a direct link between that type of engagement and higher purchases of everyday products on our Amazon website.  So the health of Prime is very strong. As Andy mentioned earlier, we are continuing to work to get our speed of delivery up to get more one-day shipments. And we think that will also be well received by Prime members. But it's a combination of price selection and convenience. I think we've made inroads on all of them, especially with the third-party selection that's been added over the last few years. So I think testament to that is the sales that we had in the fourth quarter. In a very competitive and deal-driven environment, people came, Prime members and others came to Amazon to do their shopping. So we're encouraged by it. Andrew Jassy : Just to add really one piece here, which is just, if you step back and think about a lot of subscription programs, there are a number of them that are $14, $15 a month really for entertainment content, which is more than what Prime is today. If you think about the value of Prime, which is less than what I just mentioned, where you get the entertainment content on the Prime Video side and you get the shipping benefit, the fast shipping benefit you can't find elsewhere and you get the music benefit, you get the Prime Gaming benefit and you get the photos benefit and you get the Buy with Prime capability, use your Prime subscription on websites beyond just Amazon and some of the grocery benefits that we provide, and RxPass like we just launched to get a number of medications people take regularly for $5 a month unlimited, that is remarkable value that you just don't find elsewhere. And we will continue to add things to Prime and continue to experiment with lots of different features and benefits. But it's still early days. And as we continue to make the service better and better and fully featured, we see people continuing to spend more at Amazon across our various businesses. So we're optimistic about it. Operator : And our final question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney : Two questions. Brian, just any color on why mid-teens is kind of a holdable growth rate for AWS over the next couple of quarters, given what looks like pretty clearly, continuing deterioration in enterprise demand?  And then, Andy, I wonder at a high level if you could just talk about how your priorities may have changed or the company's priorities may have changed over the last year or so as you've been the CEO. And it looks like there's a bit of a peel back on devices, a peel back on physical stores, except for groceries and then maybe a little bit more of a lean in on health. And I'm not quite sure what you're doing with entertainment content spend like that. Maybe it's the same, maybe it's a little bit more. But just at a high level, how would you say your priorities have changed or are different than the prior CEOs? Brian Olsavsky : So on the AWS growth rate, I'm not sure I can forecast for you with any level of certainty what is going to happen beyond this quarter. You kind of -- this is a bit uncharted territories economically. And as we mentioned, there's some unique things going on with the customer base that I think many in this industry are all seeing the same thing.  So I don't have a crystal ball on that one, but we are going to continue to work for to be there for our customers. And as I said in the earlier comments, we do have new deals. We have new workloads coming to the cloud. The value was there. And whether there's short term, perhaps short-term belt tightening in the infrastructure expense by a lot of companies, I think the long-term trends are still there. And I think the quickest way to save money is to get to the cloud, quite frankly.  So there's a lot of long-term positive in tough economic times. Saw that in 2020 when volumes for customers shifted very quickly. It led to a resurgence after that and probably acceleration of people's journeys to the cloud, and we'll just have to see if that happens again with what we're seeing today. Andrew Jassy : Yes. I would say I think for any leadership team, each era is different, and it's often meaningfully impacted by what's happening around you. And I think that if you look at the last couple of years with things like the pandemic and the labor shortage in 2021 and the war in Ukraine and inflation and uncertain economy, good leadership teams look around and try to figure out what that means and how they should adjust their businesses.  And so if you look at -- in the early part of 2022, I think we realized that as we tried to make sure we met the surge in demand for consumers and sellers and having to make decisions in 2020 for what fulfillment network investments we're going to make in 2022, we just had more capacity than we needed. And you saw us in the early part of 2022 delay some of our builds and mothballed some of our facilities to try and be more economic.  And I think when we look at some of our physical business investments, physical store investments, I think there were just some areas where we didn't have conviction that they were going to be big needle movers for Amazon. And so that's why we closed down our 4-Star bookstores. And as we got into the early part of the summer, where we start our operating planning process, we -- and there was a lot of things happening in the macro economy, we started that process with the high-level tenet of we want to find a way to meaningfully streamline our costs in all of our businesses, not just their existing large businesses, but also in some of the investments we're making. We want to actually do a pretty good, thorough look about what we're investing and how much we think we need to, but doing so without having to give up our ability to invest in the key long-term strategic investments that we think could change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over time. And you saw that process led to us choosing to pause on incremental headcount as we tried to assess what was happening in the economy, and we eliminated some programs in fabric.com and Amazon Care and Amazon Glo and Amazon Explore. We decided to go slower on some -- on the physical store expansion in the grocery space until we had a format that we really believed in rolling out and we went a little bit slower on some devices, and until we made the very hard decision that Brian talked about earlier, which was the hardest decision I think we've all been a part of, which was to reduce or eliminate 18,000 roles. And so those were all done with an eye towards trying to streamline our cost but still be able to invest in the things that we think really matter over the long term.  Now we have a way of looking at investments that is different maybe from some other companies. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. It's just the way we look at it, which is when we think about big areas to invest in, we ask ourselves a few questions. We ask, if we were successful, could it really be big and move the needle at Amazon, which is a high bar at a place like Amazon? Do we think it's being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have some competence in those areas? And if we don't, can we acquire them quickly? And if we like the answers to those questions, we will invest.  Sometimes, that leads to very logical extensions for people. When I got to Amazon 25 years ago, we were a books-only retailer. And when we expanded into music and video and electronics, that seemed pretty natural to people. Amazingly, people were very surprised we were expanding into tools. That seemed far field for people, but it turned out not to be.  When we launch something like Buy with Prime, I think people see that as more predictable. That process has also led us to less predictable investments. And I remember, I had a front-row seat in the AWS experience, having worked with the team and led the team from the very start. And I remember both externally and internally, there were a number of people who wondered why we were doing that. It was so different from retail only. But think about how different a company Amazon would be today if we hadn't invested in AWS.  And so that informs some of the other meaningful investments we're making beyond our stores, in retail and advertising and AWS businesses. I think that while we've gone slower in some devices and things, we still -- when we look at the answers to those 4 questions, we are very enthusiastic about our investments in streaming entertainment devices, our low Earth orbit satellite and Kuiper, health care and a few other things. And I think that do I think every one of our new investments will be successful? History would say that, that would be a long shot. However, it only takes one or two of them becoming the fourth pillar for Amazon for us to be a very different company over time.  So I think it's very worthwhile. We're going to continue to invest. We're going to be very thoughtful about how we streamline our costs, and I think you see a lot of that, but we're also going to continue to invest for the long term. Dave Fildes : Thank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today\u2019s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management\u2019s views as of today, April 27, 2023, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don\u2019t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It\u2019s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining today\u2019s call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I\u2019m joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I\u2019ll make some comments regarding our Q1 results. Let\u2019s begin with revenue. For the first quarter, our worldwide net sales were $127.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year, or 11% excluding approximately 210 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was above the top end of our guidance range. Overall, we are pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in worldwide stores businesses, including quarter-over-quarter revenue acceleration in the International segment, which is helped by easing macroeconomic pressures in Europe. Across the geographies we serve, customers appreciate our focus on staying sharp on pricing, having strong selection and easier convenience, including delivery speeds, which continued to improve throughout the first quarter. That said, the uncertain economic environment and ongoing inflationary pressures continue to be a factor, and we believe it\u2019s continuing to drive cautious spending across consumers. This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further and are focused on value. We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shifts to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty. Third-party sellers, including businesses who elect to utilize Fulfillment by Amazon for their storage and shipping services are a key contributor to the selection offered to customers. We also continued to invest meaningfully in brand protection efforts, including industry-leading technology, so that sellers can trust we will provide a great selling experience free from bad actors. Sellers comprised 59% of overall unit sales in Q1, up from 55% one year ago. We also saw strong engagement in our advertising services with revenue up 23% year-over-year, excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. In particular, our sponsored product and brand offerings remain a key driver of growth as we work with advertisers to help customers make more informed purchase decisions. Our teams remain focused on delivering performance through our comprehensive and flexible measurement capabilities along with insights that allow advertisers the ability to measure the return on their advertising spend and help them grow their business. In AWS, net sales were $21.4 billion in the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year and representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Given the ongoing economic uncertainty, customers of all sizes in all industries continue to look for cost savings across their businesses, similar to what you\u2019ve seen us doing at Amazon. As expected, customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter. And we are seeing these optimizations continue into the second quarter with April revenue growth rates about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1. As a reminder, we\u2019re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We\u2019re working to build customer relationships and a business that will outlast all of us. Therefore, our AWS sales and support teams continue to spend much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so that they can better weather this uncertain economy. This customer orientation is built into our DNA and how we think about our customer relationships and business over the long term. Now, let\u2019s shift to worldwide operating income. For the first quarter, we reported $4.8 billion in operating income, above the top end of our guidance range. This operating income was negatively impacted by an estimated employee severance charge of approximately $470 million in Q1, including $270 million related to AWS. As we finalized our annual planning process and considered the ongoing economic environment, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 9,000 roles, impacting our AWS business as well as Twitch, devices, advertising and our human resources teams. In Q1, our year-over-year growth in stores revenue and unit sales outpaced growth in both our fulfillment expense and our outbound shipping costs. Inflationary pressures continued to ease quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by reductions in linehaul shipping rates as well as lower diesel fuel and electricity costs. We also built on the progress we made throughout 2022 in improving productivity in our fulfillment network through continued process and tech improvements. We exited Q4 with a good balance of labor throughout the network and leveraged that throughout Q1 with customer demand patterns remaining more stable compared to Q1 of last year. As labor availability has stabilized and inventory supply chain challenges have moderated, we\u2019re able to implement some significant structural changes to transition our U.S. fulfillment network to a regionalized model. We believe these improvements put us in a good position to improve both delivery speed and our cost to serve customers over time. We reported overall net income of $3.2 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I\u2019d point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $467 million included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we\u2019ve noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon\u2019s ongoing operations but rather to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian\u2019s stock price. Turning to cash flows. We remain focused on building long-term sustainable growth in free cash flow, including our efforts towards a strong cash flow accretive working capital cycle. Our operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st increased to $54.3 billion, up 38% versus the comparable period year-over-year. Besides the cash benefit of improved profitability year-over-year, we\u2019ve also seen supply chains easing up and made progress to improve our inventory purchasing and payment cycles, which in turn has a positive impact on working capital. Now, let\u2019s turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be lower than our $59 billion investment level in 2022, primarily driven by an expected year-over-year decrease in fulfillment network investments. We\u2019re continuing to invest in infrastructure to support AWS customer needs, including investments to support Large Language Models and generative AI. Before we open the call up for your questions, I\u2019ll hand it over to Andy to share some high-level perspectives on the first quarter. Andy Jassy : Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll share a few thoughts before opening up for questions. From my perspective, I think there\u2019s a fair bit to like about how our teams are delivering for customers and the results we\u2019re starting to see. In our storage business, we\u2019ve been very focused on reducing our cost to serve in our fulfillment network. As we shared in the past, given the unexpected surge in demand during the pandemic, we doubled the size of our fulfillment center footprint and largely built the transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years. This ended up substantially changing the number of nodes and connections in our fulfillment network. And as a result, we spent the last several months not only redesigning dozens of processes to drive better productivity but also re-architecting our placement approach and larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network in the U.S. to a regional one. It means we\u2019ve created 8 interconnected regions in geographic areas with each of these regions having broad relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. We just recently completed this rollout and are quite bullish on the early results. Not surprisingly, shorter travel distances means lower cost to serve and customers getting their orders faster. And while on the topic of delivery speed, we\u2019re really excited about our progress in providing customers more one-day and same-day deliveries and are on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. On the advertising side, we\u2019re continuing to buck wider advertising trends and deliver robust growth. I think there are a few reasons for it. First, even in difficult economies, most people still shop. And with the largest e-commerce shopping venue, we have a lot of customers that companies seek to reach. That, coupled with our very substantial investment in machine learning to make sure customers see relevant ads when they\u2019re looking for various items, have meant that these advertisements have performed unusually well for brands, which makes them want to advertise on Amazon. It\u2019s also worth noting that we\u2019re still very early in our efforts to find a way to thoughtfully place ads in our broader video, live sports, audio and grocery properties. We have a lot of upside still in advertising. In AWS, what we\u2019re seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time. Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can right now. They tell us that most of it is cost optimizing versus cost cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they\u2019re cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences. One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premise\u2019 infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time. And given that it\u2019s best for customers long term, we\u2019ve been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We\u2019ve spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we\u2019re seeing, and I\u2019ve spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we\u2019re seeing in AWS. The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling. And people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it\u2019s going to move to the cloud. And having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best securing operational performance and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. But we\u2019re not close to being done inventing in AWS. Our recent announcement on Large Language Models and generative AI and the chips and managed services associated with them is another recent example. And in my opinion, few folks appreciate how much new cloud business will happen over the next several years from the pending deluge of machine learning that\u2019s coming. This past year has seen us do a fair bit of cost streamlining. As I mentioned in my recent shareholder letter, we took a deep look across the Company and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative\u2019s long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led us to shuttering certain businesses like our physical bookstores, Forestar Stores, Amazon Fabric, Amazon Care and certain devices where we didn\u2019t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that weren\u2019t producing the returns we\u2019d hoped, an example of free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35 and changed them. We also made the very difficult decision to eliminate about 27,000 corporate roles. Like most leadership teams, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate what we\u2019re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively. But while we\u2019ve taken several actions to streamline our costs, we\u2019ve been able to do so while still pursuing the key strategic long-term investments that we believe can meaningfully make customers\u2019 lives better and potentially change what Amazon is. These are investments both in our larger business as mentioned earlier as well as in areas like international expansion in our stores business, large retail market segments in which we\u2019re still nascent like grocery and business-to-business, allowing consumers to use Prime off of Amazon in our Buy with Prime program, entertainment, devices, health care and our Low Earth Orbit satellite for the hundreds of millions of households, companies and government entities that have limited to no connectivity. It\u2019s hard to predict that all of these will be successful but only one or two working would change our business over the long term. We have a lot of work in front of us, but I like the direction we\u2019re headed and strongly believe our best days are in front of us. And with that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : Andy, you talked about the continued optimization. Just curious, can you talk about the degree to which optimization has been done in AWS versus what you think could still lie ahead, and when do you start to lap some of those efforts? And then also on the CapEx side, I think you said overall CapEx would be down in \u201823. Can you just help us understand that a little bit better between retail and AWS? And then what\u2019s required on CapEx from a generative AI and large language model perspective? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : This is Brian. I\u2019ll take the first -- the second part of that question first. On CapEx, we spent $59 million -- $59 billion, excuse me, last year. And we -- on our core fulfillment and transportation areas, we actually are spending less year-over-year, and those estimates are going down. The GAAP or the increases in AWS and infrastructure and we are adding more dollars to the -- for Large Language Models and generative AI. So, we\u2019re creating some space in our fulfillment and transportation number that has been repurposed over to AWS. We still think the combined CapEx will be lower year-over-year. Andy Jassy : Just on your first question, Doug. It\u2019s hard to say exactly where we are in the process. I think that what we continue to see when we talk with customers is that they\u2019re appropriately cautious about what they\u2019re seeing in the economy. They\u2019re trying to find ways to save money as most companies are, including our own. And we have a long track-record, which we continue to pursue, which I think makes sense for customers and for our business long term that we\u2019re not trying to optimize for a quarter or for a year. We\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to help customers be successful over a long period of time because we\u2019re trying to build relationships in a business that outlast to all of us. And so, we\u2019re spending a lot of time with customers trying to help them think of smart ways, not short-term ways, but smart ways to optimize their costs and to be able to scale up and down. And again, one of the big advantages of the cloud is that if you grow quickly, you can seamlessly scale up. But when you don\u2019t have the demand, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it, and that is not true with what you see on-premises. And so we\u2019re trying to work hard to help customers with that. I think it\u2019s important to remember that customers are pretty explicitly telling us that this is not a cost cutting effort where we intend on spending less money on technology or on the cloud. This is our reprioritizing what matters most to our business at this time and trying to reallocate resource so we can build new customer experience [and change what\u2019s possible] (ph). And so, I think if you think about -- those projects, by the way, take time to build. When you\u2019re reallocating, you\u2019re reprioritizing, you\u2019re redefining what you\u2019re going to build, you got to actually go build it before you can implement it. And we\u2019re working pretty carefully and closely with customers on those initiatives. I think it\u2019s important to remember that there\u2019s still so much growth ahead of the cloud, 90-plus percent of the global IT spend is on-premises. And so if you believe that equation is going to flip, it\u2019s mostly moving to the cloud. And I also think that there are a lot of folks that don\u2019t realize the amount of non-consumption right now that\u2019s going to happen and be spent in the cloud with the advent of Large Language Models and generative AI. I think so many customer experiences are going to be reinvented and invented that haven\u2019t existed before. And that\u2019s all going to be spent in my opinion, on the cloud. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Andy, you\u2019ve talked a lot in the letter -- the shareholder letter and on the last earnings call about driving greater levels of efficiencies in the Company and also possibly returning to some of the margin structures we saw pre-pandemic and absorbing overcapacity that built up during the pandemic. Can you give us an update on where you think you are in those broad efforts to match margins versus pre-pandemic levels and strike the right balance between profitability and driving your growth initiatives over the next couple of years? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Eric, this is Brian. Let me start on the financial part of that question. So I think we would describe ourselves as like along on the journey and making solid progress on recovering our cost structure and getting it back to pre-pandemic levels. Andy\u2019s talked about the efforts in operations and the regionalization of our operations. We\u2019ve obviously taken a hard look at all of our businesses that we\u2019re in over the last 6 to 9 months and have made adjustments there. But there\u2019s still a lot ahead of us, especially on the operational side that if you look at our operating margin in North America, for example North America segment, it was 1.2% this quarter, pre-pandemic that number was in the 4% to 6% range broadly. So, it\u2019s a bit of marker on how much upside. But there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in that number. Obviously, there\u2019s the advertising, there\u2019s investments going on for future growth, and there\u2019s the core profitability and cost structure that our operations are achieving. So, making progress, working hard at it, but it\u2019s a longer road than bouncing back in one or two quarters. Andy Jassy : I would just add to that we have looked pretty hard at every single one of our businesses. And I think that while it\u2019s probably most visible given the size of it, what\u2019s the improvement in the operating margin and the efficiency in our stores business, I think every business is working really hard on finding ways to be more efficient. And as Brian said, I think we\u2019re making really, really good progress, the fulfillment costs in our operations network and our stores business. But one of the things that\u2019s been interesting and frankly pretty encouraging to all of us is that as we -- over the last 6 to 9 months, as the network fundamentally changed, remember, when you go through as much growth as we went through and you add -- you double your fulfillment center footprint and you also build a last-mile transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years, there\u2019s a lot that you have to work on to get that as productive as you want. And we\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on that the last 6 to 9 months. But some of the ways that you operated before, which worked through several elbows in the curve and scale, when they become inefficient because the network fundamentally changes, they become inefficient in a significant way. And so it\u2019s part of what led to the regionalization effort that I talked about, but it also caused us to really reevaluate virtually everything we do in operations over the last 6 to 9 months. And we have found a lot more opportunities than we even thought were there before. So, I\u2019m pretty optimistic that we have a chance not just to recover to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of operating margin, but I think there\u2019s additional upside with some of the opportunities we\u2019ve identified. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two, Andy. The first one, you talked a lot about the long-term AI and large language model potential out of AWS. I think there\u2019s a lot of discussion about AWS\u2019s competitive positioning when it comes to these tools. Could you just sort of walk us through 2 or 3 of the key points of differentiation that you think AWS offers and AI tools versus some of the competitors? And then the second one around Echo and Alexa. The neural networks may not be a leading edge of technology now with the rapid emergence of some of these new Large Language Models. How do you think about the key investment priorities for Echo and Alexa going forward? And what\u2019s your view on ROIC around that division? Thanks. Andy Jassy : Yes. I\u2019ll try and answer those together because they\u2019re somewhat related. I think when you think about machine learning, it\u2019s useful to remember that we have had a pretty substantial investment in machine learning for 25-plus years in Amazon. It\u2019s deeply ingrained in virtually everything we do. It fuels our personalized e-commerce recommendations. It drives the Pick Pass in our fulfillment centers. We have it in our Go stores. We have it in our Prime Air, our drones. It\u2019s obviously in Alexa. And then AWS, we have 25-plus machine learning services where we have the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base by a fair bit. And so, it is deeply ingrained in our heritage. I think if you look at what\u2019s happened over the last 9 months or so is that these Large Language Models and generative AI capabilities, they\u2019ve been around for a while, but frankly, the models were not that compelling before about 6, 9 months ago. And they have gotten so much bigger and so much better, much more quickly that it really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists and many that don\u2019t exist that weren\u2019t really that easily made possible before. And so, it\u2019s very early days in that space, but probably not surprisingly, we\u2019ve been investing in building in our own Large Language Models for several years, and we have a very large investment across the Company. And the way I would break it out, Brian, is I would say that there\u2019s three macro areas in this space. If you think about maybe the bottom layer here, is that all of the Large Language Models are going to run on compute. And the key to that compute is going to be the chip that\u2019s in that compute. And to date, I think a lot of the chips there, particularly GPUs, which are optimized for this type of workload, they\u2019re expensive and they\u2019re scarce. It\u2019s hard to find enough capacity. And so, in AWS, we\u2019ve been working for several years on building customized machine learning chips, and we built a chip that\u2019s specialized for training -- machine learning training, which we call Trainium, a chip that\u2019s specialized for inference or the predictions that come from the model called Inferentia. The reality, by the way, is that most people are spending most of their time and money on the training. But as these models graduate to production, where they\u2019re in the apps, all the spend is going to be in inference. So, they both matter a lot. And if you look at -- we just released our second versions of both Trainium and Inferentia. And the combination of price and performance that you can get from those chips is pretty differentiated and very significant. So we think that a lot of that machine learning training, inference will run on AWS. Then if you think about -- so you have to train the models, you have to run the inference, then you got to -- but you have to build the models. And if you look at the really significant leading Large Language Models, they take many years to build and many billions of dollars to build. And there will be a small number of companies that want to invest that time and money, and we\u2019ll be one of them at Amazon, but most companies don\u2019t. And so what most companies really want and what they tell AWS is that they\u2019d like to use one of those foundational models and then have the ability to customize it for their own proprietary data and their own needs and customer experience. And they want to do it in a way where they don\u2019t leak their unique IP to the broader generalized model. And that\u2019s what Bedrock is, which we just announced a week ago or so. It\u2019s a managed foundational model service where people can run foundational models from Amazon, which we\u2019re exposing ourselves, which we call Titan. Or they can run it from leading Large Language Models providers like AI21 and Anthropic and Stability AI. And they can run those models, take the baseline, customize them for their own purposes and then be able to run it with the same security and privacy and all the features they use for the rest of their applications in AWS. That\u2019s very compelling for customers. And then that third layer are really the applications that are going to be built on top of those Large Language Models. So, ChatGPT is a good example of an application that\u2019s being built. We\u2019ll build some of those applications ourselves. So for instance, we think one of the most compelling applications that are going to be built in generative AI have to do with making developers much more effective with coding assistance. And so, we built something called CodeWhisperer, which we just announced the general availability for, where developers can plug in a natural language, something like -- I want to build a video hosting website. And CodeWhisperer will bring up the code you need and the developer needs to employ and put that in production, which is really compelling. If you think about how much more productive a developer is going to be and what they\u2019re going to spend their time on instead of rewriting code that as [Indiscernible] takes time, I think it\u2019s a big deal. Now, to your second question, and it\u2019s related to this top layer I was just talking about, we\u2019re going to build a very -- every single one of our businesses inside Amazon are building on top of Large Language Models to reinvent our customer experiences, and you\u2019ll see it in every single one of our businesses, stores, advertising, devices, entertainment. And devices, which was your specific question, is a good example of that. I think when people often ask us about Alexa, what we often share is that if we were just building a smart speaker, it would be a much smaller investment. But we have a vision, which we have conviction about that we want to build the world\u2019s best personal assistant. And to do that, it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s across a lot of domains and it\u2019s a very broad surface area. However, if you think about the advent of Large Language Models and generative AI, it makes the underlying models that much more effective such that I think it really accelerates the possibility of building that world\u2019s best personal assistant. And I think we start from a pretty good spot with Alexa because we have a couple of hundred million endpoints being used across entertainment and shopping and smart home and information and a lot of involvement from third-party ecosystem partners. And we\u2019ve had a large language model underneath it, but we\u2019re building one that\u2019s much larger and much more generalized and capable. And I think that\u2019s going to really rapidly accelerate our vision of becoming the world\u2019s best personal assistant. I think there\u2019s a significant business model underneath it. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Colin Sebastian : I guess, first off, on the International segment, I mean, not only an acceleration in our top line, but also on the margin side. If you could maybe add a little more color on some of the initiatives and improvements there. And then secondly, on the physical stores, including the grocery strategy, maybe any be worth kind of going through any updated thoughts you have there around the strategy of optimizing stores across categories. And if there are any changes to the footprint plans for those businesses? Thank you. Andy Jassy : Thanks, Colin. I\u2019ll start with the international question. So yes, we saw an acceleration of growth on an FX-neutral basis, 9% versus 5% in Q4. I think the economy there is starting to stabilize and especially in established countries of Europe. We\u2019re seeing consumer confidence has increased and inflation is ticking down. So some of those are similar to North America. But that is what we probably had some upside that we weren\u2019t counting on in international in the first quarter, and that was a good strength. On the margin, the margin has -- the negative margin has come down. Top line is helping there but it\u2019s also a function of some of the reductions that we\u2019re making across some of our investments. Most of those are in North America, but that you\u2019ll see kind of the improvement in operational efficiency and on the edge of some of the global programs are going to be reducing cost in international. I will remind you that, again, that international is an aggregation of established countries which are already profitable and who look a bit like North America, perhaps at an earlier stage of development and working their way to parity on profitability. We have forward-loaded Prime benefits in a lot of these countries that are ahead of the curve that we saw in North America. So happy there. We have a large emerging business. In the last 5 years, we\u2019ve added more than 10 new countries. What we\u2019re seeing is if you looked back to North America long ago, it took 9 years for us to reach breakeven profitability in the United States. We see a similar curve in a lot of countries overseas. There\u2019s, in fact, additional challenges that we usually have to deal with, things like lack of payment methods, lack of the established infrastructure for -- especially for transportation and infrastructure for the internet and everything else. So, the adoption can be slower but we feel good about the businesses we\u2019re building. They carry a lot of the same traits that we have in North America. Price selection and convenience are at the core of that, very happy with the adoption and traffic and new customer acquisition that we\u2019re seeing from Prime Video in a lot of their emerging countries as well. So good quarter. We\u2019ll continue to work again on cost structure and growing those businesses country by country. On the grocery part, what I would say is we continue to progress there. We have an interesting grocery business where we\u2019ve been in it for a while and we have actually quite a large grocery business. It\u2019s just an unusual selection grocery business, very much like how the mass merchandisers got into grocery 25, 30 years ago, where the selection -- are items that are not temperature-controlled, so it\u2019s canned goods and packaged food and paper products and pet supplies and personal care and health and beauty and all sorts of consumables. And interestingly, in this current environment where consumers are being cautious about what they spend and finding ways to trade down in different product variations, consumables have stayed very, very strong. And so, we continue to be very pleased with that -- that part of our grocery business to serve a much broader number of the grocery shopping journeys, which we seek to try to help customers with. We have to have a bigger physical presence since most of the shopping visits are still physical stores. We\u2019ve got two efforts there. We\u2019ve got Whole Foods, which really pioneered the organic grocery space. And that continues to grow nicely, and we\u2019ve made a number of changes in the last year of the business that have changed the profitability trajectory there and feel very good about that. And at the same time, it is still a portion of the overall market segment. And if you really want to serve as much of grocery as we\u2019d like to, you have to have a mass physical offering. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on for a few years with the brand we\u2019ve called Amazon Fresh. We wish we were further along at this point. We\u2019ve tried lots of ideas. We haven\u2019t yet found conviction around the format that we want to go expand much more broadly. We have a set of experiments and ideas and concepts that we\u2019re working on across our dozens of stores there. And we\u2019re pretty optimistic that we have something that may very well work. And we\u2019re hopeful over this next year we find that. But we continue to believe -- it\u2019s a big business for us today. It\u2019s continuing to get bigger, but we believe we have the opportunity for it to be much larger for Amazon and where we can help customers more broadly. And I think having that physical presence, we will also have the ability both to be able to serve the grocery products they come for as well as store some other pieces and help customers across some other product lines as well. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : I guess, AWS, can you call out any unusual items in April or 2Q for the comp? I know you had a very good 2Q last year. And just thinking about linearity in the quarter. And then second, Andy, really appreciate the shareholder letter. It looks like you\u2019ve picked medical and Kuiper as big investment areas. Do you think those -- I mean, why those areas? And does the Company ever think about breaking out all the big investments, so we had more clarity on the retail margin structure? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Hi Justin. Thank you. On AWS, I think Andy did a good job of laying out the dynamics we\u2019re seeing in -- among customers right now and where they\u2019re cutting workloads and continued strength that we see in customers hitting their contractual limits and extending them and planning for the future. So, we feel really strongly about the outlook for the business and understand the short-term work that we\u2019re doing to help customers save money. So, I would say Q2 versus Q1, there\u2019s not an obvious year-over-year comp differential. It\u2019s just, again, understanding which customers are cutting in some areas and growing in others and helping them get on hopefully to the new initiatives that they are planning as well. Andy Jassy : Yes. In terms of the calling out health care and Kuiper in my annual letter, I think what I was trying to do in the letter was explain how we think about investing -- and how we think about our big new investments that we make. And I talked about in the letter that we look at a few things. We look at if -- if it\u2019s successful, could it be big and move the needle for Amazon with the right ROICs? Is that experience being well served today elsewhere? Do we have some kind of differentiation? And do we have some confidence that the Company in that area? If not, can we acquire it quickly? And we\u2019d like the answers to those questions, we will invest. Some of those investments lead to what seem like relatively straightforward investments. And I talked a little bit about category expansion and international expansion in our stores business and some of the nascent retail market segments that are large for us that we think we can have big businesses in and business to business, our Amazon business entity and grocery and things like Buy with Prime, which allow our consumers to use their Prime Benefit and other third-party websites beyond Amazon and also let merchants convert at a higher rate because Prime members are able to pay quickly and then get that fast, reliable shipping they get from Prime. But then there are other investments I was pointing out that sometimes don\u2019t lead to categories that people might initially guess. And AWS was a good example of that where that seemed really different for us when we started to pursue that in 2003. And we\u2019re a pretty different company because we did so, even though there were a lot of people externally and internally that thought was a little bit crazy. And so I just chose two of them there. I could have chosen a lot more. The letter was long enough as it was, so I just chose two but I chose two that we have conviction about. On the health care side, when you think about that set of questions that we ask ourselves when we consider whether we should make big investments, health care is a multitrillion dollar business that\u2019s very segmented, and it\u2019s really broken in the U.S. particularly, I think in other parts of the world, too, but particularly in the U.S. And we had what we thought were some differentiated ways that we could be successful at. And I think when -- our customers have been asking us for years to provide a pharmacy. And if you think about that, it\u2019s not -- that\u2019s a pretty natural extension from what we do in retail, and we\u2019ve launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 and I think it\u2019s off to a good start. It\u2019s continuing to grow. We have a lot to do there. But a lot of our customers who like that experience said, \"Gosh, I wish you guys would help us in the broader health care experience.\" And if you think about trying to meaningfully change that experience, primary care is right at the center of it. And if you look at the experience that\u2019s been the case for the last several decades, we\u2019re going to have a hard time convincing our grandkids that it used to be the case to get a primary care appointment, you had to call ahead of time, a month ahead to schedule an appointment and drive 20 minutes to the doctor and park and get into the facility and wait 20 minutes in reception. And you get into an exam room, you wait 10 minutes for the doctor to come in. The doctor talks to you for 5 minutes and then prescribes you medicine where you drive 20 minutes to go get the medicine. And that experience just doesn\u2019t make sense and won\u2019t be the case. And so, we looked at -- we had some experience when we started experimenting with Amazon Care, and we couldn\u2019t believe how much people liked the streamlined experience. And we ultimately decided we didn\u2019t have the right business model there. But we came across one medical where the digital app is very compelling and you can talk to a medical practitioner by chat or by video conference, or if you have to come into a physical facility, they have clinics around the country and you can get that appointment same day or next day. In all those cities, they have relationships with health specialists, where you\u2019re plugged into. Their ability to get reservations where you can get reservations in a day or two there. And then when you need medicine, you can have it automatically shipped to you by Amazon Pharmacy or other third-party pharmacies. It\u2019s a very, very different experience. And we think we have an opportunity to be successful in helping change that experience. And if we\u2019re successful with primary care and with health -- and with pharmacy, there are a lot of other things we can help customers with as well. So, we think that\u2019s a big opportunity. And then I\u2019ll just briefly say on Kuiper that it\u2019s a very large number. It\u2019s hundreds of millions of households and businesses and government entities that today have limited to no connectivity to the internet. And if you just think about what you can\u2019t do if you don\u2019t have connectivity, we all take it for granted. But having that connectivity means you can take online education courses and get an education, or you can start or run a business or you can enjoy entertainment or you can shop for anything you can imagine. And for businesses and governments, to be able to have that coverage to be able to operate much more seamlessly in the various environments in which you have to have a presence, it\u2019s a total game changer. And so, we think it has the chance to be a very large business. We haven\u2019t -- we\u2019ve released some information about it in some of our designs. And it\u2019s pretty exciting to us how many customers in all those different segments are excited about it. And so, I just chose those two as exemplary of some of the inventions that come out of that investment process that you might not guess but that we think can be very significant for the Company. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months.

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, August 3, 2023 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Jassy : Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we are reporting $134.4 billion in revenue and $7.7 billion in operating income, both of which exceeded the top end of our guidance ranges. We're encouraged by the progress we're making on several key priorities, namely: lowering our cost to serve in our stores business; continuing to innovate on and improve our various customer experiences; and building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers in our business long term. I'll start with our ongoing effort to lower our cost to serve in our stores' fulfillment network. Q2 saw another meaningful improvement in this area as we have steadily made progress for the last several quarters. Central to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores' fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for our delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers and more than 1,000 basis point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed, while driving its costs higher and where it doesn't matter much to customers. This argument is incorrect.  There are two things to note. First, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It's also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, gets there faster and is better for the environment. There's a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic and local in-stock algorithms. It's also driven by our development and expansion of same-day fulfillment facilities, which is our fastest fulfillment mechanism and one of our least expensive, too. Our same-day facilities are located in the largest metro areas around the U.S., so our top-moving 100,000 SKUs, but also cover millions of other SKUs from nearby fulfillment centers that inject selection into these same-day facilities and have a design that streamlines getting items from order to being ready for delivery in as little as 11 minutes. The experience has been so positive for customers in our business that we're planning to double the number of these facilities. We believe that we are far from the law of diminishing returns and improving speed for customers. While we're seeing strong early results from this regionalization effort, we still see several ways in which we can be more efficient in this structure and we believe will improve productivity further. We've also reevaluated virtually every part of our fulfillment network this past year and see additional structural changes we can make that provide future upside. We're excited about this cost to serve improvement, but also remain maniacally focused on making customers' lives easier and better every day and relentlessly inventing to make it so. This means constantly trying to improve experiences that we can deliver to customers short and long term. This customer experience work is at the heart of what we do every day across every one of our businesses. And I can spend an hour on this call detailing various examples across the teams. For today, I'll just focus a bit on our stores and AWS businesses. For stores, our priorities continue to be providing customers with great selection, low prices and convenience. And as we've discussed, we've been especially focused on providing even faster delivery speeds. Our speed of delivery has never been faster. In this last quarter, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime members' orders arrived at the same day or next day. So far this year, we've delivered more than 1.8 billion units to U.S. Prime members the same or next day, nearly 4x what we delivered at those speeds by this point in 2019. Lowering our cost to serve allows us not only to invest in these speed improvements, but also add more selection at lower price points. In particular, we're growing our selection in everyday essentials, enabling customers to avoid going out to get these items and both increasing our basket sizes and the frequency with which customers choose to shop with us. We now have more than 300 million items available with U.S. Prime free shipping, including tens of millions of items with free same-day and 1-day delivery. We're continuing to focus on providing great value with tens of millions of deals that help customers stretch their dollar a little more. For instance, in Q2 of '23, we offered customers 144% more deals and coupons than we did in Q2 of 2022. Prime Day was similar. Amazon offered more deals than any past Prime Day event with a wide selection across millions of products. Prime members purchased more than 375 million items worldwide and saved more than $2.5 billion across the Amazon store, helping make it the biggest Prime Day ever. Next, a few words about AWS. AWS remains the clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position with respect to number of customers, size of partner ecosystem, breadth of functionality and the strongest operational performance. These are important factors for why AWS has grown the way it has over the last several years and for why AWS has almost doubled the revenue of any other provider. I've talked to many AWS customers over the years and continue to do so. And while all these factors I mentioned have been big drivers of the business' success, AWS customers tell us that as importantly, they care about the very different customer focus and orientation in AWS may see elsewhere. As the economy has been uncertain over the last year, AWS customers have needed assistance cost optimizing to withstand this challenging time and reallocate spend to newer initiatives that better drive growth. We've proactively helped customers do this. And while customers have continued to optimize during the second quarter, we've started seeing more customers shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. As a result, we've seen AWS' revenue growth rate stabilize during Q2 where we reported 12% year-over-year growth. The AWS team continues to innovate and change what's possible for customers at a rapid clip. You can see across the array of AWS product categories where AWS leads in compute, networking, storage, database, data solutions and machine learning, among other areas, and the continued invention and delivery in these areas is pretty unusual. For instance, a few years ago, we heard consistently from customers that they wanted to find more price performance ways to do generalized compute. And to enable that, we realized that we needed to rethink things all the way down to the silicon and set out to design our own general purpose CPU chips. Today, more than 50,000 customers use AWS' Graviton chips and AWS Compute instances, including 98 of our top 100 Amazon EC2 customers, and these chips have about 40% better price performance than other leading x86 processors. The same sort of reimagining is happening in generative AI right now. Generative AI has captured people's imagination, but most people are talking about the application layer, specifically what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT. It's important to remember that we're in the very early days of the adoption and success of generative AI, and that consumer applications is only one layer of the opportunity. We think of large language models in generative AI as having 3 key layers, all of which are very large in our opinion and all of which AWS is investing heavily in. At the lowest layer is the compute required to train foundational models and do inference or make predictions. Customers are excited by Amazon EC2 P5 instances powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs to train large models and develop generative AI applications. However, to date, there's only been one viable option in the market for everybody and supply has been scarce. That, along with the chip expertise we've built over the last several years, prompted us to start working several years ago on our own custom AI chips for training called Trainium and inference called Inferentia that are on their second versions already and are a very appealing price performance option for customers building and running large language models. We're optimistic that a lot of large language model training and inference will be run on AWS' Trainium and Inferentia chips in the future. We think of the middle layer as being large language models as a service. Stepping back for a second, to develop these large language models, it takes billions of dollars and multiple years to develop. Most companies tell us that they don't want to consume that resource building themselves. Rather, they want access to those large language models, want to customize them with their own data without leaking their proprietary data into the general model, have all the security, privacy and platform features in AWS work with this new enhanced model and then have it all wrapped in a managed service. This is what our service Bedrock does and offers customers all of these aforementioned capabilities with not just one large language model but with access to models from multiple leading large language model companies like Anthropic, Stability AI, AI21 Labs, Cohere and Amazon's own developed large language models called Titan. Customers, including Bridgewater Associates, Coda, Lonely Planet, Omnicom, 3M, Ryanair, Showpad and Travelers are using Amazon Bedrock to create generative AI application. And we just recently announced new capabilities from Bedrock, including new models from Cohere, Anthropic's Claude 2 and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 as well as agents for Amazon Bedrock that allow customers to create conversational agents to deliver personalized up-to-date answers based on their proprietary data and to execute actions. If you think about these first 2 layers I've talked about, what we're doing is democratizing access to generative AI, lowering the cost of training and running models, enabling access to large language model of choice instead of there only being one option, making it simpler for companies of all sizes and technical acumen to customize their own large language model and build generative AI applications in a secure and enterprise-grade fashion, these are all part of making generative AI accessible to everybody and very much what AWS has been doing for technology infrastructure over the last 17 years. Then that top layer is where a lot of the publicity and attention have focused, and these are the actual applications that run on top of these large language models. As I mentioned, ChatGPT is an example. We believe one of the early compelling generative AI applications is a coding companion. It's why we built Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI-powered coding companion, which recommends code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating developer productivity as they code. It's off to a very strong start and changes the game with respect to developer productivity. Inside Amazon, every one of our teams is working on building generative AI applications that reinvent and enhance their customers' experience. But while we will build a number of these applications ourselves, most will be built by other companies, and we're optimistic that the largest number of these will be built on AWS. Remember, the core of AI is data. People want to bring generative AI models to the data, not the other way around. AWS not only has the broadest array of storage, database, analytics and data management services for customers, it also has more customers and data store than anybody else. Coupled with providing customers with unmatched choices at these 3 layers of the generative AI stack as well as Bedrock's enterprise-grade security that's required for enterprises to feel comfortable putting generative AI applications into production, we think AWS is poised to be customers' long-term partner of choice in generative AI. We're also continuing to make meaningful progress in building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers in our business long term. Amazon Business is one of our fastest-growing offerings with a $35 billion annual gross sales run rate. And the team is working hard to further build out the selection, value, convenience and features that business customers need. Buy with Prime is continuing to show a lot of progress. Merchants in early trials who use Buy with Prime saw their shopper conversion increased by 25% on average, which makes a real difference to their business. Also, merchants who participate in Prime Day activities, in aggregate, experienced a 10x increase in daily Buy with Prime orders during the sales event period versus the month before we announced Prime Day. It's frankly only been a short amount of time that we've decided to invest significantly in the health care market segment. A lot of what we tried before were smaller experiments. But we're pleased with Amazon Pharmacy doubling its active customers in the past year, and we're pleased with the response to RxPass, which enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible generic medications for just $5 a month and have them delivered free to their door. One Medical has been part of Amazon for just a few months now and we're encouraged by what we're seeing there, too. Our grocery business continues to grow. We already have a very large business in nontemperature-controlled areas like consumables, pet food, beauty and canned goods that continues to grow as we keep increasing speed and lowering our cost to serve, which allows us to sell more items more cost effectively. Whole Foods continues to lead the organic grocery space, is growing at a healthy clip and has meaningfully improved its profitability in the last year. We're pleased with what we're seeing with Whole Foods. And as I've shared before, we're working on new formats in our mass physical store offering, Amazon Fresh, having significantly improved the number of the key business inputs and just rolled out new concepts in stores. We also see substantial innovation and progress in other areas like Kuiper, Zoox and Alexa. We're still relatively early in many of our investments with technology inventions that are changing what's possible to deliver for customers in these areas, but they're big long-term opportunities that we remain optimistic about. Finally, I want to recognize our teams on being named 1 in LinkedIn's Top Companies to Grow your Career in the United States. It's a testament to our work to be a great employer with leading compensation benefits and upskilling opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we saw worldwide revenue of $134.4 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range. We are encouraged by the strength in our reported revenue, which is another proof point that our focus on price, selection and convenience continues to resonate with customers. We continue to see healthy demand across everyday essentials and in categories like beauty and health and personal care and have seen a positive customer response to improvements in personalization and enhancements to our website and mobile app. During the quarter, we also saw improvements in macroeconomic indicators across our North America and international segments, but continue to see customers trading down and seeking value in their purchases. Delivery speed has been a key area of focus over the last several quarters, and we reached record levels during Q2. Prime members love the faster ship speeds and are shopping more often. Advertising revenue remained strong, up 22% year-over-year. Our performance-based advertising offerings continue to be the largest contributor to our growth. Our teams worked to increase the relevancy of the ads we show to our customers by leveraging machine learning and improve our ability to measure the return on advertising spend for brands. Third-party unit mix increased to 60% during the quarter, the highest level we've ever seen, and we're continuing to see good growth in the number of sellers and the unit sold per seller. We're making steady progress on improving our worldwide stores profitability. Since North America segment operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have seen 5 consecutive quarters of improvement, with second quarter operating margin of 3.9%. This is an improvement of 620 basis points over these past 5 quarters. One of the largest drivers of this operating income improvement in the stores business has been reducing our cost to serve, with shipping costs and fulfillment costs continuing to grow at a slower pace than our unit growth. Most recently, regionalization is an important contributor. Faster delivery speed from better network connectivity and better inventory placement means less miles traveled and fewer touches, resulting in less cost. And while we are pleased with the progress we have made, we see more opportunity to drive improved cost efficiencies going forward. Moving to the international segment. Since our operating margin loss bottomed out in Q3 of last year, we have seen 3 consecutive quarters of improvement, with a second quarter margin loss of negative 3%. This is an improvement of 590 basis points over the last 3 quarters. This segment also includes our emerging countries. It is important to remember how early we are in some of these marketplaces. We've launched more than 10 countries in the past 6 years and are always evaluating our customer experience as well as our path to profitability, and we like the path we're on. As a reminder, it took us 9 years to reach profitability in the United States. In addition, across our North America and international results, inflation headwinds also continue to ease, most notably in fuel prices, linehaul rates, ocean and rail rates. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth was 12%, with growth rates stabilizing during Q2. We are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline and believe having a large diverse customer base that is mostly cost optimized sets us up well for future growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was positive and improved for the fourth sequential quarter. Our financial focus remains on driving long-term sustainable free cash flows. The largest driver of the recent improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, most notably in the North America and international segments where, as I said, we've made meaningful improvement in our fulfillment network productivity and operating leverage and benefited from moderating inflationary pressures. We've also seen improvements in our working capital contributions to free cash flow. Over the past couple of years, working capital hasn't been as efficient as we've held higher weeks of cover of inventory in the face of supply chain disruptions. Most recently, as these disruptions continue to ease, we are improving our inventory efficiency, resulting in improvements in our working capital. We will remain focused on continued free cash flow improvement moving forward. Next, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of capital expenditures plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $54 billion for the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, down from $61 billion in the comparable prior year period. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be slightly more than $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation CapEx to be down year-over-year, partially offset by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts.  With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Colin Sebastian : I guess first on the fulfillment efficiency. Would be curious if you could give us a sense for how much of that optimization in the network with unit economics may have already been achieved in these numbers versus how much more you think is left to go. And related to that, I'm curious if you can leverage this reformulated network to help out with the grocery expansion. Or will that be limited to the stores and the specialized automated facilities you're building out? Brian Olsavsky : I'll take that first one. So on fulfillment efficiency, we're encouraged again by what we're seeing with regionalization and also the efforts to control our cost structure and the -- some of the inflationary pressures coming down. We're still in that journey, though, to reclaim the cost structure that we had previously and we consider this as a point along the road. So encouraged by some of the margin improvements we're seeing, particularly over the last 3 to 5 quarters but we're still underway. There's still a lot to be regained in our fulfillment area, and the teams are working very hard on it. On the question of grocery, as Andy explained at different points, our grocery business has a lot of dimensions to it. Obviously, there's consumables, there's fresh goods, there's Whole Foods. The same -- sub-same-day is probably mostly impacting the first -- that pocket of the consumables and everyday essentials. And as Andy mentioned, we're able to expand our selection in those areas because our cost structure can, quite frankly, afford it when the distances of customers are shorter and the transportation costs are more fixed. Andrew Jassy : I'll just add to that, this is Andy, that I do think there's some optimization and some leverage we get from our fulfillment network. And particularly in the case of being able to inject a number of items into our same-day facilities, to increase the number of items that people can add at the last minute, even grocery items that they can get same day. And I think that you see some of that already and you'll see more of that moving forward. And I also think that you'll see over time that we're going to be able to leverage being able to have -- people be able to pick up different items from different grocery-like options that are different grocery formats. But it's also true that we have infrastructure build-out in our grocery business that's different and optimized for the grocery business, too. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney : I'll limit myself to one question for each of you. Amazon Business has been a couple of years since you've talked about that. It would seem like there'd be a lot more opportunities, frankly, a lot higher level of sales, bookings, whatever, that you get out of that. So Andy, just talk about like how big of a priority is that for you? And what's the growth strategy? Like how do you take that to $100 billion? And then on the -- Brian, on AWS, in the last 2 quarters, you provided a little bit of a look ahead into the quarter in terms of the AWS growth, given some of the commentary about moving beyond optimization and into new workloads without -- if you don't give a specific number, at least talk about the trends that you're seeing versus what you had in the second quarter. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, sure. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with that second question. So again, if we rewind to our last conference call, we had seen 16% AWS revenue growth in Q1, and the growth rates have been dropping during the quarter. And what I mentioned was that April was running about 500 basis points lower than Q1. What we've seen in the quarter is stabilization and you see the final 12% growth. I will stop for a moment and just put that in perspective. So again, last Q2 last year, we had close to $20 billion of revenue and we grew that $2.4 billion. So that's -- while that is 12%, there's a lot of cost optimization dollars that came out and a lot of new workloads and new customers that went in. So there was -- on our base, it's very large numbers. And when customers start to -- that cost optimization work, they can take some of their spend down for a while as they do that, and we help them do that and been part of our DNA ever since we started AWS. So that's all good. What we're seeing in the quarter is that those cost optimizations, while still going on, are moderating and many maybe behind us in some of our large customers. And now we're seeing more progression into new workloads, new business. So those balanced out in Q2. We're not going to give segment guidance for Q3. But what I would add is that we saw Q2 trends continue into July. So generally feel the business has stabilized, and we're looking forward to the back end of the year in the future because, as Andy said, there's a lot of new functionality coming out with -- and there's a lot of spend that will be in this area for all the great solutions that are out there for generative AI and large language models as well as machine learning solutions that we've always had for customers. So optimistic and starting to see some good traction with our customers' new volumes. Andrew Jassy : Yes. I'll just underline one point Brian made and then quickly get to the Amazon Business point. Just if you think about the AWS business being an $88 billion revenue run rate business, to grow double digits on a business that size with the amount of cost optimizing that's been happening, to grow double digits, you have to be adding a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads just to grow double digits. So when I talked about last quarter how I liked a lot of the fundamentals that we were seeing in the business with respect to customer pipeline, the new workloads, the migrations happening, what the team is rolling out functionality-wise, that's kind of what I'm talking about. And as we start to see cost optimization attenuate and more of the workloads, new workloads that people took those cost optimizations and actually started to plan come to fruition, not to mention what's coming with generative AI, there's a lot of growth in front of us on AWS. Just on your Amazon Business question, Mark, $35 billion annual run rate for gross sales is pretty strong growth. And if you look at it year-over-year, it continues to be very strong. But I like the way you're thinking, Mark, and it's almost like you're in some of the meetings that we're in where I asked the very same question. The team is working hard to build $100 billion-plus business over time. And I think that the business has grown to be pretty large already, and I still think we only have a fraction of the features that we need to address more of the enterprise at this point. There's all sorts of companies ordering obviously from Amazon Business. But the bigger procurement workloads, there are certain features that you need to make them much easier in the way that companies are used to buying in those big procurements. And so we have a lot of features that we're adding. We have a number of service pieces that we need to add really around helping on big buys, do some of the service substantiations. And so we have a lot of functionality that we're very quickly adding to the mix here. But I don't think we're close to being done growing there, and that is a very strong area of focus for our stores team and for our senior leadership team as well. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Andy, just on AI monetization. Can you just talk to when you think you'll start to see that flow into the AWS business? Is that 2024? Do you feel like the back half, you'll start to see that as a bigger impact for the business? Andrew Jassy : Yes. Good question, Brent. What I would say is that we have had a very significant amount of business in AWS driven by machine learning and AI for several years. And you've seen that largely in the form of compute as customers have been doing a lot of machine learning training and then running their models and production on top of AWS and our compute instances. But you've also seen it in the form of the 20-plus machine learning services that we've had out there for a few years. I think when you're talking about the big potential explosion in generative AI, which everybody is excited about, including us, I think we're in the very early stages there. We're a few steps into a marathon in my opinion. I think it's going to be transformative, and I think it's going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know. But I think it's really early. I think most companies are still figuring out how they want to approach it. They're figuring how to train models. They want to -- they don't want to build their own very large language models. They want to take other models and customize it, and services like Bedrock enable them to do so. But it's very early. And so I expect that will be very large, but it will be in the future. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for all the detail in the prepared remarks around framing some of those key issues. Andy, maybe coming back to grocery. There's been a lot of coverage in the press around your grocery initiative in the last couple of days. When you take a step back, how much do you think about solving the grocery dynamic in the business to capitalize on it the way you want? Is it an element of things you need to build and the application of capital versus elements of executing on what's already in place and sort of aligning the assets in place against the scale of the Amazon Prime household in your customer base? Andrew Jassy : Yes, it's a good question. It's a little bit of both. I mean if I just step back and think about how we think about grocery, we continue to have this very big business in nonperishables, which is where a lot of the mass merchandisers started in grocery several years ago. So these are areas like consumables and canned goods and pet food and beauty and health. And as I said, it's a big business that's continuing to grow. But if you want to be able to serve more customers, which we do, and there are a whole number of reasons for that and customers want it, you have to have a strong physical presence. We started with Whole Foods, which is the pioneer in organic grocery, it continues to be, and we really like the way Whole Foods is growing. We've made a number of really important adjustments in the business, has changed its profitability trajectory over the last year. And we really like where that's headed and we're expanding that meaningfully. But if you want to be really broad, you have to have a mass physical format. We have been working on that for several years with Amazon Fresh. And I would say that we weren't pleased with the inputs, the progress on the inputs there. And the team has worked very hard over the last year to first start on the quality of the input, and that goes towards the quality of what we already had in place. And these are things like the right in-stock levels, the right cost structure, the right figures on things like obsolescence, just a number of the core inputs there, we just felt like we could be sharper and better. And I think that team has made up a lot of improvements. We have spent a lot of time thinking and rethinking how we want the formats to look. And we've just started rolling out some of those new formats, starting in our Chicago stores and then moving to our Southern California stores shortly thereafter. And you see added selection. You see added private brands. You see added well-known third-party brands like Krispy Kreme in coffee in the stores. You've seen a refined decor in the stores. You see refined dash cards that keep a running tally for people so they understand where they are at the moment wherever they're shopping, as well as refined self-service checkouts. And all those things, to me, are part of an effort we're trying to pursue to have a format in our mass Amazon Fresh stores that resonate more with customers. And we're hopeful that we will find that format and that it gives us the type of results that give us confidence to want to expand more broadly. But we won't expand unless we see that type of resonance. We're not just going to be on discipline. We're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about it. I do think also, you're starting to see across the team pulling some of the efforts together. So we have a number of different grocery offerings that I just talked about, just having a converged shopping cart for customers, which they have obviously wanted that I think will help them quite a bit. We're continuing to extend delivery to non-Prime customers as well. And so I think there are a number of opportunities for us over time to grow the business. We're optimistic that we'll be able to do so, but we're also being disciplined about not expanding the physical fresh stores until we have a format that we think is more resonant with customers. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one, Andy, on the last call last quarter, you talked about how you sort of talked about North America retail margins potentially getting to at or above pre-COVID levels. I think you said a margin around 4% and you're sort of talking now about investing more in grocery and expanding same-day and expanding that footprint. How should we think about sort of the forward slope of North America retail margins and sort of invest in some of these new initiatives in the retail business? Then the second one on AI. How high of an investment priority is it for you to improve your own retail and device network through more AI investments, potentially through logistics or AI-based agents, et cetera? How large is that in the overall investment priority list? Andrew Jassy : Well, I'll start on the North America retail piece, which is again, I'll just remind that we're not going to expand the number of fresh stores in a very significant way until we believe we have something that is resonant with customers and that we're going to like the return on invested capital. So that to me, I'm hopeful we're going to find that but we won't until we do. I think as it relates to same-day facilities, we actually think that's going to be very positive for the business. It is -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, it is one of our most cost-effective mechanisms and fulfillment vehicles with respect not just to getting it there to customers quickly, but being fast, in part because those facilities, they're smaller facilities. They're big enough obviously to hold, in steady state, 100,000 SKUs and then also to have all of our nearby fulfillment centers be able to inject lots of different selection in there, so we can cover several million SKUs in that same-day or 1-day fashion. But they're smaller -- in general, they're smaller facilities with less conveyance and with more streamlined pick directly to pack and to get out to the dock to ship. And so they're just much more efficient as well. So we actually think that the expansion of those is going to not just help with speed and with demand, but we're going to also like the cost structure associated with that. And I continue to believe what I said last quarter, Brian, which is I do believe that we'll get back to margins like what we had pre COVID. And I don't think that's the end of what's possible for us there. On the AI question, what I would tell you, every single one of our businesses inside of Amazon, every single one has multiple generative AI initiatives going right now. And they range from things that help us be more cost effective and streamlined in how we run operations in various businesses to the absolute heart of every customer experience in which we offer. And so it's true in our stores business. It's true in our AWS business. It's true in our advertising business. It's true in all our devices, and you can just imagine what we're working on with respect to Alexa there. It's true in our entertainment businesses, every single one. It is going to be at the heart of what we do. It's a significant investment and focus for us. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Just on AWS, as you lap optimizations and the macro-driven slowdown and you start to get the new workload deployment, how do you think about what normalized growth could look like for AWS in a better macro environment? And then secondly, helpful to get the just over $50 billion CapEx number for this year. Just curious how generative AI changes or could change your CapEx trajectory going forward. Andrew Jassy : Well, it's a good question. And I would say that while I expect there will continue to be cost optimization, I think that the balance of cost optimizations to actually new workloads and new migrations as we saw a shift in that in Q2, I expect that we'll continue to see that shift over time. And as I said, I mean, everybody has to make their own conclusions on what percentage revenue growth they believe it means. But to grow double digits on an $88 billion revenue run rate business, when you're seeing that amount of cost optimization as every company in the world is trying to save as much money as they can in the last year, to still grow double digits on a base that size means that we're acquiring a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads. And so I'm very bullish on the growth of AWS over the next several years. And any one quarter, it's hard for me to predict, but I am bullish about it in the medium to long term for sure. I think that on the -- how much generative AI may impact the capital expense spend, included in that number is a pretty significant amount of capital expense in the AWS business for large language models and for generative AI. And we have quite a bit of demand right now. And so it's -- like in AWS, in general, one of the interesting things in AWS, and this has been true from the very earliest days, which is the more demand that you have, the more capital you need to spend because you invest in data centers and hardware upfront and then you monetize that over a long period of time. So I would like to have the challenge of having to spend a lot more in capital in generative AI because it will mean that customers are having success and they're having success on top of our services and -- but I think that, that's our best estimate right now on that capital expense, and we'll update it if we find it's different. Dave Fildes : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello and welcome to our Q3 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2023, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Jassy : Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.1 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year; $11.2 billion in operating income, up 343% year-over-year or $8.7 billion; and $20.2 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases which is up $41.7 billion versus the comparable period last year. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we're making in lowering our cost to serve, improving our customer experiences and investing for future growth. I'll start with our stores business. Our move earlier this year from a single national fulfillment network in the U.S. to 8 distinct regions represented one of the most significant changes to our fulfillment network in our history. This change has gone more smoothly and made more impact than we optimistically expected. And you can see the benefits in many forms. Regional fulfillment clusters with higher local in-stock levels and optimized connections between fulfillment centers and delivery stations mean shorter distances and fewer touches to get items to customers. Shorter travel distances and fewer touches mean lower cost to serve. But perhaps most importantly, shorter distances and fewer touches mean that customers are getting their shipments faster. We remain on pace to deliver the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in our 29-year history. And as I talked about last quarter, we know how important speed of delivery is to customer satisfaction and buying behavior. A good example is the significant growth we're seeing in consumables and everyday essentials. When customers are getting items as quickly and conveniently as they are now from Amazon, they're going to consider us more frequently for more of their shopping needs. As we've shared the last few quarters, we've re-evaluated every part of our fulfillment network over the last year. The first substantial rearchitecture centered on the regionalization change. We obviously like the results but don't think we fully realize all the benefits yet and we continue to make steady improvements in fine-tuning the placement algorithms to enable even more in-region fulfillment and to further increase consolidation into fewer shipments. We've also identified several substantial changes to our inbound processes that we believe could have a significant impact on our cost to serve and speed of delivery. We have a long way before being out of ideas to improve cost and speed. The team is really humming on this and I'm proud of the way they're inventing and executing together. Moving to AWS and our investments in generative AI. AWS revenue grew 12% year-over-year in Q3, with $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue and now has the annualized revenue run rate of $92 billion. AWS' year-over-year growth rate continued to stabilize in Q3. And while we still saw elevated cost optimization relative to a year ago, it's continued to attenuate as more companies transition to deploying net new workloads. Companies have moved more slowly in an uncertain economy in 2023 to complete deals. But we're seeing the pace and volume of closed deals pick up and we're encouraged by the strong last couple of months of new deals signed. For perspective, we signed several new deals in September with an effective date in October that won't show up in any GAAP reported number for Q3 but the collection of which is higher than our total reported deal volume for all of Q3. Deal signings are always lumpy and the revenue happens over several years but we like the recent deal momentum we're seeing. Top of mind for most companies continues to be generative AI. As I mentioned last quarter, we think about generative AI as having 3 macro layers, each of which is very large in each of which we're investing. A few updates there. At the lowest layer is the compute to train large language models, or LLMs and produce inferences or predictions. The key to this compute is the chip inside it. As we've shared, we've been working on custom silicon for training and inference with our Trainium and Inferentia chips, respectively. Recently, we announced that leading LLM maker Anthropic chose AWS as its primary cloud provider and will use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train and deploy its future LLMs. As part of this partnership, AWS and Anthropic will collaborate on the future development of Trainium and Inferentia technology. We believe this collaboration will be helpful in continuing to accelerate the price performance advantages that Trainium and Inferentia deliver for customers. In the middle layer which we think of as large language models as a service, we recently introduced general availability for Amazon Bedrock which offers customers access to leading LLMs from third-party providers like Anthropic, Stability AI, coherent AI 21 as well as from Amazon's own LLMs called Titan, where customers can take those models, customize them using their own data but without leaking that data back into the generalized LLM, have access to the same security, access control and features that they run the rest of their applications within AWS all through a managed service. In the last couple of months, we've announced the imminent addition of Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock, the first time it's being made available through a fully managed service. Also through our expanded collaboration with Anthropic, customers will gain access to future Anthropic models through Bedrock with exclusive early access to unique features, model customization and the ability to fine-tune the models. And Bedrock has added several new compelling features, including the ability to create agents which can be programmed to accomplish tasks like answering questions or automating workflows. In these early days of generative AI, companies are still learning which models they want to use which models they use for what purposes and which model sizes they should use to get the latency and cost characteristics they desire. In our opinion, the only certainty is that there will continue to be a high rate of change. Bedrock helps customers with this fluidity, allowing them to rapidly experiment with move between model types and sizes and enabling them to pick the right tool for the right job. The customer reaction to Bedrock has been very positive and the general availability is buoyed that further. Bedrock is the easiest way to build and scale enterprise-ready generative AI applications and a real game changer for developers and companies trying to get value out of this new technology. And the top layer which are the applications that run the LLMs, our generative AI coding companion Amazon CodeWhisperer has gotten a lot of early traction and got a lot more powerful recently with the launch of its new customization capability. The number one enterprise request for coding companions has been wanting these companions to be familiar with customers' proprietary code bases. It's not just having code companions trained in open source code, companies want the equivalent of a long-time senior engineer who knows their code base well. That's what CodeWhisperer just launched, another first of its kind out there in its current form and customers are excited about it. A few last comments on AWS's generative AI work. As you can tell, we're focused on doing what we've always done for customers, taking technology that can transform customer experiences and businesses but they can be complex and expensive and democratizing it for customers of all sizes and technical abilities. It's also worth remembering that customers want to bring the models to their data, not the other way around. And much of that data resides in AWS as the clear market segment leader in cloud infrastructure. We're innovating and delivering at a rapid rate and our approach is resonating with customers. The number of companies building generative AI apps in AWS is substantial and growing very quickly, including Adidas, Booking.com, Bridgewater, Clariant, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips and United Airlines, to name a few. We are also seeing success with generative AI start-ups like Perplexity.ai who chose to go all in with AWS, including running future models in Trainium and Inferentia. And the AWS team has a lot of new capabilities to share with its customers at its upcoming AWS re :Invent conference. Beyond AWS, all of our significant businesses are working on generative AI applications to transform their customer experiences. There are too many for me to name on this call but a few examples include, in our stores business, we're using generative AI to help people better discover products they want to more easily access the information needed to make decisions. We use generative AI models to forecast inventory we need in our various locations and to derive optimal last mile transportation routes for drivers to employ. We're also making it much easier for our third-party sellers to create new product pages by entering much less information and letting the models to the rest. In advertising, we just launched a generative AI image generation tool, where all brands need to do is upload a product photo and description to quickly create unique lifestyle images that will help customers discover products they love. And in Alexa, we built a much more expansive LLM and previewed the early version of this. Apart from being a more intelligent version of herself, Alexa's new conversational AI capabilities include the ability to make multiple requests at once as well as more natural and conversational requests without having to use specific phrases. We continue to be convicted that the vision of being the world's best personal assistant is a compelling and viable one and that Alexa has a good chance to be one of the long-term winners in this arena. Every one of our businesses is building generative AI applications to change what's possible for customers and we have a lot more to come. We're also encouraged by the progress we're making in our newer initiatives. Just to name a few, we're pleased with what we're seeing in Prime Video. Prime Video continues to be an integral part of the Prime value proposition where it's often one of the top 2 drivers of customers signing up for Prime. We also have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business in its own right as we continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for prime members but also offer the best selection of premium streaming video content anywhere with our marketplace offering, including channels for customers who can subscribe to channels like Max, Paramount+, BET Plus and MGM+, as well as our broad transaction video-on-demand selection. As we continue to invest in compelling content, beginning in early 2024, Prime Video shows and movies will include limited advertisements. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. If customers prefer and add free option, we plan to offer that for an additional $2.99 per month for U.S. members. There is still a lot of work to be done in innovation ahead but we're excited about our future on Prime Video. We're seeing progress on a number of our investments that expand our ability to serve more consumers and sellers in their e-commerce missions. Our emerging international stores continue to improve their customer experiences and profitability and are on a strong trajectory. Both consumers and sellers are excited about Buy with Prime which enables third-party sellers with direct-to-consumer websites to offer Amazon Prime members the same fast payments and delivery options they receive on Amazon.com. We recently announced the capability for sellers to integrate Buy with Prime with their Shopify account, making it easier for Shopify merchants to manage their businesses with inventory pricing and promotions automatically synced in one place. And we're seeing very positive early response from sellers to Supply Chain by Amazon, a fully automated set of supply chain services where Amazon can pick up inventory from manufacturing facilities around the world, ship it across borders, handle customs clearance and ground transportation, store inventory in bulk, manage replenishment across Amazon and other sales channels and deliver directly to customers, all without sellers having to worry about managing their supply chain. Our health care team is continuing to make health care easier for people to access. The Amazon Pharmacy customer experience has significantly evolved this year and customers are responding that both in their purchasing behavior and qualitative feedback. We built RXPass for customers to get unlimited supply of eligible medications for $5 per month, meaningfully reduce the cost for customers to get insulin and diabetes products and partnered with Blue Shield of California to offer a first-of-its-kind model to provide more affordable pharmacy care to its 4.8 million members, providing fast and free delivery of prescription medications and 24/7 access to pharmacists. We remain convinced that we can be part of the solution of making health care a better customer experience. And our low Earth orbit satellite initiative Project Kuiper which aims to bring fast, affordable broadband to underserved communities around the world, took a meaningful step forward in the last few weeks with the successful launch of 2 prototype satellites. We will use this multi-month mission to test our satellites and network from space and collect data ahead of the planned start of satellite production later this year. I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world who are gearing up for 2 of our most significant events across the company. First, our annual AWS re :Invent conference that begins on November 27. The team is excited to share a lot of new capabilities with customers and provide an array of opportunities for builders to learn and connect with one another. And on the stores side, we've already kicked off what will be our 29th holiday shopping season. Prime Big Deal Days held earlier this month was our most successful October holiday kick-off event ever, with Prime members saving more than $1 billion across hundreds and millions of items sold. Just as we do all year long, we aim to make our customers' lives easier and better every day and there's no time where it's more important to us that we deliver on this mission than during the busy holiday shopping season. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw a strong performance in the third quarter. Worldwide revenue was $143.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $100 million above the top end of our guidance range. We saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever which was $11.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion year-over-year from $2.7 billion above the high end of our guidance range. North America revenue was $87.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. And international revenue was $32.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange. During the quarter, we held our biggest Prime Day event ever with prime members purchasing more than 375 million items worldwide and saving more than $2.5 billion on millions of deals across the Amazon store. Outside of Prime Day, we continue to see strong demand across everyday essentials, including categories like beauty and health and personal care. From a customer behavior standpoint, we still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals, coupled with lower spending on discretionary items. Building on the momentum from last quarter, we set another record for delivery speed. For the year-to-date period through the third quarter, we have delivered at the fastest speeds ever in the United States. These improvements in delivery speeds have been a key driver of growth and are resulting in increased purchase frequency by our Prime members. Third-party sellers grew at 18% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by selection expansion and growing adoption of our optional services for sellers, including Fulfillment by Amazon and paid account management and more. During the quarter, we hosted Amazon Accelerate, our annual seller conference, where we launched a number of new innovations and product developments for our sellers, including Supply Chain by Amazon. We also continue to see durable growth in advertising which grew 25% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by sponsored products as we lean into machine learning to improve the relevancy of the ads we show our customers and enhance our measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers. We have seen strong improvement in our profitability. North America operating income was $4.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9%, up 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen 6 consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of over 700 basis points over these past 6 quarters. The third quarter marked the second full quarter of regionalization within the U.S. and we're pleased with the early results. Regionalization has allowed us to simplify the network by reducing the number of line-haul lanes, increasing volume within existing line-haul lanes and adding more direct fulfillment center to delivery station connections. We have also been focused on optimizing inventory placement in a new regionalized network which when coupled with the simplification mentioned earlier, is helping contribute to an overall reduction in cost to serve. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw benefits from lower inflation, primarily within line haul, ocean and rail shipping rates which were partially offset by higher fuel prices. While we are encouraged by the improvements in operating profit, we still see a lot of opportunity in front of us. In international, we were closer to breakeven during the quarter with an operating loss of $95 million. This was an improvement of $2.4 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through higher productivity, decreased inflationary pressures and improvements in leverage across our established and emerging international countries as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. Moving to AWS; revenues were $23.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $900 million of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, while optimization still remain a headwind, we've seen the rate of new cost optimization slowdown in AWS and we are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline. Customers are excited about our approach to generative AI, with several new announcements made during the quarter, including a strategic collaboration with Anthropic, opening Amazon Bedrock up to general availability, adding Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock in the near future and new customization capabilities of CodeWhisperer. AWS remains a clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position in the number of customers, the size of our partner ecosystem, our breadth of functionality and the strongest operational performance in the industry. When we look at the fundamentals of the business, we believe we are in good position to drive future growth as the rates of cost optimization slow down. AWS operating income was $7 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%. This is an improvement of approximately 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by increased leverage on our head count costs. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $20.2 billion, an improvement of $41.7 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income which we're seeing across all 3 of our segments. Key drivers of this improvement include reductions in our cost to serve, continued advertising growth and improved leverage on our fixed costs. We are also seeing improvements in working capital, notably with our inventory efficiency as we improve our inventory placement. Now, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $50 billion for the trailing 12-month period ended September 30, down from $60 billion in the comparable prior year period. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be approximately $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation CapEx to be down year-over-year, partially offset by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. Looking at our operations network, our inventory is the best position it's ever been heading into the holiday season, enabling us to serve customers with fast delivery speeds from their local regions. We continue to believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin, your line is live. Justin Post : I'll ask about AWS. I guess the first question is, as you look forward in the fourth quarter, you mentioned you've signed some new deals. Are you seeing less cost optimization as you look forward? Or do you think it will be similar to Q3? And then second, you couldn't help but notice the big margin improvement in AWS all the way back to where you were 7 quarters ago. Could you talk about the drivers and sustainability of those margins? Andrew Jassy : Yes, Justin. Sure. This is Andy. I think if you look at AWS, we grew 12% year-over-year. And I think that you saw a continued stabilization of our year-over-year growth rate. And included $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue which it's hard to compare and do the math across different players because not everyone discloses them clearly. But as far as we can tell, that also looks like the most absolute growth of any of the players out there. We're still seeing elevated customer optimization levels than we've seen in the last year or year before this, I should say. So if you look at the optimization, it's more than a year ago but it's meaningfully attenuating from where we've seen in the last few quarters. And if you look at the optimization too, what's interesting is it's not all customers deciding to shut down workloads. A very significant portion of the optimization are customers taking advantage of enhanced price performance capabilities in AWS and making use of it. So for example, if you look at the growth of customers using EC2 instances that are Graviton based which is our custom chip that we built for generalized CPUs, the number of people and the percentage of instances launched their Graviton base as opposed to Intel or AMD base is very substantially higher than it was before. And one of the things that customers love about Graviton is that it provides 40% better price performance than the other leading x86 processors. So you see a lot of growth in Graviton. You also see a lot of customers who are moving from the hourly on demand rates for significant portions of their workloads to 1- to 3-year commitments which we call savings plans. So those are just good examples of some of the cost optimization that customers are making in less certain economies where it's really good for customers short and long term and I think it's also good for us. But we're starting to see -- as I said, we're seeing that optimization attenuate. I expect that to continue over time. I remain very optimistic about AWS in the medium to long term. And it's because we have the most functionality by a large amount. We have a much larger partner ecosystem than you'll find elsewhere. We have stronger security and operational performance than you can find elsewhere. I think we're the most customer-focused. Even if you look during optimization times in this difficult economy, customers have really noticed how AWS leaned in with them for the long term. And I think that matters to customers. And then we have a $92 billion revenue run rate business where 90% of the global IT spend still resides on premises. And if you believe like we do, that equation is going to flip. There's a lot more there for us. And then you look at the very substantial gigantic new generative AI opportunity which I believe will be tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AWS over the next several years, I think we have a unique and broad approach that's really resonating with customers. And you can see it with the array of customers I mentioned that are using us and starting to build workloads for generative AI who have already on top of us. I could see it also. Just the growth rate for us in generative AI is very fast. Again, I have seen a lot of different numbers publicly. It's real hard to measure an apples-to-apples. But in our best estimation, our -- the amount of growth we're seeing and the absolute amount of generative AI business we're seeing compares very favorably with anything else I've seen externally. So I think that you can see that in the deals that we're doing, too. I spoke about the significant number of deals that we've closed over the last couple of months. A lot of those conversations, it's -- a big piece of it is what I mentioned earlier, the functionality, the ecosystem, the operational performance, the security, how you take care of customers but also whether or not they like your vision and set of products that you're building in this brand-new technology space, generative AI which I think has been very effective so far. So to me, I think there's a lot of growth in front of AWS. I'm very optimistic about it. Brian Olsavsky : And Justin, on your comment about -- a question about AWS margins. So yes, the margin improved 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter, an increase of income of $1.6 billion quarter-over-quarter for AWS, is driven by -- primarily by our headcount reductions in Q2 and also continued slowness in hiring, rehiring open positions. There's been also a lot of cost control in non-people categories, things like infrastructure costs and also discretionary costs. Natural gas prices and other energy costs have come down a bit in Q3 as well. So as we've said historically, the margins on -- the operating margin for AWS is going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and this is a good example of that. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : Can you just talk more about how the regional fulfillment network is exceeding your expectations? And then also, how does that support your confidence in moving North America beyond mid-single-digit margin levels? And then just perhaps on generative AI, obviously, a lot of innovation here. You talked about a number of different customers running early workloads. How should we think about the timing, just to drive some tangible monetization there? Brian Olsavsky : Well, I'll start. The -- on regionalization, I think it was such a significant change for us in the network. It's hard to really appreciate with a big change across so many dimensions it was that first to make such a change has all sorts of risk. And I think the team did a great job planning around it being very thorough. I think that we were able, with our placement algorithms, to get more regional local in-stock levels than we anticipated. And then I think until you actually put all the connections together, we changed a lot of the connections from a lot of these middle connections going from fulfillment centers to sortation centers and then to delivery stations to connecting the fulfillment centers and delivery stations more directly which, of course, is easier to do when you have more local in stock in a region. But I think that we were able -- the connections that we made and the optimization that we made there allowed us to get shorter transportation distances than we even anticipated in items to people a lot quicker. And then always one of the issues you got to worry about when you make a change that big is whether or not you end up splitting shipments and having more -- fewer items per box and per shipment. And that was also something that we really had to work through in the design and in the early stages and we've gotten a lot better on. So we're just across the board, we're seeing shorter transportation distances and much faster delivery to customers. And when you deliver faster delivery to customers, they actually start to consider you for a lot more items than they otherwise would. I think it's part of what -- if you look at our very significant growth rates right now in everyday essentials and consumables, a lot of it is when you -- if you're going to order something which you need in the same day or next day, you're not going to consider it if it's coming in 3 or 4 days. But when you're consistently getting it in same day or the next day, just changes what you're willing to do. I think the second question was on gen AI and the timing of monetization. What I would tell you is that we have been surprised at the pace of growth in generative AI. Our generative AI business is growing very, very quickly, as I mentioned earlier. And almost by any measure, it's a pretty significant business for us already. And yet I would also say that companies are still in the relatively early stages. I mean now you have to get perspective. My perspective is that the cloud is still in the early stages. If you think about 90% plus of the global IT spend being on-premises, where I think that equation is going to flip in 10 years. I think cloud is early. So if you -- with that lens on, I still think we're very early in generative AI. And what's interesting, too, around generative AI because we have so many companies who are doing all sorts of prototypes and it's really accelerating very rapidly on the training side with Trainium and Inferentia and then on the application building and running side with Bedrock, is that companies are still trying to sort out for themselves what they're going to run at large-scale production in all of these areas. Because what happens is you try a model, you test the model, you like the results of the model and then you plug it into your application. And what a lot of companies figure out quickly is that using the really large -- the large models and the large sizes ends up often being more expensive than what they anticipated and what they want to spend on that application. And sometimes too much latency in getting the answers as it shovels through the really large models. And so customers are experimenting with lots of different types of models and then different model sizes to get the cost and latency characteristics that they need for different use cases. And it's one of the things that I think is so useful about Bedrock is that customers are trying so many variants right now but to have a service that not only lets you leverage lots of third party as well as Amazon large language miles but also lots of different sizes and then makes the transition of moving those workloads easy between them is very advantageous. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question, I have two, one on AWS, one on the retail business. On AWS AI Andy, I recognize you have a pretty multipronged AI approach. But just could you talk us through sort of one or two of the early generative AI products where you're seeing the most early demand and interest? And as you talk to customers, are there still hurdles or pain points that you're not quite serving in your product suite you look to solve and innovate on over the next couple of years in AI? And then the second one, you made a lot of steps on the regionalization of warehouses and making it more efficient. Where are you on robotics in the warehouses? And how should we think about the potential impact of that to drive profitability even higher? Andrew Jassy : On the AI side, I think that if you're looking for some of the products that we're offering that are -- that have a lot of early resonance and traction, I would -- I'd start with Bedrock. These customers are -- they're very excited about Bedrock. And it's making it so much easier to get applications, generative AI applications built. And again, it's machine learning and AI has been something that people have been excited about for 25 years. In my opinion, about a half dozen years ago, it took a pretty significant leap forward where it was much easier given the economics and scalability of compute and storage and then some of the tools that we built like SageMaker, it was much easier for everyday developers to start to interact with AI. But it just -- it took another meaningful step forward with generative AI but still it's complicated to actually figure out which models you want to work, you want to use and how you actually want to employ them and trying to make sure you have the right results, trying to make sure you get safe results, trying to make sure you end up with a cost structure and a customer experience that you want. And so it's hard. And customers will like -- there's a certain number of customers who have very deep AI expert practitioners but most companies don't. And so Bedrock just takes so much of the difficulty out of those decisions and those variables that people are very excited about Bedrock. They're using it in a very broad way. They're extremely excited about not just the set of models in there but if you look at a leader like Anthropic and the ability for our customers in Bedrock to have exclusive early access to models and customization tools and fine-tuning which gives them more control, there's just -- there's a lot of buzz and a lot of usage and a lot of traction around Bedrock. I would also say our chips, Trainium and Inferentia, as most people know, there's a real shortage right now in the industry in chips. It's really hard to get the amount of GPUs that everybody wants. And so it's just another reason why Trainium and Inferentia are so attractive to people. They have better price performance characteristics than the other options out there but also the fact that you can get access to them. And we've done, I think, a pretty good job providing supply there and ordering meaningfully in advance as well. And so you're seeing very large LLM providers make big bets on those chips. I think Anthropic deciding to train their future LLM model on Trainium and using Inferentia as well is really a statement. And then you look at the really hot start-up Perplexity.ai, who also just made a decision to do all their training and inference on top of Trainium and Inferentia. So those are 2 examples. I'd say CodeWhisperer, too, is just, again, it's just a game changer if you can allow your engineers not to have to do the more repetitive work of cutting and pasting and building certain functions that really, if somebody knew your code base better, could do. And so it's a real -- it's a productivity game changer for developers. And then actually launching that customization vehicle so that they actually understand your own proprietary code base, that is something that customers are quite excited about. So those are ultimately early traction AI. There's so much more to provide, Brian. I mean there's -- I think people -- even though Bedrock is so much easier to use than people trying to build models themselves and build the applications, I think people are still looking to find ways to make it easier to look at a big corpus of data and run an agent on top of it or maybe they don't have to do all that work themselves. I think people are looking for automated ways to understand developer environments and be able to ask any question on the developer environment. So there's a lot more. It's going to be a long time before we run out of services. And yes, I think it's a good thing to look toward the next few months in re :Invent to see the additional things that team launches. I think on the robotics piece, it's a very significant investment for us. It has been for several years. It's made a huge difference for us. It's made a big difference for us both on the productivity side, on the cost side as well as importantly on the safety side where we can have our teammates working on things that are even safer than what they get to work on today. We have a very substantial investment of additional robotics initiatives, I would say many of which are coming to fruition in 2024 and 2025 that we think will make a further additional impact on the cost and productivity and safety and our fulfillment service. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe one follow-up on AWS and one on the ads business. Andy, would love your perspective. The cloud optimization theme started in the second half of '22 when there were a lot of macro concerns. And then the AI theme really only sort of came to the forefront in the last 8 or 9 months. What's your perspective on how turning the calendar into 2024 and there being a new IT budget cycle could possibly lead us to put the optimization theme in the background and some of the AI theme come more to the forefront when there might be more distinct budgeting around AI as a theme? That would be number one. And then in your ads business, you're approaching $50 billion run rate and it's compounding in the mid-20s. What are you most excited about on the initiative front to continue to build scale both on Amazon properties and possibly off Amazon as a broader digital advertising player? Andrew Jassy : On the AWS side, my perspective, we'll obviously all have to wait and see to some extent. But my perspective is that in 2024, you're going to -- I think a lot of the relatively low-hanging fruit on optimization has happened in 2023. It's not to say there won't be any more optimization. It's just that there's more low-hanging fruit when you have very large footprints and you've built a lot of applications on a platform for you to go decide to optimize if that's what you want to go do. And so I think 2020 -- we're already seeing it now with the attenuation of optimization over the last several months. But I think you'll continue to see the attenuation continue and we're already seeing more and more companies that are turning their attention to newer initiatives. And I think what you will see in '24 and '25 as well, I think -- I don't think it's a 1-year deal, I think that's going to be a several-year trajectory, is that you're going to just see a lot of companies not just looking at the new generative AI workloads but also there was a significant number of new customer transformations where companies were going to largely move from being on-premises to being in the cloud. That got stalled in 2023 because companies were being more conservative with their spend and wary of an uncertain economy. And so I think that what you'll see increasingly is that companies will both go back to those transformations they were planning on making and working with a lot of systems integrator partners as well as ourselves as well as start to see the production in large scale of the generative AI applications that they're all working on and prototyping and starting to deploy into production. I think on the ad front, well, there's a lot I'm excited about on the ad side as well. I think that it's interesting what's happened in our ads business as if you look around the industry, most advertising-heavy companies have struggled growth-wise as the economy has been difficult. And while we see companies being more cautious on the ad side and the top-of-funnel products, things like display and a little bit of video, we're still seeing a lot of strength in the lower-funnel ad products like sponsored products. And I think in these types of economies, we have fared pretty well in part because we have a number of owned and operated properties that have very large volumes that advertisers and brands want to get in front of. Even in a harder economy, there's going to be a lot of e-commerce purchasing. So people want to be in front of our customers in our marketplace. Or take Thursday Night Football which is we're in our second season of Thursday Night Football and off to a great start, the ratings are 25% higher than they were a year ago through 6 weeks. But also, we're doing much better on the advertising side than we did in our first year and that's a property that's really valuable. It's the one game that week and advertisers want to be in front of customers because there's 13 million customers a week watching. So I think part of it is because we have owned and operated properties that have a lot of volume. And then I think the other piece is that most of our resource in the advertising side is spent on machine learning expert practitioners who are owning algorithms to make sure that the sponsor results people get when they search on something are relevant. And because of that, those ads perform better for advertisers. So when they have to think about budget decisions, they're going to choose the ones that have large volume and perform better. I think both of those are real advantages in our advertising area right now. In terms of additional things we're excited about. I think that we have barely scraped the surface with respect to figuring out how to intelligently integrate advertising into video, into audio and into grocery. So I think we're early days in that. I think that we also started externalizing some of our products like sponsored products to third-party websites. And you see that with what we've done with Pinterest, Hearst Newspapers and BuzzFeed, so I think there's -- again, we're still pretty early in that area but it's growing well and we're very focused on continuing to in a great customer experience. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney : Okay. On those AWS deals Andy, that you talked about in the September quarter, was there something different about those deals, different industry, different verticals, different geographic markets? Or is it just kind of a resumption of kind of the deal flow that you've had in years past? So that's the first question. And secondly, Brian, international. Is international finally at a point where it can be sustainably profitable going forwards, maybe except for the seasonally challenged March quarter? Have you wrung out enough efficiencies and gotten enough scales? And the oldest markets there are big enough and scalable enough and profitable enough that it offsets the newer countries? Have you finally reached that point? Brian Olsavsky : First, just to give Andy a break. On international, thanks for your question. Yes, the quarter was just short of breakeven. And as you pointed out, that's a departure from kind of prior trends. I would answer that question this way. There's multiple things going on internationally. In our established countries, U.K., Germany, Japan, France, those countries are profitable and have been profitable. And we continue to work on price selection and convenience. And all that retail base is essentially adding sellers, adding vendors and selection, scaling advertising and improving the cost structure of our ops network. So many of the ops productivity initiatives, probably with the exception of regionalization, is more of a U.S. side right now. But we're working on all those productivity elements and speed concurrently globally. And you're seeing that internationally and customers are responding. On the emerging side, over the last 6 years, we've launched 10 new countries. History has shown us that those all take time to grow into profitability. The U.S. took 10 years -- excuse me, 9 years originally. And they're all on their own journey there with growth and scale and profitability and selection and a number of other variables. So that's -- those are all going well as well. We continue -- we're going to continue to invest internationally in things like Prime and expanding Prime benefits and we're going to continue to build out the fulfillment and transportation networks to better serve customers. So I can't say it's permanently we've reached a breakeven threshold for profitability. I think the trend lines are clear, though and we'll continue to work on accelerating that journey in all countries, especially the emerging ones. Andrew Jassy : On the AWS deals, it's a really broad mix of industries and geographies. So it's not comped up in one. Some are kind of first really big deals from customers. Some of them are very large expansions of existing agreements where they've gone from call it, 20% of their workloads to 50% of their workloads moving to AWS in the cloud. It's also -- I'm not even really including in that number, a number of really big public sector deals that we've done over the last chunk of time that won't hit for a period of time; and so all these deals don't hit in a month. They happen over a period of time as you help those customers safely transition and migrate their workloads to AWS. But it hasn't been any one piece. And I wish I could tell you we knew exactly why they're starting to happen in faster numbers. I do think, in general, historically, deal volume tends to be lumpy and it doesn't perfectly distribute over a calendar year. I do think though that we've seen this in '23, for sure, that the time to close deals lengthened. And I think it's all reflective of what most companies in the world have been thinking about the last year which is just in the face of uncertain economy, you're going to be more conservative. There are going to be more people involved. You're going to spend more time on how you can save on your existing cost instead of migrating new workloads or thinking about signing new deals. And so I think what you're just starting to see along with some of the optimization attenuation is that companies are starting to look forward again. And so we've just seen a collection of those the last couple of months that had been -- being discussed for several months where I think, frankly, both sides thought they would close faster but just went slower than they did. So I just think you're starting to see companies look forward more. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us today for the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello and welcome to our Q4 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's use as of today, February 1, 2024, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially, additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't include any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements, it's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Jassy : Thanks, Dave. Today we\u2019re reporting $170 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, $13.2 billion in operating income, up 383% year-over-year, or $10.5 billion and $35.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $48.3 billion year-over-year.  While we've made meaningful progress in our financial measures, what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, adjusting and reimagining from teams across Amazon.  Looking back at Q4, I'll start with our stores business where customers responded to our continued focus on selection price and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection with hundreds and millions of products available and added tens of millions of new items last year alone, including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's Secrets Fashion, Pit Viper, and Beyonce\u2019s Renaissance to our Merge to cosmetics from Lancome, Urban Decay, cosmetics and No Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, to consumer technology and services from Boost, Infinite, and Woop to homewares for Martha Stewart.  Being sharp on price is always important. But particularly in an uncertain economy where customers are careful about how much they're spending. We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever. These events also helped attract new customers and Prime members.  Throughout the quarter customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day including more than 4 billion in the U.S and more than 2 billion in Europe.  In the U.S this result is the combination of two things, one is the benefit of regionalization, where we\u2019ve architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the U.S in the fourth quarter, we increase the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year. As we're able to get customers items this fast. It increases the number of occasions that customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs. And we can see that in all sorts of areas including how fast or everyday essentials business is growing.  Our regionalization efforts have also brought transportation distances down which has helped lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we've reduced our cost-to-serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S alone, cost-to-serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit compared to the prior year. Lowering cost-to-serve allows us not only to invest in speed improvements, but also afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices or ASPs and profitably. We have a saying, that it's not hard to lower prices, it's hard to be able to afford lowering prices. The same is true with adding selection, it's not hard to add lower ASPs selection, it's hard to be able to afford offering lower ASPs selection and still like the economics. Like improving speed, adding selection puts us in the consideration set for more purchases.  As we look toward 2024 and beyond, we're not done lowering our cost to serve. We've challenged every closely held belief for our fulfillment network and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there's more upside for us.  Alongside our stores business, our advertising growth remains strong, up 26% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We've recently added Sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S. a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business.  While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach engage viewers on Twitch, Freevee, Fire TV and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the U.S., as well as Thursday Night Football.  Shifting to AWS. Revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year in Q4 versus 12% year-over-year in Q3. And we're now approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion. We watched the incremental revenue added each quarter and in Q4 AWS added more than $1.1 billion an incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which on an FX neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell. While cost optimization continued to attenuate larger new deals also accelerated, evidenced by recently inked agreements with Salesforce, BMW, NVIDIA, LG, Hyundai, Merck, MUFG, Axiata, Cafe, BYD, Arcore, Amgen, and SAIC.  Our customer pipeline remains strong, as existing customers are renewing larger commitments over longer periods and migrations are growing. 2023 also was a very significant year of delivery and customer trial for generative AI or Gen AI in AWS. You may remember that we've explained our vision of three distinct layers in the Gen AI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which were deeply investing. At the bottom layer, where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute with a chip is the key component in that compute, we offer the most expansive collection of compute instances with NVIDIA chips.  We also have customers who would like us to push the price performance envelope on AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips, which are 40% more price performance than other X86 alternatives. And as a result, we built custom AI training chips, named Trainium, and inference chips, name Inferentia. At re :Invent we announced Trainium2, which offers four times faster training performance and three times more memory capacity versus the first generation of Trainium, enabling advantageous price performance versus alternatives.  We already have several customers using our AI chips including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh and Snap. In the middle layer where companies seek to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and leverage AWS\u2019 security and other features all as a managed service. We've launched Bedrock which is off to a very strong start with many 1,000s of customers using the service after just a few months.  The team continues to rapidly iterate on Bedrock, recently delivering capabilities including guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, knowledge bases to expand models knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation or RAG and real time queries, agents to complete multi step tasks and fine tuning to keep teaching and refining models. All which will help customers applications be higher quality and have better customer experiences.  We also added new models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta with Llama2, Stability AI and our own Amazon Titan family of LLMs. What customers have learned at this early stage of Gen AI, is it there's meaningful iteration required in building a production Gen AI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customers don't want only one model, they want different models for different types of applications, and different size models for different applications.  Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple and this is what Bedrock does, which is why so many customers are excited about it. And to top layer of the stack is the application layer, one of the very best early gen AI applications is a coded companion. At Reinvent, we launched Amazon Q, which is an expert on AWS, writes code, debugs code, tests code, does translations like moving from an old version of Java to a new one and can also query customer\u2019s various data repositories, like Internet, Wickes or from over 40 different popular connectors to data in Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Elastin or Zendesk, among others. And answer questions, summarize this data, carry on a coherent conversation and take action. It was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start, making it easier for organizations to use generative AI safely. Q is the most capable work assistant and another service that customers are very excited about. By the way, don't underestimate the point about Bedrock and Q inheriting the same security and access control as customers get with AWS. Security is a big deal, an important differentiator between cloud providers. The data in these models is some of the company's most sensitive and critical assets. With AWS' advantaged security capabilities and track record relative to other providers, we continue to see momentum around customers wanting to do their long-term Gen AI work with AWS. We're building dozens of Gen AI apps across Amazon's businesses, several of which have launched and others of which are in development. This morning, we launched Rufus, an expert shopping assistant trained on our product and customer data that represents a significant customer experience improvement for Discovery.  Rufus lets customers ask shopping journey questions like what is the best golf ball to use for better spin control or which are the best cold weather rain jackets and get thoughtful explanations for what matters and recommendations on products. You can carry on a conversation with Rufus on other related or unrelated questions and retains context coherently. You can sift through our rich product pages by asking Rufus questions on any product features and will return answers quickly. We're at the start of what Rufus will do with further personalization and expansion coming, but we're excited about how it will make discovery even easier on Amazon. Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon, primarily because there are a few initiatives, if any, that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes, and we believe it will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years. In addition to our stores and AWS businesses, we continue to make progress on newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term. Touching on two of them. In October, we had a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper, which is our low earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400 million to 500 million households who don't have it today. We launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems, made a 2-way video call, streamed a Prime Video movie in Ultra HD 4K and made an Amazon purchase over our end-to-end communication network. It's rare to be able to exercise all these elements in an initial launch like this. We're on track to launch our first production satellite in the first half of 2024 and started beta testing in the second half of the year. We've still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress. During the quarter, we also completed our second season of Thursday Night Football, which was a rousing success by all accounts. The customer experience continued to improve as our talent, production, streaming quality, analytics, unique AI features like Prime Vision and defensive alerts, all took big leaps forward on top of the very good start last year. We launched a new NFL tradition with the inaugural Black Friday football game and our continuous innovation resonated with viewers as the number of people watching increased 24% year-over-year and with advertisers as we made dramatic year-over-year gains in ad sales. We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own, and we'll continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members like Thursday Night Football, Go To The Rings, Reacher, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Citadel and more. And with the ads in Prime Video, we'll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time. I'll close by reiterating that 2023 was a really good year. I'm grateful to all of our teams who delivered on behalf of customers. Yet I think every one of us at Amazon believes this is just the start of what's possible. We have a long way to go in every one of our businesses before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw strong performance in the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue was $170 billion, representing an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $3 billion above the top end of our guidance range. Saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $13.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 billion year-over-year and $2.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. For the full year 2023, we had a meaningful improvement across our financial results. Revenue was $574.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Operating income tripled year-over-year to $36.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $35.5 billion, up $48.3 billion versus last year. These financial outputs are a result of a lot of improvements in our key input metrics such as stores' cost to serve, which decreased year-over-year for the first time since 2018 and our ability to deliver to customers at our fastest speeds ever. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our teammates around the world for a very strong 2023 performance. Focusing on the fourth quarter, North America revenue was $105.5 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year and an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. International revenue was $40.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, also an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. During the quarter, we remained focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers, price, selection and convenience. Our shopping events throughout the quarter included Prime Big Deal Days in October and our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping event helped to attract new Prime members and deliver billions in savings for customers. We made meaningful progress on delivery speeds in the United States and globally, which helped strong sales throughout the quarter, including notable strength in the last-minute gifting where our ability to provide fast shipping helped our Prime members ensure that they got their gifts before the holidays. These improvements in delivery speed have led to increased purchase frequency by our Prime members across all of our major geographies. It also strengthened demand for our everyday essentials. Categories like beauty and health and personal care, where speed is even more important to customers. Third-party sellers were a big part of our success over the holidays with worldwide third-party seller services revenue growing at 19% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 61%, its highest level ever. We also saw strong performance in worldwide advertising, which grew 26% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products as our teams worked hard to increase the relevancy of the ads we show customers by leveraging machine learning. Advertising only works if the ads are helpful to customers and there's a lot of value in tailoring sponsored products, so they are relevant to what a customer is actually searching for. We're also continually focused on improving our measurement capabilities, which allow brands to see the payback of their advertising spend. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $6.5 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 6.1%, up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins were at their recent low levels in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen seven consecutive quarters of improvement resulting in a cumulative improvement of 800 basis points over these past seven quarters. In addition to the strong top line growth, which helped to drive improved leverage throughout our businesses, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost to serve. The fourth quarter is our busiest time of year, supported by an increasingly large and integrated operations network. Overall, our teams executed extremely well, yielding strong efficiency gains with minimal disruptions. We were pleased with the performance of our regionalized network during the holiday period, where we saw benefits from improved inventory placement helping drive faster speeds and also lowering costs. We also continue to see benefits from lower transportation rates, which include linehaul, ocean and rail and from a more stable labor market, resulting in improved staffing levels. In our International segment, we had an operating loss of $419 million, an improvement of $1.8 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through increased units per box, lower transportation rates and leverage across our fixed costs as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. The International segment represents more than 20 countries of varying degrees of growth and our largest established countries like the U.K., Germany and Japan, relatively strong revenue growth contributed to the year-over-year improvement in profitability. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they continued to expand their customer offerings, while seeking to invest wisely. Moving to AWS. Revenues were $24.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $1.1 billion of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, we continue to see the diminishing impact of cost optimizations. And as these optimization slow down, we're seeing more companies turning their attention to newer initiatives and reaccelerating existing migrations. Customers are also excited about our approach to generative AI. Still relatively early days, but the revenues are accelerating rapidly across all 3 layers and our approach to democratizing AI is resonating well with our customers. We have seen significant interest from our customers wanting to run generative AI applications and build large language models and foundation models, all with the privacy, reliability and security they have grown accustomed to with AWS. AWS' operating income was $7.2 billion, an increase of $2 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.6%, up more than 500 basis points year-over-year and effectively flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This margin improvement reflects our headcount reductions from earlier in the year and a slowdown in the pace of hiring. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $35.5 billion, an improvement of $48.3 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we are seeing across all three of our segments. We're also seeing improvements in working capital, notably in inventory efficiency driven by our regionalization efforts. Next, let's turn to capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, full year CapEx was $48.4 billion, which was down $10.2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by lower spend on fulfillment and transportation. As we look forward to 2024, we anticipate CapEx to increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models. One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from 5 years to 6 years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers. With that, let's move on to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the questions. I'm just going to do a 2-parter on AWS. If we take a step back, can you talk a little bit about the contribution from backlog conversion, AI workloads and some elements that allowed you to reaccelerate revenue at AWS in Q4 and how we should think about those components from an exit velocity standpoint into 2024? And then against your broader comments on CapEx, any color on how we should be thinking about AI-driven CapEx within the AWS initiatives against the broader CapEx commentary? Thank you. Dave Fildes : Yes, that's right. This is Dave. Just to give you that -- the balance was $155.7 billion as of 12/31. So that's up more than $45 billion year-over-year and $20 billion quarter-over-quarter. Brian Olsavsky : And then if you look back at the revenue growth, it accelerated to 13.2% in Q4 as we just mentioned. That was an acceleration. We expect accelerating trends to continue into 2024. We're excited about the migrate -- continuous their resumption, I guess, of migrations that companies may have put on hold during 2023 in some cases and interest in our generative AI and products, like Bedrock and as Andy was describing that. On the CapEx side, let me talk in total for the company. We had $48 billion in 2023 was down $10 billion year-over-year. We talked about during the year quite a bit. A lot of the mix of investment in 2023 was tied to infrastructure, mostly supporting AWS but also supporting our core Amazon businesses was about 60% of our spend. So it reached a very high percentage. We anticipate those trends continuing into 2024. CapEx will go up in 2024. I'm not giving a number today, but we do -- we're still working through plans for the year, but we do expect CapEx to rise as we add capacity in AWS for region expansions, but primarily the work we're doing with generative AI projects. In the fulfillment center and logistics area, I would say it's more incremental capacity at this point based on additional demand, although we are seeing some additional investments for same-day delivery sites and automation, robotics. But the trend for most of the large percentage of the spend will be in infrastructure is going to continue into 2024. Andrew Jassy : I\u2019ll add a few things to what Brian said. I think just as it relates to the first part of the question, just the way to think about backlog conversion is just these are deals that we've signed that are long-term deals typically with customers. And then there's some amount of time it takes where we work with those customers to migrate those workloads. And so some of the trends that we have seen over the last quarter.  First of all, I think that the lion's share of cost optimization has happened. It's not that there won't be any more or that we don't see anymore, but it's just attenuated very significantly. And at the same time, what we've seen is that migrations and this speaks to some of the backlog, migrations that were proceeding, but maybe not at the pace that we saw before, have started to pick up again. We've also seen that a number of the deals that typically signed more quickly, but were signing more slowly in more uncertain environments. A lot of those got done in the last quarter, and you heard in my opening remarks some of the examples, but that was some of several, and we're continuing to see that trend.  And then on the Gen AI side, it's -- if you look at the Gen AI revenue we have, in absolute numbers, it's a pretty big number, but in the scheme of a $100 billion annual revenue run rate business, it's still relatively small, much smaller than what it will be in the future, where we really believe we're going to drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years. But it's encouraging how fast it's growing and our offering is really resonating with customers. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Andy, the first one is sort of on the cost to serve comments coming down for the first time since 2018. As you sort of look into '24 and '25, can you just sort of walk us through some of the key operational blocking and tackling this to happen to continue to drive down that cost of serve back to 2018 levels? Or however you're thinking about your North Star from that perspective?  And then the second one is on sort of philosophical about capital returns. It looks like the cash balance could start building pretty nicely here. How do you think about the idea of buybacks, share repurchases or some type of capital return programs to sort of help shareholders out? Andrew Jassy : Thank you, Brian, I appreciate it. I'll take the first, and I'll let Brian take the second. On the cost to serve coming down, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I don't think that we feel like where we're going to ultimately be. I think we feel like we have meaningful upside there. And I think one thing that it's easy to make as large a change as we made in regionalization in the U.S. and saying, check, we got that done. But the reality is, we still have several improvements and a bunch of ways that we can hone the regionalization improvements that we made in 2023 and in 2024. And so when the team speaks about the areas where they believe they have opportunities, there's still opportunities just in regionalization as we continue to hone that, but I also think, in many ways, it was very useful for us to go through what was a pretty significant change we went through during the pandemic, where we doubled the size of our fulfillment center network in 18 months and built out a last mile transportation network, the size of UPS in 18 months, it was disruptive to get that optimized. But one of the things that was very useful was, it really caused us to relook at everything we were doing with fulfillment network. And we looked at it really a beginner's eye and we have found so many areas that we believe that we can evolve that I think will both help our cost to serve and even more importantly, deliver faster delivery speeds for customers. And I mentioned one area which, in particular, which you'll see us focus on over the next year or two is just, we think there are real opportunities in our inbound network and our inbound processes. And then where we locate inventory in association with that, which will accomplish both of those tasks. But for us, I don't believe that we believe that 2018 is the North Star in cost to serve. I think we believe we can keep evolving it and being better than that. Brian Olsavsky : Yes, I'd just add a couple of other items there. We've gotten a lot better at fixed cost controls, as we scale. And I think you're seeing that as part of our ability to lower cost per serve not only in operations, it's actually throughout the company. And we're seeing a reduction in some of the inflationary factors that hit us in -- especially hard in 2021 and 2022, things like transportation services, fuel and others. So not totally out of the woods there, but coming down, and we still see some more upside. On your share repurchase question, first of all, just really excited to actually have that question. No one's asked me that in three years and appreciate it. But we have come through a tumultuous period where, as Andy just said, we doubled the size of our logistics footprint and invested heavily in -- we saw that negative free cash flow, at least on our all two calculation for the period 2021 to 2022. So we're glad to see the improvement in the bounce back in free cash flow. A lot of -- and we do debate and discuss capital structure policies annually or more often. And I have nothing to announce today, but again, we primarily think we have a lot of strong investments in front of us. We're good -- we're glad to have the liquidity -- better liquidity at the end of 2023, and we're going to try to continue to build that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, you've seen very good improvement in International profitability over the last several quarters. Can you just talk about some of the levers here that you're thinking about just as you look to move into positive operating income and then how International could potentially approach North America levels over time? And then just a follow-up there. Are you seeing any shipping disruptions currently related to the Red Sea and does that factor into your outlook at all for 1Q? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : Yes. Let me start with the second one first. So we're mindful of the geopolitical issues around the world, especially as you say in the supply chain and how that might impact shipments both to the U.S. and to Europe. We're just working very hard to make that not back up on customers, and we'll continue to work that. It's not a material impact into the -- it estimated in our guidance in Q1. But again, as I said, we're vigilant on that, and we'll work to take steps where we need to, to make sure that customer experience is not impacted. On the International segment, operating income, yes, we're very pleased with the results, especially over the last few quarters. We improved operating income by $1.8 billion year-over-year. And I would attribute it to the steady progress that Andy was saying about the U.S. is, again, cost of serve down, advertising is stronger, a lot of attention to cost, a lot of attention to investments, and we are going to invest and other fixed cost control. So a lot of that is what we're seeing in the established countries of Europe and Japan. I would divide the segment a bit into a couple of buckets. First, there's that International segment, excuse me, European established country segment. And that's -- it behaves a lot like you would see in North America. If you look at the emerging countries, and again, we've launched 10 countries in the last 7 years. They're all on their own trajectory of journey to profitability and significance with customers, and we're pleased with that. I think they're all growing nicely and again, leveraging their cost structure, investing wisely and Prime benefits, but all on a curve to breakeven and then be a contributor to income and free cash flow. The other thing I'd point out is that we have advanced loaded, I would say, price benefits in our International markets. We think it's a very good source of customer acquisition and customer retention. The investment in those areas can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We had a bit of a higher spend in -- excuse me, in digital content in Q4 as we had a number of marketing and content, especially around live sports, English Premier League and Champions League in Germany and Italy, for example. But we like those benefits in those investments, different proven vehicle for customer acquisition, as I said, and it gets people shopping at our sites and engaging with benefits is always positive for the relationship with Amazon. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks. Two questions, please. I think you mentioned, Brian, that the North American margins have improved for 7 quarters in a row or something like that, a significant number. I would assume that most of the factors like rising capacity utilization given your CapEx commentary about retail, the regional center efficiencies and then overall, moderation in shipping and logistics costs, labor costs, I mean, all these factors probably mean that we'll continue to get an improvement in North American margins, but if you would comment on that.  And then secondly, on the Primetime Video -- Amazon Prime video, I know we just launched. But could you provide any color or context on expectations around that? You've got a massive number of Prime users who are coming in with a reasonable CPM with low ad load, but it seems like there should be a substantial opportunity for you. So if you want to try to size that for us or how you think about the upside, that would be really appreciated. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Sure, Mark. Thank you. I think Andy laid it out pretty well a few minutes ago on the cost structure, the regionalization, the -- growing into the assets that we added during the pandemic, great efficiency and work with productivity across really all of our operations network fixed -- attention to fixed cost and lowering costs where we can, maintaining costs where we can, the increase in advertising, success in advertising revenue growth that's outpaced our traffic growth rates. So all of those trends we expect to continue, and we're going to work hard to make sure they continue. And as we said, we have one guidepost is maybe pre-pandemic profitability, but we are working to -- we're not putting a limit on our improvement. We're going to continue to look for ways to lower the cost to serve. And I might add, at the same time, increase the customer experience because we did that -- we had that cost improvement at the same time when we at first got back to our shipping speeds from pre-pandemic and then exceeded them. So we're happy with that, and we'll continue to do both to improve the customer experience and also to lower our costs and leverage our cost structure. Yes, your second question on ads. I can't scale it right now. I mean what I would say for ads in videos is that advertisers are excited to access our Prime customer base. We are looking for ways to increase our advertising in our streaming properties, including Fire TV, but also -- and Prime Video, but also things like Freevee and Twitch.  And it's an important part of the total business model, and we expect it will allow us to have a healthy business to continue to invest in content and to continue to grow that. And we feel good about it, and the way we anticipate the ads progressing, we will not have heavy ad loads relative to see other network TV and other things. And like all of our advertising, we're trying to be useful for customers. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scott Devitt : Thanks. I have one on grocery and one on healthcare. First, on grocery, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the progress that you're making in unifying the offering between Dotcom, Fresh and Whole Foods. And as it relates to reverse logistics and using the grocery facilities, how that's lowering the cost of logistics and whether there is a significant opportunity there in terms of driving traffic and revenue in the grocery business?  Then secondly, on health care, in such a poor -- notoriously poor customer experience industry, you've made significant efforts now within acquisition and offering primary care. Just be curious if you could talk a little bit more about the longer-term vision in healthcare. Thank you. Andrew Jassy : Yes. On grocery, we're pleased with the progress we're making there. When we think about our grocery business right now and kind of, I'll call it, 3 big macro segments. The first is nonperishables where these are things like consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty products and pharmaceutical. And we -- it's a big business and it's continuing to grow at a very healthy clip, and we're really pleased with that business. And it's really the way the most mass merchandisers got into the grocery business a few decades ago. So that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We have a physical presence along with online, but Whole Foods market, which is really the pioneer and the leader in organic grocery and that's continuing to grow at a very good clip. We also made a number of changes in the business last year on the profitability side, where we really like the profitability trajectory we see there. And so again, you'll see that keep growing and expanding and feel very good about that as well. If you want to serve as many grocery needs as we do, you have to have a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been trying to do with Fresh over several years. We have tested -- we've been testing a V2 of our Fresh format in a few locations near Chicago, in a few locations in Southern California. It's very early. It's just a few months in, but the results thus far are very promising and on almost every dimension. And so we need to see it for a little bit longer time, but the results appear like we have something that's resonating. And if we continue to see that, then the issue becomes how fast and what's the best way to expand. We have also been spending increasing amounts of time and efforts here trying to make it easier for customers to be able to shop between the nonperishables and then our selection of Whole Foods as well as Fresh, I think you can expect to see that over time, both in the user experience on the app and on the website as well as how we're able to better leverage between the different business segments and their logistics capabilities, being able to get better leverage there, better economics and then allowing people to order in one conservative place to be able to pick up in multiple -- pick up for multiple types of grocery products in one place. Just seeing us already do more of that, and I think you can expect that in the future. In the healthcare space, I -- if you think about what we do on the retail side, adding a pharmacy capability is a pretty natural extension. It's something that customers had asked us for many years, and it's got more complexity to it than the rest of our retail business. So we have to think carefully about whether we wanted to pursue it, but customers so badly wanted it and the experience we thought could be better and we could be a meaningful part of changing that, that we pursued it.  And I really like the momentum that we're seeing in our Amazon Pharmacy business. It's growing really quickly. But even more important with how fast it's growing, if you've used it and you've paid attention to the customer experience over the last 12 to 15 months, it's just substantially improved from where it already was pretty good. People really love the experience. And I think that when -- the healthcare experience, particularly in the U.S. is a pretty frustrating one and not a very good one. And I think that when we tell our grandkids that the way we used to have to go get primary care was to make an appointment 3 weeks in advance and then drive 20 minutes to the doctor, park, wait in the reception for 15 minutes, get put into an exam room for 15 minutes. Doctor comes in, talks to you for 5 to 10 minutes and then you got to drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy. People are just not -- our grandkids will not believe that was the experience and it's not going to be, and you already see that changing. And its part of what attracted us in such a significant way to on medical. It's just their application, their app is so easy to use. You have all your healthcare data in one spot.  You can do chats with medical practitioners. You can do video calls, if you need to see someone, there's physical locations and lots of metropolis cities where you can get in the same day, if you need to see a specialist, they're probably into specialists and all the cities in which we operate, where you can get in a day or two later, like just it's a very different experience. Now if you actually need medication, you can get that sent to you in a day or two, either through Amazon pharmacy or other pharmacies that we work with. And that experience is so much better than what we've been accustomed to seeing. And so I think it's -- again, it's still early days. We're excited, we launched for Prime members the ability to get one medical subscription for $9 a month or $99 a year, which is 50% off, the typical price and that saw a very good take-up. So it's still early days, but we think we have an opportunity to be a meaningful part of changing that experience. And if we are helpful in changing what that primary care experience is and what it looks like to get pharmaceutical items, there's a lot of other things that we might be able to help customers with over time that whether it's wellness or whether it's diet, there's a bunch of areas that I think we can help over time. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Sebastian : Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on AWS for a moment. You outlined the generative AI stack, which I think is -- which is very clear. So I'm just curious maybe how you're going to market within the application layer given sort of the competitive dynamics of that. And then maybe expand, if you could, Andy, a little bit on the strategy for Gene AI on the consumer-facing side of the business. I know you launched Rufus today. Is that an area that you think could materially improve conversion rates and the overall consumer engagement on retail apps or what's your vision there? Thank you. Andrew Jassy : Yes. So Colin, I would say a few things on -- first on generative AI. It's -- when we talk to customers, particularly at enterprises as they're thinking about generative AI, many are still thinking through at which layers of those 3 layers of the stack, I laid out that they want to operate in. And we predict that most companies will operate in at least 2 of them. But I also think even though it may not be the case early on, I think many of the technically capable companies will operate at all 3. They will build their own models. They will leverage existing models from us, and then they're going to build the apps. And I know one of the other interesting things that we see early on right now in generative AI is that -- it's a very iterative process and real work to go from posing a question into a chat bot and getting an answer to turning that into a production quality application at the quality you need for your customer experience and your reputation and then also getting that application to work at the latency and cost characteristics that you need. And so what we see is that customers want choice. They don't want just 1 model to rule the world. They want different models for different applications. And they want to experiment with all different sized models because they yield different cost structures and different latency characteristics. And so Bedrock is really resonating with customers. They just -- they know they want to change all these variables and try and experiment and they have something that manages all those different transitions and changes so they can figure out what works best for them, especially in the first couple of years where they're learning how to build successful generative applications is incredibly important for them. So it's part of why we see Bedrock resonating so much. In the same way, what's attractive to enterprises when they think about coding companions like Q, is just if you can get 30%, 40% better productivity for your developers, which in many cases, for companies is their most scarce resource, it's a game changer. And they won't roll out every bit of code that comes from a coding companion. But if it can assist them to get 80% plus the way there quickly, that's a big deal. And one of the things that's unique about Q is it's not just a coding companion, yes, it's an expert on AWS. It will help you -- it helps you write the code, but it also helps you debug the code and it helps you test the code, helps you do transformations and it helps you figure out how a multistep implement features. There's a lot of -- helps you troubleshoot. If there's something in your application that's you write, you can find it and help you fix it. And so -- and then it also lets you look at all your data repositories, whether it's Internet or Wickes or the 40-plus data connectors like Salesforce, Alassian, and Zendesk and Slack. And let you have an intelligent conversation to get answers and take action. So it's a pretty differentiated capability there. And when enterprises are looking at how they might best make their developers more productive, they're looking at what's the array of capabilities in these different coding companion options they have.  And so we're spending a lot of time -- our enterprises are quite excited about it. It created a meaningful stir at reinvent. And what you see typically is that these companies experiment with different options they have and they make decisions for their employee base, and we're seeing very good momentum there. The question about how we're thinking about Gen AI in our consumer businesses. We're building dozens of generative AI applications across the company. It's every business that we have has multiple generative AI applications that we are building. And they're all in different stages, many of which have launched and others of which are in development.  So if you just look at our -- some of our consumer businesses, on the retail side, we built a generative AI application that allowed customers to look at summary of customer review, so that they didn't have to read hundreds and sometimes thousands of reviews to get a sense for what people like or dislike about a product. We launched a generative AI application that allows customers to quickly be able to predict what kind of fit they'd have for different apparel items. We built a generative AI application that in our fulfillment centers, that forecasts how much inventory we need in each particular fulfillment center. And so the start of the rollout of Rufus today is really just another step, but we think one that's pretty meaningful in being a generative AI powered shopping assistant and it's trained on our very expansive product catalog as well as our community Q&A and customer reviews and the broader web. But it lets customers discover items in a very different way than they have been able to on e-commerce websites. So if you want buying advice, like what should I look for in a pair of headphones or if you are doing purpose buying, like what should I buy for cold weather golf or comparisons, what's difference in lip-gloss or lip oil or you want recommendations of the best Valentine's Day gifts or you're on a detailed page with bridge product info, where you don't want to go through the whole page, you want to ask is this pickle ball rack that's good for beginners. All those questions you can pull in and get really good answers. And then it's seamlessly integrated in the Amazon experience that customers are used to and love to be able to take action. So I think that that's just the next iteration. I think it's going to meaningfully change what discovery looks like for our shopping experience and for our customers. And I could kind of step through every one of those consumer businesses. Our advertising business is building capabilities where people can submit a picture and ad copy is written and the other way around.  And you kind of think about Alexa, where we're building a very large -- expansive large language model is going to make Alexa even more productive and helpful for customer. Every one of our consumer businesses has a significant number of generative AI applications that they either have built and delivered or they're in the process of building. And I don't see that changing for many years. We have a lot of ideas. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Jassy : Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making.  Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want. For instance, in the U.S., we recently welcomed Clinique and 2 Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands.  Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our gen AI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment.  As our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the U.S. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day.  Faster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience.  One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes. As we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our cost. When we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact.  Another prominent example is our efforts to revamp our U.S. inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans.  Advertising performance remained strong, with ad sales up 24% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we're just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It's very early for streaming TV ads but we're encouraged by the early response.  Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start. And given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere.  We're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure.  And with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging gen AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.  You heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities at all 3 layers of the gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon, Trainium and Inferentia, is quite high given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives. Larger quantities of our latest generation Trainium2 is coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025. Companies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker. Our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity. Perplexity.ai trains models 40% faster than SageMaker. Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under 7 months using SageMaker. This change is how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker. The middle layer of the stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model, or LLM, customize it with their own data and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure high-quality, low-latency, cost-effective production gen AI apps. This is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand model's knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models.  Bedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair and Toyota. In the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best-performing models in the planet right now; Meta's Llama 3 models; Mistral's various models, Cohere's new models and new first-party Amazon Titan models. A week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a sneaky big launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met.  As increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality production-grade gen AI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their applications. Customers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these 2 linchpin services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing.  The top of the stack are the gen AI applications being built. And today, we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and leveraging company's internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code. It also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones. In the near future, Q will help developers transform their .NET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. Q also has a unique capability called Agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, everything from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature such as asking it to create an add to favorites feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files and suggested new functions. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan, and then the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across multiple files, code blocks and test suites. It's quite handy. On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, Internet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3 and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories and it will search all this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, engage in dialogue with customers about this data. We also introduced today a powerful new capability called Q Apps, which lets employees describe a natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data and Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data. Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors and catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, British Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slam, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q, and we've only been in beta until today.  I'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these gen AI services. It's less sexy but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening in the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS.  We expect the combination of AWS' reaccelerating growth and high demand for gen AI to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which given the way the AWS business model works is a positive sign of the future growth. The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way.  We remain very bullish on AWS. We're at $100 billion-plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And this is before you even calculate gen AI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There is a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments. Our emerging international stores are growing and moving towards profitability. Our third-party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon shipping and multichannel fulfillment continues to grow well. We just launched a Prime delivery grocery benefit that lets customers receive free unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year in Manhattan, we're launching a new smaller Whole Foods market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shops. Prime Video continues to produce compelling content, with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of a very successful Road House movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content.  Our health services business is growing robustly as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year, with customers now getting first fill medications 75% faster year-over-year nationwide. And Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial beta. There's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity. I'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple of points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate.  Second, while I typically talk about growth rates, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar, more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million or 50 basis point headwind to revenue relative to what we guided. Excluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range.  This was driven by strong operational performance across all 3 reportable segments and better-than-expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the international segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.  We remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers : selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we helped customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third-party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third-party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year-over-year.  Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates. In our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements and improved volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability.  Looking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improved profitability in our worldwide stores business while still investing to improve the customer experience. Within our fulfillment network, we are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place and we like the path we're on. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads.  Moving to AWS. Revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries as companies are shifting their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud.  Additionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish. While there always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts. AWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage.  As we've said in the past, over time, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals and making bigger commitments. It's still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q2. Net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter. Our Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the U.S. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Probably for both Andy and Brian. Historically, Amazon has shifted between periods of heavy investment and then margin expansion back into heavier investment, but you now have a much bigger base of gross profit and overall operating income. As you think about gen AI and capital intensity or grocery or Kuiper or health care, is there anything from an investment perspective that could materially impact profitability going forward in your view? Brian Olsavsky : Doug, yes, we have historically always mentioned that. You have seen like a pendulum shift sometimes between profitability and investment. I think we're at the stage now where we're doing both at the same time continually, so we are more apt to talk about the specific investments that we're making and how that might impact our short-term outlook. So if you look at the progress we've made on operating income and free cash flow over really the last 18 months, a lot of it's driven by improvements in our stores business, lower cost to serve. We've talked about regionalization efforts and how that's moving into inbound areas now.  Advertising has been growing strong and AWS has been strong. And you saw AWS margins increased 800 basis points sequentially off Q4. A lot of that's driven by cost controls and expanding revenue on the top line and lower cost structure throughout the company. We do see, though, on the CapEx side that we will be meaningfully stepping up our CapEx and the majority of that will be in our -- to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts. So I would expect that, that will increase -- it will increase depreciation, definitely in that segment.  On the -- well, we're talking about CapEx. Right now, in Q1, we had $14 billion of CapEx. We expect that to be the low quarter for the year. As Andy said earlier, we are seeing strong demand signals from our customers and longer deals and larger commitments, many with generative AI components. So those signals are giving us confidence in our expansion of capital in this area.  And as he also mentioned, we've done this for 18 years. We invest capital and resources upfront. We create capacity very carefully for our customers. And then we see the revenue, operating income and free cash flow benefit for years to come after that, with strong returns on invested capital. So a little bit of a long-winded answer to your question. But yes, we have -- the main issue that we'll see in the near term is additional CapEx and we've talked about that.  And we continue to see strong CapEx performance in our stores business. Most of that will be related to modest capital or capacity increases, in addition to our same-day fulfillment network and some Amazon Logistics upgrades to the fleet. But for the most part, what you'll see is really going to be on the AWS side. Andrew Jassy : Yes, I just would add briefly, just to summarize. I understand where the question is coming from, Doug. And I think we're in a position to do both is the short answer. I think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses in the stores business along with advertising and AWS. There's a lot of growth in front of us. And I think we're investing in a meaningful way. But I think we also -- we've been pretty consistent about don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side.  Yes, I think there are really unbelievable growth opportunities in front of us. And I think what people sometimes forget on the AWS side, it's a $100 billion revenue run rate business, that we're still 85-plus percent of the global IT spend is on premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it means we have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity, which I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure, since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet.  And unlike in the cloud where so much -- there's a lot of work to be done to move from on-premises to the cloud, people do it and they get value out of it, which is why they modernize their infrastructure. But it's work. All of this generative AI set of workloads, which will transform every experience they're going to be built from scratch on the cloud largely. And so it's just tremendous opportunities there along with some of the other areas that we're investing that are really early stage. So I think it's both for us. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Somewhat related question on CapEx intensity in AWS. So I think the CEO of Anthropic has said that I think the next generation of models cost in the neighborhood of $1 billion to train. This would be like Claude 4, I guess, high end. And then the generation after that might be as much as $10 billion to train. So is this something that you feel like the industry will do on top of AWS? Do you feel like Olympus and some of the stuff you're doing in-house needs to kind of stay at the state-of-the-art, or can others do that? And then how much did all this training have an impact on the acceleration that you saw in 1Q for AWS revenue? Andrew Jassy : Well, Ross, I would tell you that we have seen kind of 3, I'll call it, macro trends that I think are contributing to AWS' performance, at least in the last quarter. I think first of all, I think the lion's share of cost optimization is behind us. So I think companies will be smart and have learned a lot over the last number of months in how they run their infrastructure in the cloud. But I think the lion's share of the cost optimization is behind us. And I think people have moved to newer initiatives that I would, at a macro level, describe as modernizing their infrastructure and then trying to drive value at a generative AI.  On the former, I think we were on this march before the pandemic, where most companies were trying to figure out how to move from on-premises to the cloud because it's more cost-effective and it's faster to innovate and they get real developer productivity. And then when the pandemic hit and people were in survival mode and the uncertain economy, you let people save costs wherever they could, and they got distracted on that. But they're back to pursuing and figuring it out because it's low-hanging fruit for them, and we see very significant growth in that space. And at the same time, we're seeing very significant momentum in people trying to figure out how to run their generative AI on top of AWS. I mentioned we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate that we see in AI already, and it's still relatively early days. And I think that there's -- at a high level, there's a few things that we're seeing that's driving that growth. I think first of all, there are so many companies that are still building their models. And these range from the largest foundational model builders like Anthropic, you mentioned, to every 12 to 18 months or building new models. And those models consume an incredible amount of data with a lot of tokens, and they're significant to actually go train. And a lot of those are being built on top of AWS, and I expect an increasing amount of those to be built on AWS over time because our operational performance and security and as well as our chips, both what we offer from NVIDIA. But if you take Anthropic, as an example, they're training their future models on our custom silicon on Trainium. And so I think we'll have a real opportunity for a lot of those models to run on top of AWS.  I think the thing that people sometimes don't realize is that while we're in the stage that so many companies are spending money training models, once you get those models into production, which not that many companies have, but when you think about how many generative AI applications will be out there over time, most will end up being in production when you see the significant run rates. You spend much more in inference than you do in training because you train only periodically, but you're spinning out predictions and inferences all the time.  And so we also see quite a few companies that are building their generative AI applications to do inference on top of AWS. And a lot of it has to do with the services. And the primary example we see there is how many companies, tens of thousands of companies, already are building on top of Amazon Bedrock, which has the largest selection of large language models around and a set of features that make it so much easier to build a high-quality, cost-effective low latency, production-grade generative AI applications.  So we see both training and inference being really big drivers on top of AWS. And then you layer on top of that the fact that so many companies, their models and these generative AI applications are going to have their most sensitive assets and data. And it's going to matter a lot to them what kind of security they get around those applications. And yes, if you just pay attention to what's been happening over the last year or 2, not all the providers have the same track record. And we have a meaningful edge on the AWS side so that as companies are now getting into the phase of seriously experimenting and then actually deploying these applications to production, people want to run their generative AI on top of AWS. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have 2. The first one is on cost to serve. I appreciate all the color in the shareholder letter and even tonight on cost to serve. Andy, maybe could you just help us quantify a little more how to think about some of your North Star cost to serve goals over the next couple of years? And what could that mean for potential accompanying reasonable ranges of outcomes for North America retail margins through all of that? And then the second one, if cost to serve does improve, I think it should lead to significant incremental cash flow even with more CapEx. So just remind us again how you sort of think through the philosophy of returning capital to shareholders in addition to continuing to invest for the long run? Brian Olsavsky : Brian, this is Brian. I will start with your second question. So as far as dividends or buybacks or any other capital structure moves, we don't have anything to share with you on that today. But I'll reacquaint you with our general philosophy. So our first priority is to invest in -- to support the growth opportunities and long-term investments within our businesses. And generally, we still have many opportunities to put that capital to use that would generate meaningful returns, especially as you heard in generative AI. So we're very -- we have a great deal of passion on that and conviction on that as well. We are reaching a different stage of free cash flow. As you mentioned, we had negative free cash flow for 2 years, '21 and '22, immediately after the pandemic as we had doubled the size of our operations network and had a lot of other expenses. That was followed by 2023 when we had our largest -- our highest free cash flow ever. And those trends have carried into Q1. So we feel good about the free cash flow. We are, again, still anticipating higher CapEx this year.  The other thing that we're doing with cash flow right now is we're repaying some of the debt that we had taken on during that negative free cash flow period. We have reached a high watermark at the end of Q1 last year. And since then and then through this year, we'll pay that down over $25 billion. So that's our first priority as well as 2024 capital expenditures. But otherwise, nothing to share on that front.  I'll tee up, Andy, on the stores profitability because I know there's always generally the comment about how high can operating margins go and how do they compare to historic trends. And I think the same still holds. We look back to before the pandemic, and we say, first, we can achieve those operating margins even without the impact of advertising. And we're not quite there yet. But we're not limiting ourselves to that. We're looking for ways to, again, turn over every rock, look at every process and everything that we do on the logistics side and see how can we get our cost structure down and how can we get speed up and selection up. So it is working on a lot of fronts there, but cost is certainly front and center as we meet and improve customer experience. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Youssef Squali : Andy, on logistics, in September, you launched Amazon supply chain. Can you just help us understand the opportunity you see there? Where are you in that journey to build logistics as a service on a global basis? And does that require a step function increase in CapEx? Andrew Jassy : Yes. Thanks for the question, Youssef. I think that it's interesting what's happening with our -- the business we're building in third-party logistics. And it really kind of, in some ways, mirrors some of the other businesses we've gotten involved in, AWS being an example of it, even though it's -- they're very different businesses in that we realized that we had our own internal need to build a bunch of these capabilities. And we figured that there were probably others who had those same needs and we decided to build services out of them. So as our business has grown, it turns out to be pretty hard work to actually import items from overseas, get them through customs and through the border and then ship them from that point to various facilities. And then it turns out that you don't want to store those facilities in fulfillment centers because that space is really scarce. So you'd like to have them in upstream storage facilities that are very inexpensive. And then you'd like to have a way to be able to know when your more scarce supply in the fulfillment centers needs replenishment and be able to do it automatically from those upstream storage facilities. And so all of those were capabilities that we had to build for ourselves to be able to operate our stores business in the way that we wanted to and that our sellers wanted to. And so we built that capability for ourselves first and then we opened up those services as individual services to our sellers. And so we help sellers, we have a service that allows them to get items through the border and through customs. We have a service that allows them to ship from customs to various facilities, whether they're our own or their separate ones.  We allow them to store items in our upstream low-cost warehouses that they can either automatically replenish into our fulfillment centers where we ship or they can move to other facilities that they have. We have a service that lets them -- where we'll ship either to our end customers if they're selling on Amazon or to their end customers. We obviously have Buy with Prime, where we enable our Prime customers to be able to buy from our third-party Buy with Prime sellers websites, which increases their conversion 25% versus what they would do on their own, and it's a great benefit for our Prime customers.  And then I would say that supply chain with Amazon is really an abstraction on top of those individual building block services I just mentioned that makes it easier for customers to have the whole end-to-end supply chain integrated. That collective set of businesses is growing very significantly. It's already what I would consider a reasonable sized business. And I think it's just really early days. It is not something that we anticipate being a giant capital expense driver for us.  We have to build a lot of those capabilities anyway to handle our stores business, and we think we can -- it will be a modest increase on top of that to accommodate third-party sellers. But are third-party sellers find high value in us being able to manage those components for them versus having to do it themselves and they save money in the process. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : I thought I'd ask a couple of growth drivers that you mentioned. First, grocery, it seems like you're still changing the threshold for free delivery or the subscription prices. Just can you say at all how much that's contributing to your gross right now and do you think you're over the hump? Or are you optimistic this can be a really big category for you? And then maybe a little bit extra on Prime Video ramp, how that ramp went versus your expectations? And do you think that could be a meaningful contributor to ad revenues going forward? Andrew Jassy : Yes. I'll take them in opposite order just on Prime Video ads. Very early days, just launched a few months ago. It's off to a really good start. I think advertisers are excited about being able to expand their ability to advertise with us in video beyond Twitch and Freevee to Prime Video shows and movies. I think they also find that the relevancy and the measurability of that type of advertising and Prime Video ads is unique for them. So it's off to a very good start, it's early days, but we're optimistic there.  On grocery, I would tell you that we continue to be optimistic about what we're doing in grocery. We have a very large grocery business. It's kind of got a few different components. And we have a very, very significant nonperishables grocery business much the same way that the mass merchandisers entered this business 30 or 40 years ago. These are consumables and canned goods and pet food and health care and beauty products. That continues to grow at a very rapid rate. And we have an organic grocery business in Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in that space. And that business continues to grow very nicely. We're introducing a new smaller format in the fall in Manhattan and the Whole Foods Market Daily Shops idea. We've worked very hard on the profitability trajectory over the last 18 months and like the way that, that has taken shape. And then if you want to have -- do you want to serve as many grocery missions as we aim to serve. You have to have a perishables business and a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh.  We've launched our V2 format in physical stores over the last few months, primarily in Chicago and Southern California. We like the early results a lot. They're really meaningfully better in almost every dimension. It's still early, and there's some things to work through, but we like what we're seeing there. And then we have to decide the best way to roll those out over time.  And as you mentioned, Justin, we just launched a Prime benefit for grocery, which is all-you-can-eat delivery for $9.99 a month, which if you order once from Whole Foods a month, it pays for itself, or once from Amazon Fresh for orders under $40, it pays for itself. It's a very valuable offering for our Prime members, and it's off to a great start. So we have a lot -- in my opinion, we have lots of ways that we can continue to help customers satisfy their grocery needs. And we have some building blocks that I think might also change how people split up their grocery orders over time. But I continue to be optimistic that, that's going to continue to grow for us. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Ronald Josey : Maybe, Andy, I wanted to ask on international profitability, just after 1Q's 2.8% margin. Talk just about where we are in terms of international getting or to consistent profitability. We're following a similar trajectory as North America in terms of benefiting from regionalization shift, and we saw what average distance of each package traveled actually came down by 25 kilometers and whatnot. And if you could provide any insights on maybe how inbound fulfillment architecture might add to just continued benefits on faster shipping, same-day, next day, et cetera. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you, Ron. I'm going to start with this one on international profitability. So yes, in the quarter, our operating income was $902 million. And if you've watched that, we've seen a steady progression in operating income in our international segment, it's up $2.2 billion year-over-year. So we like the trend there. It breaks down into a few areas. I would say the established countries of Europe, Japan, as well as the U.K. are following a lot of the same trajectory as in the United States. They are profitable in their own right. They are adding selection, they're adding new features like grocery there, adding to their Prime benefits, and a lot of the work that we do in the United States carries over there. The second group is the emerging countries. And of course, we've launched 10 new countries in the last 7 years. Each of those has its own particular trajectory on profitability. The first thing we see there is having a good customer experience, having people sign up for Prime. A lot of times, our Prime Video benefits help with that. Then work on our cost structure as we get scale, add advertising and other things. And eventually, what we see is a breakeven -- countries breakeven and then they make positive income and free cash flow and are more of a contribution to the -- positive contribution to the international segment. So we're seeing both the emerging and the established improving, and we like the trajectory. And I think you'll see more of as we move forward. Andrew Jassy : Yes. I would add a few things. I mean, I'm again quite bullish on our international stores business. It's already a very large business. We've added a number of countries that are on the right trajectory, as Brian just indicated, and it's going to be a big, profitable business for us. And I really like the direction it's headed.  I'll take also just the second part of your question just really around continuing to take -- to work on cost structure. I'd say, first of all, on the regionalization side, which we've talked a lot about the last year, it may sound a little boring to talk about because we talked about it a lot of times. But I'd just tell you that we're not done there. A lot of the work that we've done, we still have opportunities to refine, to get more value out of that. And a lot of what we learned on the regionalization side in the U.S. was in part inspired from what we saw in Europe, which, in many ways, is set up as a regional network because of the nature of how close those countries are to one another.  And I would say we have also learned lessons from what we've done in the U.S. that we're going to be able to apply to our international operations as well. I think we see additional opportunities in all sorts of places. A good example of which is just how and where we inbound items to. The architecture we've had set up has largely had people inbounding to a couple of places. And then we took -- we spent a lot of effort and time and expense in breaking those down and shipping them to lots of other places.  And we believe we're going to be much more efficient in how we use the inbound network and how we partner with our sellers. Part of what we did with our change in seller fees, we lowered the outbound fees in a meaningful way, but then we added an incentive for our sellers to inbound into locations that allow us to be more cost following and allow both our sellers and us to enjoy in those cost savings when we're able to do so. And we're seeing very optimistic signs there, too.  I think we're still early with respect to how we can continue to optimize the number of units per box, which has all sorts of good benefits. And then I'd just also say that it's been really interesting to watch the same-day facilities evolution in our fulfillment network. And I think a lot of people have made the assumption over the last few years that faster speeds are going to mean higher cost, and that is not the case if you build the infrastructure with the right building blocks the way we have over the last couple of years. And our same-day facilities are our least expensive facilities in the network. We still have a fraction of the number of those that we will have in the U.S. that we'll have in other parts of the world, which will, again, both change our cost structure while increasing speed. So I don't think we're at the limits of what we can do. It's not going to all happen in 1 year. We're going to be working hard at this and inventing at this for several years, but I think we have a lot of upside in front of us. Dave Fildes : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, August 1s, 2024 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andy Jassy : Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $148 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $14.7 billion, up 91% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $51.4 billion, up 664% or $44.7 billion year-over-year. As I think about what matters to customers long-term and, therefore, to Amazon, there's a lot to like about what we're seeing. Starting with AWS, year-over-year revenue growth accelerated again from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. We're continuing to see three macro trends drive AWS growth. First, companies have completed the significant majority of their cost optimization efforts and are focused again on new efforts. Second, companies are spending their energy again on modernizing their infrastructure and moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. This modernization enables builders to save money, innovate at a more rapid clip, and drive productivity in most companies' scarcest resources, developers. This is the flip I've talked about in the past, where the vast majority of global IT spend today is on-premises, and we expect that to keep inverting over time. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance, and the deepest partner ecosystem, AWS continues to be customers' partner of choice and the biggest beneficiary of this flip from on-premises to the cloud. And third, builders and companies of all sizes are excited about leveraging AI. Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days, but we can see in our results and conversations with customers that our unique approach and offerings are resonating with customers. At the heart of this strategy is a firmly held belief, which we've had since the beginning of AWS, that there is not one tool to rule the world. People don't want just one database option or one analytics choice or one container type. Developers and companies not only reject it, but are suspicious of it. They want multiple options for flexibility and to use the best tool for each job to be done. The same is true in AI. You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow would be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it. The same one model or one-chip approach dominated the earliest moments of the generative AI boom, but we have a lot of data to suggest this is not what customers want here either. And our AWS team is determined to deliver choice and options for customers. You can see this philosophy in the primitive building blocks we're building at all three layers of the Gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for those building generative AI models themselves, the cost to compute for training and inference is critical, especially as models get to scale. We have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and the broadest selection of NVIDIA instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling in price performance. We're seeing significant demand for these chips. These model builders also desire services that make it much easier to manage the data, construct the models, experiment, deploy to production, and achieve high-quality performance, all while saving considerable time and money. That's what Amazon SageMaker does so well, including its most recently launched feature called HyperPods that changes the game and networking performance for large models. And we're increasingly seeing model builders standardized on SageMaker. While many teams will build their own models, lots of others will leverage somebody else's frontier model, customize it with their own data and seek a service that provides broad model selection and great generative AI capabilities. This is what we think of as the middle layer, what Amazon Bedrock does and why Bedrock has tens of thousands of companies using it already. Bedrock has the largest selection of models, the best generative AI capabilities in critical areas like model evaluation, guardrails, RAG and agenting, and then makes it easy to switch between different model types and model sizes. Bedrock has recently added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 models, which are the best performing models on the planet. Meta's new Llama 3.1 models and Mistral's new Large two models. And Lama's and Mistral's impressive performance benchmarks in open nature are quite compelling to our customers as well. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, but it does a lot more than provide code suggestions. It tests code, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors on catching security vulnerabilities and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic action. It also saves development teams time and money on the muck nobody likes to talk about. For instance, when companies decide to upgrade from one version of a framework to another, it takes development teams many months, sometimes years, burning valuable opportunity costs and churning developers who hate this tedious, though important work. With Q's code transformation capabilities, Amazon has migrated over 30,000 Java JDK applications in a few months, saving the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years compared to what it would have otherwise cost. That's a game changer. And think about how this Q transformation capability might evolve to address other elusive but highly desired migrations. During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all the other major cloud providers combined. This team is cooking, but we're not close to being done adding capabilities for our customer's usage base. For perspective, we've added over $2 billion in advertising revenue year-over-year and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. Sponsored ads drive the majority of our advertising revenue today and we see further opportunity there. Even with this growth, it's important to realize we're at the very beginning of what's possible in our video advertising. In May, we made our first appearance at the upfronts and were encouraged by the agency and advertiser feedback on the differentiated value we offer across our content, reach, signals, and ad tech. With ads and prime video, the exciting opportunity for brands is the ability to directly connect advertising that's traditionally been focused on driving awareness, as is the case for TV, to a business outcome, like product sales or subscription signups. We're able to do that through our measurement and ad tech, so brands can continually improve the relevance and performance of their ads. While ads have become the norm in streaming video, we aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. And of course, for customers preferring an ad-free experience, we offer that option for an additional $2.99 a month. In our stores business, we saw growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment and 10% year-over-year in the international segment. A few notes on our North America revenue growth rate. First, last quarter's leap day added about 100 basis points of year-over-year growth. Second, we're seeing lower average selling prices, or ASPs, right now because customers continue to trade down on price when they can. More discretionary higher ticket items, like computers or electronics or TVs, are growing faster for us than what we see elsewhere in the industry, but more slowly than we see in a more robust economy. And our continued faster delivery speed is earning us more of our customers' everyday essentials business. Third, our seller fees are a little lower than expected given the behavior changes we've seen from our latest fee changes. While some of these issues compress short-term revenue, we generally like these trends. While consumers are being careful on price, our North America unit growth is meaningfully outpacing our sales growth as our continued work on selection, low prices, and delivery is resonating. So far this year, our speed of delivery for prime customers has been faster than ever before, with more than 5 billion units arriving the same day or next day. As more customers experience our fast delivery, they look to Amazon for more of their shopping needs, and the continued acceleration of our everyday essentials business is an example of this phenomenon. On seller fees, lowering apparel fees has spurred substantial year-over-year unit growth in apparel. And the incentive we've given sellers to send their items to multiple Amazon inbound facilities so they can save money where they save us effort and money is getting more traction than we even hoped. These collective developments will benefit customers in the form of better selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speed. There's no shortage of ideas aimed in improving the experience for stores' customers. For instance, we're adding even more value to Prime, recently introducing free restaurant delivery in many of our geos, expanding Amazon's PharmacyRx pass to Medicare members. This is a benefit that gives subscribers all you can consume access to the most common generic medications for just $5 a month, and offering a grocery subscription to help save on grocery items when shopping our U.S. and UK fresh stores. As we pursue these initiatives, we remain focused on lowering our cost to serve. We have a number of opportunities to further reduce costs, including expanding our use of automation and robotics, further building out our same-day facility network, and regionalizing our inbound network. With more optimal inbound inventory placement, we expect to enable faster speeds, consolidate more orders in one box, and reduce inventory transfers once items reach a fulfillment center. These cost improvements won't happen in one quarter or one fell swoop. They take technology and process innovation with a lot of outstanding execution, but we see a path to continuing to lower our cost to serve, which as we've discussed in the past, has very meaningful value for customers in our business. As we lower our cost to serve, we can add more low ASP selection that we can support economically, which coupled with our fast delivery, puts Amazon in the consideration set for increasingly more shopping needs for customers. A few other comments about areas in which we're investing. We remain very bullish on the medium to long-term impact of AI in every business we know and can imagine. The progress may not be one straight line for companies. Generative AI especially is quite iterative, and companies have to build muscle around the best way to solve actual customer problems. But we see so much potential to change customer experiences. We see it in how our generative AI-powered shopping assistant Rufus is helping customers make better shopping decisions. We see it in how our AI features that allow customers to simulate trying apparel items or changing the buying experience. We see it in how our generative AI listing tool is enabling sellers to create new selection with a line or two of text versus the many forms previously required. We see it in our fulfillment centers across North America where we're rolling out Project Private Investigator, which uses a combination of generative AI and computer vision to uncover defects before products reach customers. We see it in how our generative AI is helping our customers discover new music and video. We see it in how it's making Alexa smarter. And we see it in how our custom silicon and services like SageMaker and Bedrock are helping both our internal teams and many thousands of external companies reinvent their customer experiences and businesses. We are investing a lot across the board in AI, and we'll keep doing so as we like what we're seeing and what we see ahead of us. We also continue to like the progress in Prime Video. Our storytelling is resonating with our hundreds of millions of monthly viewers worldwide, and the 62 Emmy nominations Amazon MGM Studios recently received is another supporting data point. We recently debuted titles like Fallout, the second most watched original title ever for Prime Video, The Idea of You, which attracted nearly 50 million viewers worldwide in the first two weeks on Prime Video, and Season 4, The Boys, which reached number one on Prime Video in 165 countries in its opening two weeks. And we continue to see momentum in live sports. We recently announced 11-year landmark deals with the NBA and the WNBA. When combined with our original films and shows, partner streaming services, licensed content, and rent or buy titles, Prime Video continues to evolve into the best destination for streaming video. And for Project Kuiper, our low-Earth orbit satellite constellation, we're accelerating satellite manufacturing at our facility in Kirkland, Washington. We've announced a distribution agreement with Vrio, who distributes direct TV Latin America and Sky Brazil to offer Project Kuiper's satellite broadband network to residential customers across seven countries in South America, and we continue to feel significant demand for the service from enterprise and government entities. We expect to start shipping production satellites late this year and continue to believe this could be a very large business for us. I could go on, but we'll stop here. There's a lot to feel optimistic about over the next several years and the team collectively remains focused on continuing to invent and deliver for our customers in the business. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $148 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange in the quarter, which is about $300 million higher than we'd anticipated in our Q2 guidance range. Worldwide operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $14.7 billion, which was $700 million above the high end of our guidance range. Across all of our segments, we remain focused on managing costs in a way that allows us to continue innovating and investing in areas that we think could move the needle for our customers. Starting with the North American international segments, customers continue to respond positively to our focus on low prices, broad selection, and fast shipping offers. We delivered at our fastest speeds ever so far this year, which helps drive strength in areas like our everyday essentials. These include items like non-perishable foods, as well as health, beauty, and personal care items. And Prime members continue to increase their shopping frequency while growing their spend on Amazon. Overall unit sales grew 11% year-over-year, which is consistent with our growth rates in Q1 after you adjust for the approximately 100 basis point impact of leap year. North America segment revenue was $90 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. And international segment revenue was $31.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. North America segment operating income was $5.1 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and down 20 basis points quarter over quarter. If we look at profitability of the core North America stores business, we actually improved our margin again quarter-over-quarter in Q2. The overall North America segment operating margin decreased slightly due to increased Q2 spend in some of our investment areas, including Kuiper, where we're starting to manufacture satellites we'll launch into space in Q4. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, driven by our efforts to place inventory more regionally, closer to where our customers are. This resulted in more consolidated shipments, with higher units per box shipped. We also saw packages traveling shorter distances to customers, and this also led to better on-road productivity in our transportation network. Our international segment was profitable again in Q2, with operating income of $300 million, an improvement of $1.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 0.9%, up 390 basis points year over year. This increase is primarily driven by our established countries, as we improve our cost structure with better inventory placement and more consolidated shipments. Additionally, our emerging countries continue to expand their customer offerings, leverage their cost structure, and invest in expanding prime benefits. We are pleased with the overall progress of these countries as they make strides on their respective paths to profitability. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments, and we saw strong growth on an increasing larger revenue base this quarter. We continue to see opportunities that further expand our offering in areas that are driving growth today, like sponsored products, as well as newer areas, like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue is $26.3 billion, an increase of 18.8% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105 billion. During the second quarter, we saw continued growth across both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads. We saw companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premises to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $4 billion year-over-year. It's driven by our continued focus on cost control, including a measured pace of hiring. Additionally, AWS operating margin includes an approximately 200 basis point favorable impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers that we instituted in Q1. As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI. Now let's turn our attention to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the first half of the year, CapEx was $30.5 billion. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we expect capital investments to be higher in the second half of the year. The majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads. For the third quarter, specifically, I'd highlight a few seasonal factors to keep in mind. First, we hosted another successful Prime Day in mid-July. It was our 10th Prime Day and was our largest ever. Prime members globally saved billions of dollars on deals across every product category. From a profitability perspective, we've historically seen a headwind to operating margin in Q3, driven by Prime Day deals, as well as the marketing spend surrounding the event. Additionally, in Q3, we also begin to ramp up our capacity to handle Q4 holiday volumes in our fulfillment network. And lastly, we expect an increase in digital content cost quarter-over-quarter from the return of our NFL Thursday Night Football. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator : At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question and thanks for all the detail and the prepared remarks. Maybe a two-parter on AWS. There's been a theme during the last couple of weeks of earnings of the potential to over-invest as opposed to under-invest in AI as a broad theme. I'm curious, Andy, if you have a perspective on that in terms of thinking about elements of capitalizing on the theme longer term against the potential for pace or cadence of investment on AWS as a segment. And the second part would be coming back to your comments on custom silicon. How do you feel about custom silicon, both from a pace of investment and then more broadly, how you think about it as a return profile on a pivot to more custom silicon in your portfolio over the medium to long term? Thanks so much. Andy Jassy : Thanks, Eric. I'll take them in order. I think on the question about investment in AWS and on the AI side, I think where I'd start is, I think one of the least understood parts about AWS over the last 18 years has been what a massive logistics challenge it is to run that business. If you think about the fact that we have about 35 regions and think of a region as multiple -- a cluster of multiple data centers and about 110 availability zones, which is roughly equivalent to a data center, sometimes it includes multiple. And then if you think about having to land thousands and thousands of SKUs across the 200 AWS services in each of those availability zones at the right quantities, it's quite difficult. And if you end up actually with too little capacity, then you have service disruptions, which really nobody does because it means companies can't scale their applications. So most companies deliver more capacity than they need. However, if you actually deliver too much capacity, the economics are pretty woeful and you don't like the returns of the operating income. And I think you can tell from having -- we disclosed both our revenue and our operating income in AWS that we've learned over time to manage this reasonably well. And we have built models over a long period of time that are algorithmic and sophisticated that land the right amount of capacity. And we've done the same thing on the AI side. Now AI is newer. And it's true that people take down clumps of capacity in AI that are different sometimes. I mean -- but it's also true that it's not like a company shows up to do a training cluster asking for a few hundred thousand chips the same day? Like you have a very significant advance signal when you have customers that want to take down a lot of capacity. So while the models are more fluent, it's also true that we've built, I think, a lot of muscle and skill over time in building these capacity signals and models. And we also are getting a lot of signal from customers on what they need. I think that it's -- the reality right now is that while we're investing a significant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today. I mean we have a lot of demand right now. And I think it's going to be a very, very large business for us. On the custom silicon point, yeah, it's really interesting what's happened here. And it's also -- our strategy and approach here has been informed by running AWS for 18 years. When we started AWS, we had and still have a very deep partnership with Intel on the generalized CPU space. But what we found from customers is that they -- when you find a -- an offering that is really high value for you and high return, you don't actually spend less, even though you're spending less per unit, you spend less per unit, but it enables you and free you up to do so much more inventing and building for your customers. And then when you're spending more, you actually want better price performance than what you're getting. And a lot of times, it's hard to get that price performance from existing players unless you decide to optimize yourself for what you're learning from your customers and you push that envelope yourself. And so we built custom silicon in the generalized CPU space with Graviton, which we're on our fourth model right now. And that has been very successful for customers and for our AWS business is it saves customers about -- up to about 30% to 40% price performance versus the other leading x86 processors that they could use. And we saw the same trend happening about five years ago in the accelerator space in the GPU space, where the products are good, but there was really primarily one provider and supply was more scarce than what people wanted. And people -- our customers really want improved price performance all the time. And so that's why we went about building Trainium, which is our training chip and Inferentia, which is our inference chip, which we're on second versions of both of those, they will have very compelling relative price performance and in a world where it's hard to get GPUs today, the supply is scarce and all the schedules continue to move over time. Customers are quite excited and demanding at a high clip. Our custom silicon, and we're producing it as fast as we can. I think that's going to have very good return profile just like Graviton has and I think it will be another differentiating feature around AWS relative to others. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for the questions. I have two. So the first one I wanted to ask about in the second quarter, the retail gross margins that we're trying to do the monkey math, look a little weaker than expected. Was there any extra pressure on retail gross margins because of discounting? Or is that where Kuiper is? Or sort of how do we think about some of the drivers of retail gross margins in the quarter at shipping? And the second one, Andy, in the past, you talked about cost to serve improvement and sort of getting the North America margins back to pre-pandemic levels. Can you just remind us again sort of the internal philosophy about executing on that? Is there a time line to deliver on that? Sort of how are you sort of balancing showing that profitability improvement over the next couple of years versus pressing on new investments like Kuiper and perhaps reinvesting some of those profits over the next couple of years? Andy Jassy : Brian, let me start with the first question on North America margins. So if you look at the segment operating margins, we did decrease 20 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. I'll remind you that we have - see the annual step-up in stock-based compensation at the end of Q1 each year, and that added about $1.8 billion of stock-based comp expense in Q2 versus Q1. So that's impacting to some extent, all three segments. But even with that stock-based comp step up, the stores part of the North America segment, increase the margin again last quarter. So we're continuing to see strong improvements in cost to serve as well as improvement in speed, added selection, better safety. So a lot of the key areas that we're hitting on are strong. What you're seeing for the segment is that some of our investment areas had a tick up in expenses and investment in Q2 versus Q1. And that's not unheard of. Q1 is usually the lightest investment quarter, things like Prime Video and devices have less investment going on in those quarters. But the one thing I'd point out, I think we mentioned it is Kuiper stepping up a bit in Q2 versus Q1 as we start to build satellites that we'll launch in Q3 and Q4 this year. And your second question, Brian, I continue and the team continues to believe that we have the opportunity to expand the margin in our stores business. And as I've said on a number of the calls that we've done, it's not going to happen in one quarter, it's not going to happen in one fell swoop, it's going to take work over a long period of time. But I think that one of the silver linings, if you will, about year and half ago in the ricochet of the pandemic and all the growth that we had and the cost to serve challenges that we had was, it really forced us to reevaluate everything in the network. And really, even our most closely felt beliefs over a long period of time. And what it did was unveiled a number of opportunities that we believe we have to keep driving cost to serve down. And the first one that you've seen play out over the last year or so has been the regionalization of the U.S. network. And I think one thing to remember about that is that while it's had even bigger impact than maybe we theorized when we first architected it, we're still not done fully honing it. There's a lot of ways that we continue to optimize that U.S. regionalization that we think will continue to bear lower cost to serve. But at the same time, we found a number of other areas where we believe we can take our cost down while also improving the customer experience. One of the great things about regionalization was it not only took our cost to serve down, but it meaningfully changed the speed with which we're able to get items to customers. And so we have a number of those other opportunities. Another example of that is regionalizing our inbound network, which is also going to lower our cost to serve and get items more close to end users and diminish the amount of time it takes to get them to customers. We have a number of things that we're working on that allow us to combine more units per box, which lowers our costs as well and a lot of customers like that better because it's better for the environment, having more units per box. So I think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to take down our cost to serve. And strategically and philosophically, just two other things as you were alluding to that question. I think that from our perspective, as we're able to take cost to serve down, it means that we're able to afford to have more selection that we're able to offer to customers. And there are a lot of lower ASP items there, average selling price items that we don't stock because they're not economic to stock with our current cost to serve. But as we work hard to make progress like we are on lowering our cost to serve, that allows us to add more selection. And we see this time in and time out that we -- when we add more selection, customers actually consider us for more of their purchases and spend more with us down the line. I think the other thing, too, I would tell you is that I don't see it as being binary in any way, nor have I really ever seen it this way in the history of the company. I've been here 27 years. But we don't think of it as we can either be investing or we can be working on trying to take our cost to serve down. We believe we can do both. If you think about the examples you gave, the stores business and the Kuiper business are -- they're just different people working on those businesses. So our stores team is going to continue to work really hard on expanding selection and keeping prices low and speeding up our delivery times and driving our cost to serve down while our Kuiper team is working on how to figure out how to help the 400 million to 500 million households around the world who don't have broadband connectivity get that connectivity and allow them to do a lot of the things we take for granted today with broadband connectivity. So they're not going to be binary. We're going to work on them both at the same time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : Hey, thanks so much. Two questions. AWS, those three factors that are causing that kind of acceleration in Q2 and recovery in growth rates from a year ago, those sound sustainable? Is there any reason that we shouldn't see sort of ongoing acceleration at some level through the back half of the year? And secondly, I just want to ask about a small segment of pharmacy. It seems to me like at least anecdotally I seem to lean more into marketing for that and survey work suggests to us that there's kind of greater consumer interest in that. Just talk about where that business is for you? And is it at a point where you feel like you move beyond early adoption and are leaning into kind of getting more mass Amazon customer adoption? Thank you. Andy Jassy : On the AWS question, it's always hard to predict what the growth rates are going to be, and it's a relatively large business at $105 billion revenue run rate at this point. But I do think that we have seen the lion's share of the cost optimization happen. And I also do believe that pre-pandemic, we were on this March where most companies are trying to figure out how to modernize their infrastructure, which really means moving from on-premises to the cloud because they can save money and invent that more quickly and get better developer productivity. And then the pandemic happen and people were in survival mode and then a difficult economy came and people are trying to save money. And we just see people going back to asking themselves, why aren't we taking this low hanging fruit here. I mean it makes -- I don't want to run my own data centers. I can actually be more cost-effective and invent more quickly from my customers if I'm using the cloud. And AWS with just a lot more functionality, stronger operational performance and security, which really matters to customers as well and a deeper partner ecosystem continues to be the partner of choice as people are moving to the cloud. And I think the generative AI component is in its very early days. It's -- as I said, we kind of sometimes look at it and say that it's interesting that we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already in AI, and it's so early. But if we look at the amount of demand that we have from customers right now, it's very significant. So I think all three of those things have a chance and will likely continue over time. And we'll see where that growth rate nets out over the next number of years. I think that -- the one other thing I would say about that, too, Mark, is that -- the business today, as I mentioned, it's a $105 billion revenue run rate business, about 90% of the global IT spend is still on premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do, there's a lot of growth ahead of us in AWS as the leader in all those dimensions I mentioned. But I also think that generative AI itself and AI as a whole it's going to be really large. I mean it is not something that we originally factored when we were thinking about how large AWS could be and unlike the non-AI space, where you're basically taking all of this infrastructure that's been built on premises over a long period of time and working with customers to help them migrate it to the cloud, which is a lot of work, by the way. In the generative AI space, it's going to get big fast and it's largely all going to be built from the get-go in the cloud, which allows the opportunity for those businesses to continue to grow. On the pharmacy side, I think you're right that you're seeing that business continue to grow and to get more resonance with customers. And I think it was always a relatively natural extension for us to build a pharmacy offering from our retail business. But I think a lot of what you see in the business has grown really quickly, a lot of what you've seen is that the work that the team has done on the customer experience over the last 18 months has really paid off. Customers love the customer experience of Amazon Pharmacy. And especially, by the way, when you think about the experience and the speed and ease with which you can order versus walking into a pharmacy in a physical store, if you walk into pharmacies and -- in cities today, it's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you and a lot of shop lifting going on in the stores. So the combination of what's happening in the physical world and how much improved we've made our pharmacy experience is driving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior. I think also you see us continuing to expand there. We expanded our RxPass package and program to Medicare members, that program allows customers and members to be -- Prime members to be able to get up to 60 common medications for just $5 a month. And we continue to launch same-day delivery of medications to cities. We have them in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York today with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year. So we're seeing a lot of growth there, and we're very optimistic about it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brent Thill : On AWS, I'm curious if you had a backlog number you could share for the quarter. And I guess, Andy, when you think about getting the data state ready, I know AI today is early, but when you see most of these companies are having to move to public cloud, are you seeing a step-up in return to workloads moving to get ready for this day to stay even if they're not ready to adopt AI? What are you seeing in those sales motions? Thank you. Dave Fildes : This is Dave. I'll just start off just to give you the backlog figure. So at the end of the second quarter, it was $156.6 billion. So that's up about 19% year-over-year. Andy Jassy : On the second part of your question, Brent, what I would say is that it's true in analytics, but it's even maybe more so true in AI, which is that it's quite difficult to be able to do AI effectively if your data is not organized in such a way that you can access that data and run the models on top of them and then build the application. So when we work with customers, and this is true both when we work directly with customers as well as when we work with systems integrator partners, everyone is in a hurry to get going on doing generative AI and one of the first questions that we ask is show us where your data is, show us what your data lake looks like, show us how you're going to access that data. And there's very often work associated with getting your data in the right shape and in the right spot to be able to do generative AI. Fortunately, because so many companies have done the work to move to the cloud, there's a number of companies who are ready to take advantage of AI, and that's where we've seen a lot of the growth. But also it's worth remembering that again, remember the 90% of the global IT spend being on premises, there are a lot of companies who have yet to move to a cloud, who will, and the ability to use AI more effectively is going to be one of the many drivers in doing so for them. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. John Blackledge : Great. Two questions. First, the AWS op income margins were strong, again, mid-30% area. Just kind of what were the key drivers? And how should we think about AWS margins in the back half of the year? And then the international op income margin stepped down a bit Q-over-Q. Just curious about that. Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah. Thank you, John. Let me start with AWS profitability. So yes, the margin is in the mid-30% range in Q2. It's up from the mid-20% range last year. So you're seeing the impact of a number of cost reductions that we've made and efficiencies we've driven in the business. There's also an adjustment that we made to the useful life of servers that happened in Q1. Talked about last quarter, that contributed about 200 basis points of margin year-over-year. So we continue to work on the cost structure. But again, as we've said in the past, these operating margin will fluctuate and be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We are -- continue to work to build new products that attract new customers and work on our efficiencies. Second question was? John Blackledge : International segment margin. Dave Fildes : Yeah, this is Dave. Just real quick on that. You mentioned we're about $300 million profit for the quarter. That is up about 390 basis points year-on-year from a margin perspective. And as we talked about in the past, there's a number of countries that different stages of existence and maturity there. And so I think you're seeing continued progress, certainly on a year-over-year basis with both our established countries. So the UK, Germany and Japan in particular, being sizable contributors to that business, continued improvement and build out there, similar to the factors we talked about with the U.S., focused on operational efficiency while expanding the customer experience. And then in the emerging countries, as we've said over the past several quarters, we launched about 10 countries over the last seven years really focused on, again, expanding that customer experience, building out the Prime member benefits while building scalable solutions for customers. And so I think in both that established and emerging areas, seeing good progress year-over-year in working for further improvement there. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. You factored in some macro indiscretionary pressures into your 2Q guide, especially in Europe, and I think you called out computers, electronics and maybe TVs in 2Q as well. I\u2019m just curious, were the macro trends generally as you expected? Or did you see softening through the quarter? And kind of how does that influence your 3Q outlook? And then separately, Brian, can you help us quantify the incremental investment around Kuiper that you talked about? Thank you. Brian Olsavsky : Yeah, sure. Thank you, Doug. The macro factors, if I step back, I think Andy discussed it earlier as well. We're seeing a lot of the same consumer trends that we have been talking about for the last year. Consumers being careful with their spend, trading down, looking for lower ASP products, looking for deals. That continued into Q2, and we expect it to continue into Q3. We're seeing signs of it continuing in Q3. The difference in Q2 was that, again, we had very strong unit volume growth. We actually slightly accelerated when you adjust for leap year in North America unit growth in Q2. So the drop in revenue sequentially -- revenue growth sequentially was tied to ASP and both continuation of existing trends, but also as we talked about growth in our everyday essentials business and categories. So while we think we are selling a number of higher ticket items, certainly and holding up well in the market itself, certainly not as strong as it's been in a normalized economy. And -- so it's -- lower ASP products are more of the mix right now. And we like that because, again, our speed allows us to deliver, especially everyday essentials, quickly, and we'd like to be in the consideration set for consumers on those items. We're not going to quantify Kuiper today, but thank you for your question. Dave Fildes : And thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Dave Fildes : Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 31, 2024 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andy Jassy : Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $158.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, up 56% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $46.1 billion, up 128% or $25.9 billion year-over-year. As always, we're focused on making our customers' lives better and easier and thinking long term with respect to how we can keep helping customers and build a successful business to outlast all of us. In our stores business, we saw sales growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment and 12% year-over-year in the international segment. Our team continues to focus on the inputs that matter most to customers, really broad selection, low prices, fast and free delivery, and a range of compelling Prime member benefits, including our recent additions of unlimited grocery delivery from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and local third-party grocery partners for $9.99 a month and fuel savings of $0.10 a gallon at bp, Amoco, and ampm stations in the US. At a time when consumers are being careful about how much they spend, we're continuing to lower prices and ship even more quickly, and we can see this resonating with customers as our unit growth continues to be strong and outpace even our revenue growth. In the last few months, we've hosted our largest and most successful Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days ever and helped customers save over $5 billion across more than 50 million deals. And for the second year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally. We also continue to focus on lowering our cost to serve and are pursuing several initiatives that we believe will have meaningful long-term impact in this area. First, we continue to believe there are more gains on top of what we've captured thus far in outbound regionalization and getting more items closer to end consumers. As such, we're in the process of significantly changing the way we inbound items into our fulfillment network and subsequently spread them to our regional fulfillment nodes. In the last few months, we've made hundreds of changes to our US inbound network and opened more than 15 inbound buildings. While still relatively early in this re-architecture, we've already improved our ability to spread inventory across our fulfillment centers by 25% year-over-year, allowing us to have more of the requisite items in fulfillment centers closest to the customer, so we can compile shipments and ship to customers even more quickly. As we scale and optimize this new design, we expect these changes will further improve inventory placement, offer faster delivery time, save transportation costs, and enable us to increase units shipped per box. Second, we continue to roll out same-day delivery facilities, which is not only the fastest way to get products to customers but also one of our lowest cost ways to deliver. Over 40 million customers this past quarter have had their orders delivered for free with same-day delivery, an increase of more than 25% year-over-year. And third, we continue to innovate in robotics to speed delivery, lower cost to serve, and further improve safety in our fulfillment network. We recently launched our 12th-generation fulfillment center design with the first building launching in Shreveport, Louisiana. This is the first facility that incorporates our newest robotics inventions that simplify stowing, picking, packing, and shipping processes. Thus far, this new design reduces fulfillment processing time by up to 25%, increases the number of items we can offer for same-day or next-day delivery and is expected to drive a 25% improvement in our cost to serve during peak within this next generation facility. Though we believe we have more expansive automation and robotics than other retail peers, it's still early days in how much automation we expect in our fulfillment network. In advertising, we remain pleased with our progress, generating $14.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, 18.8% year-over-year growth. Our expansive reach, ability to service relevant offers to our customers, opportunity to engage customers from the top of the funnel to point of purchase, and leading capabilities around measuring outcomes at every touch point provide all types of brands with full funnel advertising at scale. With sponsored products, we're seeing meaningful growth on a very large base, and we see further opportunity in driving even better performance for advertisers by further improving the relevancy of the ads we show and by providing additional optimization controls. At the same time, some of our newer offerings are in their very early days. We're just entering our first broadcast season for Prime Video advertising, following a very strong showing at upfronts. And we're continuing to support brands of all sizes with our Generative AI-powered creative tools across display, video and audio, including our video generator that uses a single product image to curate custom AI-generated videos. While we're generating a lot of advertising revenue today, there remains considerable upside. AWS grew 19.1% year-over-year and now stands at a $110 billion annualized run rate. We've seen significant reacceleration of AWS growth for the last four quarters. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance and the deepest partner community, AWS continues to be a customer's partner of choice. There are signs of this in every part of AWS's business. We see more enterprises growing their footprint in the cloud, evidenced in part by recent customer deals with the ANZ Banking Group, Booking.com, Capital One, Fast Retailing, Ita\u00fa Unibanco, National Australia Bank, Sony, T-Mobile, and Toyota. You can look at our partnership with NVIDIA called Project Ceiba, where NVIDIA has chosen AWS's infrastructure for its R&D supercomputer due in part to AWS's leading operational performance and security. And you can see how AWS continues to innovate in its infrastructure capabilities. With deliveries like Aurora Limitless Database, which extends AWS's very successful relational database to support millions of database writes per second and manage petabytes of data whilst maintaining the simplicity of operating a single database or with our custom Graviton4 CPU instances, which provide up to nearly 40% better price performance versus other leading x86 processors. Companies are focused on new efforts again, spending energy on modernizing their infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. This modernization enables companies to save money, innovate more quickly, and get more productivity from their scarce engineering resources. However, it also allows them to organize their data in the right architecture and environment to do Generative AI at scale. It's much harder to be successful and competitive in Generative AI if your data is not in the cloud. The AWS team continues to make rapid progress in delivering AI capabilities for customers in building a substantial AI business. In the last 18 months, AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and GenAI features as the other leading cloud providers combined. AWS's AI business is a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate business that continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and is growing more than 3 times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly. We talk about our AI offering as three macro layers of the stack, with each layer being a giant opportunity and each is progressing rapidly. At the bottom layer, which is for model builders, we were the first major cloud provider to offer NVIDIA's H200 GPUs through our EC2 P5e instances. And thanks to our networking innovations like Elastic Fabric adapter and Nitro, we continue to offer advantaged networking performance. And while we have a deep partnership with NVIDIA, we've also heard from customers that they want better price performance on their AI workloads. As customers approach higher scale in their implementations, they realize quickly that AI can get costly. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The second version of Trainium, Trainium2 is starting to ramp up in the next few weeks and will be very compelling for customers on price performance. We're seeing significant interest in these chips, and we've gone back to our manufacturing partners multiple times to produce much more than we'd originally planned. We also continue to see increasingly more model builders standardize an Amazon SageMaker, our service that makes it much easier to manage your AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy to production. This team continues to add features at a rapid clip punctuated by SageMaker's unique hyperpod capability, which automatically splits training workloads across more than 1,000 AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40%. At the middle layer where teams want to leverage an existing foundation model customized with their data and then have features to deploy high-quality Generative AI applications, Amazon Bedrock has the broadest selection of leading foundation models and most compelling modules for key capabilities like model valuation, guardrails, rag and agents. Recently, we've added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, Meta's Llama 3.2 models, Mistral's Large 2 models and multiple stability AI models. We also continue to see teams use multiple model types from different model providers and multiple model sizes in the same application. There's mucking orchestration required to make this happen. And part of what makes Bedrock so appealing to customers and why it has so much traction is that Bedrock makes this much easier. Customers have many other requests, access to even more models, making prompt management easier, further optimizing inference costs, and our Bedrock team is hard at work making this happen. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable Generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest reported code acceptance rates in the industry for multiline code suggestions. The team has added all sorts of capabilities in the last few months, but the very practical use case recently shared where Q Transform saved Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK as excited developers and prompted them to ask how else we could help them with tedious and painful transformations. Spend a few minutes reading developer forums about what they wish they could move away from, and you'll get an idea of what they want. Expect more practical AI game changers from Q. We're also using Generative AI pervasively across Amazon's other businesses with hundreds of apps in development or launched. For consumers, we've expanded Rufus, our Generative AI-powered expert shopping assistant to the UK, India, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada. And in the US, we've added more personalization, the ability to better narrow customer intent and real-time pricing and deal information. We've recently debuted AI Shopping Guides for consumers, which simplifies product research by using Generative AI to pair key factors to consider in a product category with Amazon's wide selection, making it easier for customers to find the right product for their needs. For sellers, we've recently launched Project Amelia, an AI system that offers tailored business insights to boost productivity and drive seller growth. We continue to rearchitect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models that we'll share with customers in the near future, and we're increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices. Take the new Kindle Scribe we just announced. The note-taking experience is much more powerful with the new built-in AI-powered notebook, which enables you to quickly summarize pages of notes into concise bullets in a script font that can easily be shared. Speaking of Kindle products, we just launched a completely new Kindle lineup, the first time we've done a portfolio refresh of this size. Apart from the Scribe, it includes the first-ever color Kindle, the fastest Kindle Paperwhite ever and a new pocket-sized Kindle. The early sales for these devices have significantly outperformed our expectations, and Kindle is having an excellent year with customers reading more than ever. We now have over 20 billion average monthly pages read on Kindle devices worldwide. There are so many things we're energized by right now, but we'll quickly mention one more, the progress we're making in improving customers' pharmacy experience. Brick-and-mortar pharmacies account for just over 90% of prescriptions dispensed in the US that require customers to make trips to forlorn physical venues with much of the selection behind locked shelves, waiting lines for meds and only finding out about pricing at the point of purchase. The largest mail order pharmacies offer delivery in 5 to 10 business days. We think customers deserve better. Today, we can deliver to 95% of first-time Amazon Pharmacy customers in the US within two business days and to 20% of US Prime members within 24 hours. Next year, we plan to launch operations in 20 new cities, so nearly half the US will have the ability to have their medications delivered to their door within hours. We believe making it easier for customers to get their medications will improve medication adherence, which we know can directly improve health outcomes. Across Amazon, we have a lot coming in the next few months. We eagerly look forward to sharing these with customers, and a big thank you to my Amazon teammates around the world for all their hard work. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $158.9 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year, excluding a 20 basis point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. As a reminder, our Q3 guidance had anticipated a larger unfavorable impact of approximately 90 basis points. Worldwide operating income increased 56% year-over-year to $17.4 billion, our highest quarterly operating income ever and was $2.4 billion above the high end of our guidance range. We remain focused on streamlining and managing costs in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. In the third quarter, North America segment revenue was $95.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $35.9 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Worldwide paid units accelerated to 12% growth year-over-year as our customers continue to come to Amazon for low prices, broad selection and convenient fast delivery. Prime remains a core contributor to this growth. Year-over-year paid membership growth accelerated in Q3 from both the US and globally, helped by our tenth annual Prime Day event in mid-July. Customers are enjoying even faster delivery speeds, which also helps drive strong growth in items like everyday essentials. This includes items like health, beauty, and personal care as well as nonperishable grocery. Though all these items often have a lower average selling price, the strength in everyday essential's revenue is a positive indicator that customers are turning to us for more of their daily needs. We see that when customers purchase these types of items from us, they build bigger baskets, shop more frequently and spend more on Amazon. We remain focused on keeping prices sharp and offering broad selection that gives customers options when making purchase decisions. Shifting to profitability. Our North America and international segments each delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. North America segment operating income was $5.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion year-over-year. North America operating margin was 5.9%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, we continue to make progress in improving our fulfillment network cost structure, driven in part by improved inventory placement. This helped us drive better productivity in our transportation network and shipping efficiency from higher units per box. In the international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion year-over-year. International operating margin was 3.6%, up 390 basis points year-over-year. So far this year, we've generated operating profit in each of the three quarters for the international segment and totals $2.5 billion year-to-date. We're seeing strength in our established countries like the UK and Germany as we continue to drive efficiencies to improve on-road productivity in our transportation network and better execution in our fulfillment centers. Our emerging countries are growing revenue at a healthy rate also, and they are leveraging their cost structures on investing strategically in Prime benefits. We have confidence that our focus on the inputs, coupled with the strength of our global teams, will continue to drive improvement over time. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong growth on an increasing large base of advertising revenue. We see many opportunities to further expand our ads offering in areas that are driving growth today like Sponsored Products as well as more recent growth areas like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $27.5 billion, an increase of 19.1% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $110 billion. The business continues to grow, mostly opportunity to expand our core cloud offering and our AI services. Customers increasingly recognize that to get the true benefit of Generative AI, they also need to move to the cloud. AWS operating income was $10.4 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on cost control, including a measured pace of hiring, a focus on driving efficiencies in our infrastructure, and reducing costs across the business. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year-over-year in Q3. As we said in the past, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash CapEx plus equipment finance leases. Year-to-date capital investments were $51.9 billion. We expect to spend approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2024. The majority of the spend is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services while also including technology infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve. This includes investments in same-day delivery facilities, in our inbound network and as well in robotics and automation. We're encouraged by the start of the holiday season, which kicked off in October with a strong Prime Big Deal Days. We are ready to serve customers throughout the season, and I want to thank our teams across Amazon for delivering two very large Prime member events in the past four months and for getting us ready to delight customers during this holiday season. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug Anmuth : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Brian, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of the 38% AWS margins. I know you mentioned the 200 basis points related to the useful lives push-out, but just how to think about sustainability kind of in the 30s there going forward? And then perhaps related the step-up in CapEx that you saw in 3Q, you gave the full-year number, which was helpful. Any kind of early read or thoughts on how we should think about 2025? Thanks so much. Brian Olsavsky : Okay. Thanks, Doug. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, the primary drivers of the year-over-year margin increase are threefold. So first is accelerating top-line demand. That helps with all of our efficiencies, our cost-control efforts and of course, what you just mentioned, I believe, the change in the useful life of our servers this year. Let me remind you on that one. We made the change in 2024 to extend the useful life of our servers. This added about 200 basis-points of margin year-over-year. On cost-control, it's been a number of areas. It's -- first is hiring and staffing. We're being very measured in our hiring and you can tell as a company where our office staff is down slightly year-over-year and it's flat to the end of last year. So we're really working hard to maintain our efficiencies not only in the sales force and other areas and production teams, but also in our infrastructure areas. Infrastructure is a big part of our cost structure in AWS and we're probably the best at matching up supply and demand and driving cost efficiencies and driving those operations very, very strongly. And I think you saw that this quarter, especially on the higher-volume. And over-time, this margin will fluctuate in the segment. It's a number of factors to keep in mind, including our level of investment in the amount of innovation and product development we're doing for new products and services, changes in our staffing for sales and support organizations and of course, capital to support customer growth and to build cost performance chips for our customers' applications. So as I mentioned, we do a really good job of matching supply and demand and we do that in this business, it can result in quarters that we just saw. Andy Jassy : Yeah, I'll take the capex part of that. As Brian said in his opening comments, we expect to spend about $75 billion in 2024. I suspect we'll spend more than that in 2025. And the majority of it is for AWS and specifically, the increased bumps here are really driven by Generative AI. As I was mentioning in my own opening comments, our AI business is a multi-billion dollar business that's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year and is growing three times faster at its stage of evolution than AWS did itself. We thought AWS grew pretty fast. And so the thing to remember about the AWS business is the cash life cycle is such that the faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware. And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all of that upfront in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources. But of course, a lot of these assets are many year useful life assets. Data centers, for instance, are useful assets for 20 to 30 years. And so I think we've proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free-cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business and we expect the same thing will happen here with Generative AI. It is a really unusually large maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity. And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long-term that we're aggressively pursuing it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ross Sandler : Andy, if I could push on that last answer, you talked about how AI is about the same size but growing way faster than early AWS. And if we look back at the market in like the early 2010s is hypercompetitive on pricing, your margins were below 15%, I believe, back then. And it seems like a lot of that is what's going on right now in AI with these new AI data centers where you've got competitive pricing and suboptimal utilization just in the whole industry. So as that revenue line grows from where it is today to tens of billions of dollars in coming years, how does that margin come on from the AI data centers versus your existing kind of 30-plus-percent margin at AWS? Any thoughts on how quickly you can close the gap and how that looks on the new AI workloads versus maybe this mid-30s that the core business is running at? Thank you very much. Andy Jassy : Yeah. So some quick context, Ross. I think one of the least understood parts about AWS, over time, is that it is a massive logistics challenge. If you think about, we have 35 or so regions around the world, which is an area of the world where we have multiple data centers, and then probably about 130 availability zone through data centers, and then we have thousands of SKUs we have to land in all those facilities. And if you land too little of them, you end up with shortages, which end up in outages for customers. So most don't end up with too little, they end up with too much. And if you end up with too much, the economics are woefully inefficient. And I think you can see from our economics that we've done a pretty good job over time at managing those types of logistics and capacity. And it's meant that we've had to develop very sophisticated models in anticipating how much capacity we need, where, in which SKUs and units. And so I think that the AI space is, for sure, earlier stage, more fluid and dynamic than our non-AI part of AWS. But it's also true that people aren't showing up for 30,000 chips in a day. They're planning in advance. So we have very significant demand signals giving us an idea about how much we need. And I think that one of the differences if you were able to get inside of the economics of the different types of providers here is how well they manage that utilization and that capacity. It has a very direct impact on what kind of margins you have over time and what kind of capital efficiency you also have over time. And so I think you're right, Ross, that there are some similarities in the early days here of AI, where the offerings are new and people are very excited about it. It's moving very quickly and the margins are lower than what they -- I think they will be over time. The same was true with AWS. If you looked at our margins around the time you were citing, in 2010, they were pretty different than they are now. I think as the market matures over time, there are going to be very healthy margins here in the Generative AI space. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. Andy, I have two. The first one, I feel like we talk a lot about your targets and sort of north stars for domestic profitability. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you think about the drivers of international retail profitability from here and sort of how you -- just conceptually where the margins could go and what drives them there? And then the second one, I wanted to sort of ask you more about the robotics that you mentioned. I know you've been investing in robotics now for quite a few years. Where are you now in that journey? And how do we think about the next largest areas of investment in robotics in the warehouse network? Thanks. Brian Olsavsky : This is Brian. Let me take the first part of that question on international segment profitability. So if you've looked at the trends, we see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations certainly in operating profit in the international segment. But we're starting to see clear trend lines that are moving positive and above zero. And for each of the last seven quarters, as I mentioned, we've had year-over-year improvement in op margin. And in the last quarter, operating income was up $1.4 billion versus the prior year. So really, it is a lot of the same factors you're seeing in North America, lower cost to serve, greater contribution from advertising, improved selection, faster delivery speeds, which help drive consumer demand. And if you step back further, international is really a mix of our established countries where we've been operating for a long time, the UK, Europe, and Germany -- excuse me, Europe and Japan, and a number of emerging countries, including 10 new countries that we launched in the last seven years. So there's a lot under the hood there and there's different stories in each country. Each of them is on a different point in the path from launching to customer adoption, just scaling towards profitability to then making consistent operating profit. So I think our expectations in each of those countries mirror those in North America. And we intend, over the fullness of time, that we're going to aim for North America margins, which are not static themselves. So we're happy with the performance. Glad to see a number above zero in many of the last few quarters, but really it\u2019s a story on a country-by-country basis that we're working hard. On the robotics piece, what I would say is even though we believe we have more expansive and advanced automation, robotics capabilities in our fulfillment network than other peers, it's so early with respect to what we're going to do automation, robotics-wise in our fulfillment network. We're just at the stage right now where we're starting to roll out. We had about a five or six very significant new robotics capabilities in the areas of stowing, picking, packing, and shipping that we are finally put into one facility to get the entire workflow. It's a facility in Shreveport, Louisiana that was just launched a few weeks ago. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing very encouraging results there. And of course, the reason why we're trying to have more robotics and automation in our fulfillment network is it allows us to fast -- to ship more quickly, to ship more cost effectively, and to make conditions even safer for our fulfillment teammates than what they already have today. And I think something that the team has done in a very disciplined way, and I talked about this a little bit in my annual letter, my shareholder letter is just they have been very thoughtful about defining what are the primitive foundational building blocks that you need, that you can then use in lots of different combinations to build additional automation/robotics capabilities down the road, so we can move even more quickly with the next generation of robotics capabilities. And that team has invested in those and they're already working on the next generation. And the last piece I would add to that is we really do believe that AI is going to be a big piece of what we do in our robotics network. We had a number of efforts going on there. We just hired a number of people from an incredibly strong robotics AI organization. And I think that will be a very central part of what we do moving forward, too. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter, if I can. Looking at the results in the commerce business, there's a clear sort of pattern emerging with respect to ASPs versus unit growth. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and the propensity to be receptive to either lower ASP items or discounts among consumer behavior? And then the second part would be, can you talk a little bit about some of the strategic initiatives you're building for the long term around capitalizing on lower ASP items and the potential shift to more consumables and the base of consumption habits on the platform? Thanks so much. Andy Jassy : Yeah, hi, Eric, thank you for your question. Yeah, you're right. Q3 unit volume was strong, 12% worldwide. It's pretty similar in North America versus international. And the consumer factors, we've seen a continuation of many of the things we've discussed over the first -- or last few quarters. Customers looking for deals and are price conscious. This matches up well with our Prime events where we were -- which were well received and saved billions for our -- billions of dollars for our Prime members. It also led to Prime member -- paid Prime member growth accelerating in the quarter, which is hugely impactful for us. A lot of our best offers and deliveries are tuned to Prime membership, and it's the best deal in retail. So with all the benefits you get for the subscription price, so those are all positive signs. When you look at the split between revenue growth and unit growth, you do see some impact of the lower ASP products that we're selling as well as some of the trade down that consumers are doing. But we take that as a real positive, seeing the growth in everyday essential categories, which are really predicated on speed. So it's -- you have to have fast delivery to be able to sell the those products to customers. And when you do, it results in a stickier consumer relationship, higher orders, building larger baskets, which help our ship economics, and repeat orders are stronger. So those are all positive signs, and we'll take any short-term degradation in ASP because what we're focused on primarily is free cash flow here. And we see the ability to unlock all new elements of the consumer spend. Brian Olsavsky : I'll just add, Eric, on the lower ASP strategy. There's an expression that we've used a lot of times over the years that it's easy to lower prices but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices. And the same thing is probably true about lower ASP items. It's pretty easy to choose to supply them but it's much harder to be able to afford to economically supply them. And so one of the reasons that we have been so maniacal about cost to serve over the last few years is that as we're able to take our cost to serve down, it just opens up the aperture for more items, particularly lower ASP items that we're able to supply in an economic way. And when you layer on top of that the broader selection, you layer on top of that faster speed and what we're able to do in getting items and fulfillment nodes local and close to our end customers, what we're able to do in expanding our same-day network, which allows us to ship same-day but also is one of our lowest-cost ways is it just lets us serve so many more of customers' shopping missions. And that's what we're seeing in our business right now. But again, I think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to expand that. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. A question on online stores. The third-party unit mix declined a little bit in Q3, which is unusual. So just wondering if there are any specific drivers of that shift. And then secondly, you made a lot of progress with the AI agents on AWS and for sellers and Rufus for buyers. I wonder with all the underlying data that you have and leveraging those agent capabilities if you could provide any perspective on what a next-generation Alexa might look like and your opportunities there to perhaps drive incremental revenues. Thank you. Andy Jassy : Sure, Colin. Thanks for your question. On the first one, third-party sellers, yes, the percent of paid units was 60% in Q3. And if you look over the last two years, it's -- essentially, it was at 59%, stepping up to 60%, stepping up to 61% pretty much every second quarter. So what we're seeing is still in a tight band between 59% and 61%. But what we're seeing is the impact of the everyday essentials. There's -- 3P demand is still strong and unit volumes are strong. It's just the everyday essentials tend to skew more to 1P than 3P. And on your second question, Colin, around Alexa, I think we have a really broad number of Alexa devices all over people's homes and offices and automobiles and hospitality suites. We've about 0.5 billion devices out there with a couple of hundred million active endpoints. And when we first were pursuing Alexa, we had this vision of it being the world's best personal assistant and people thought that was kind of a crazy idea. And I think if you look at what's happened in Generative AI over the last couple of years, I think you're kind of missing the boat if you don't believe that's going to happen. It absolutely is going to happen. So we have a really broad footprint where we believe if we rearchitect the brains of Alexa with next-generation foundational models, which we're in the process of doing, we have an opportunity to be the leader in that space. And I think if you look at a lot of the applications today that use Generative AI, there's a large number of them that are having success in cost avoidance and productivity. And then you're increasingly seeing more applications have success in really impacting the customer experience and being really good at taking large corpuses of data and being able to summarize and aggregate and answer questions, but not that many yet that are really good on top of that in taking actions for customers. And I think that the next generation of these assistants and the Generative AI applications will be better at not just answering questions and summarizing the indexing and aggregating data, but also taking actions. And you can imagine us being pretty good at that with Alexa. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions. Just on the cloud, are you at all capacity constrained, and will the new Trainium or NVIDIA chips maybe even drive sales growth faster? And then secondly and I know there's been some competition from some of the more traditional retailers growing quickly online. Maybe talk about maybe the advantages that Amazon has with a fulfillment center distribution versus store distribution? Any thoughts on that? Thank you. Andy Jassy : Well, on cloud, Justin, what I would tell you is that we -- I believe we have more demand that we could fulfill if we had even more capacity today. I think pretty much everyone today has less capacity than they have demand for, and it's really primarily chips that are the area where companies could use more supply. And so we have -- we're growing at a very rapid rate and have grown a pretty big business here in the AI space and it's early days, but I actually believe that the rate of growth there has a chance to improve over time as we have bigger and bigger capacity. And I think that one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening comments that we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA. We tend to be their lead partner on most of their new chips. We were the first to offer H200s in EC2 instances. And I expect us to have a partnership for a very long time that matters. It's also true that for customers that start to scale out their implementations on the inference side, particularly, they realize pretty quickly that it can get costly. And it's really why we have pursued building Trainium and Inferentia, which is our custom silicon. And the second version of Trainium, Trainium2 will start to ramp up in the next few weeks. And I think it's going to be very compelling for customers on a price performance basis. And we have a lot of customer interest. We have gone back to our manufacturing partners a couple of times now to produce a lot more Trainium than we anticipated. Some of that, for sure, is due to the fact that we just -- we have very large demand, and we want more capacity and supply to be able to provide them. But a lot of it is that customers are excited about the price performance that they believe they're going to get in Trainium. So I think it's a very significant opportunity for us in the AWS space, and it's going to be a very significant opportunity for customers. I think on the retail side, I'd start by just saying that we've always believed that competition is very positive and very healthy. It's good for consumers, good for businesses. It's actually great for innovation. And if you look at the retail space, it's a very, very large market segment. I mean, we have a pretty big retail business, and yet we're only about 1% of the market segment share of the worldwide global retail market segment. And still about 80% to 85% of that market segment share lives in physical stores. And so if you believe that equation is going to flip in the next 10 to 20 years, which we do, there's just a lot of opportunity not just for us but for several players. There won't be only one successful player. I do think that we have some elements of our customer experience that are really unusual and unlike others. I think we have meaningfully broader selection than almost all the players that you probably have seen and heard of. We have low prices with very significant deals that we go work with our third-party selling partners around key holiday shopping occasions. And then we have very significant advantages and speed of delivery to customers. And we just continue to see in every bit of testing and analysis that we do, that the faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them their items, the more frequently they buy and the more they actually use Amazon for their shopping needs. And so those are things that are pretty different. I also think we have a way of prioritizing customers that I think is unusual. Our orientation, our DNA and our core at Amazon starts with the customer, and everything moves backwards from that. Any meeting you go to inside of Amazon, we're always asking ourselves what do customers want? What do customers say? What do they not like about the experience? What could be better? And that customer orientation is very important, not just in how you take care of customers, but the world changes quickly all the time. And the technology is changing really quickly. And so if you have the combination of strong technical aptitude, propensity and a passion for inventing and then also a customer orientation where it drives everything you do, I think you have an opportunity to continue to build great trust in a business over a long period of time. Dave Fildes : Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Dave Fildes : Thank you, sir. Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsoski, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 6, 2025 only and will include forward-looking statements, actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-Ks and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non GAAP measures. Including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. I will now turn the call over to Andy Jassy. Andy Jassy : Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $187.8 billion in revenue, up 10% year over year. Given the way the dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, we had $700 million more foreign exchange headwind than we anticipated at guidance. Without that headwind, revenue would have been 11% year over year and exceeded the top end of our guidance. Operating income was $21.2 billion, up 61% year over year, and trailing twelve-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $36.2 billion, up $700 million year over year. We're pleased with the invention, customer experience improvements, and results delivered in 2024, and have a lot more planned in 2025. I'll start by talking about our stores business. We saw 10% year over year revenue growth in our North America segment, and 9% year over year in our international segment, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Our continued focus on expanding selection, lowering prices, and improving convenience drove strong unit growth that even outpaced our revenue growth. We continue to add to our broad range giving customers choice across a variety of price points. We welcomed notable brands to our store throughout 2024, including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Aura Rings, and Armani Beauty. We continue to add to the hundreds of millions of products offered from our selling partners, who made up 61% of items that we sold in 2024, our highest annual mix of third-party seller units ever. We also launched Amazon Haul for US customers in Q4, which offers customers an engaging shopping experience that brings ultra-low priced products into one convenient destination. It's off to a very strong start. In the fourth quarter, consumers saved more than $15 billion with our low everyday prices and record-setting events during Prime Big Deal Days in October, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday around Thanksgiving. Additionally, Profitero's annual pricing study found that entering the holiday season, Amazon had the lowest online prices for the eighth year in a row, averaging 14% lower prices on average than other leading retailers in the US. Our speed of delivery continues to accelerate, and 2024 was another record-setting year for Prime members. We expanded the number of same-day delivery sites by more than 60% in 2024, which now serve more than 140 metro areas. Overall, we delivered over 9 billion units the same or next day around the world. Our relentless pursuit of better selection, price, and delivery speed is driving accelerated growth in Prime membership. For just $14.99 a month, Prime members get unlimited free shipping on 300 million items, off the same day or one day delivery, exclusive shopping events like Prime Day, access to a vast collection of premium programming and live sports on Prime Video, ad-free listening of 100 million songs and podcasts with Amazon Music, access to unlimited generic prescriptions for only $5 a month, unlimited grocery delivery on orders over $35 from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh for $9.99 a month, a free Grubhub Plus membership with free unlimited delivery, and our latest benefit of a 10 cent per gallon fuel discount at BP, AMPM, and AMCO stations. When you think about this as a whole, and also compared to many other membership services that are comparably or more expensively priced and offer just one benefit like video, Prime is a screaming deal. And we have more coming for our Prime members in 2025. We also remain squarely focused on cost to serve in our fulfillment network, which has been a meaningful driver of our increased operating income. We talked about the regionalization of our US network. We've also recently rolled out our redesigned US inbound network. While still in its early stages, our inbound efforts have improved our placement of inventory so that even more items are close to end customers. Ahead of Black Friday in November, we'd improved the percentage of ordered units available in the ideal building by over 40% year over year. We've also spent considerable time optimizing the number of items sent to customers in the same package, which reduces packaging, is more convenient for customers, and less expensive for us to fulfill. And our per-unit transportation costs continue to decline as we build out and optimize our last-mile network. Overall, we've reduced our global cost to serve on a per-unit basis for the second year in a row. While at the same time increasing speed, improving safety, and adding selection. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see opportunities to reduce costs again as we further refine inventory placement, grow our same-day delivery network, and accelerate robotics and automation throughout the network. In advertising, we remain pleased with the strong growth on a very large base, generating $17.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, and growing 18% year over year. That's a $69 billion annual revenue run rate, more than double what it was just four years ago at $29 billion. Sponsored products, the largest portion of ad revenue, are doing well, and we see a runway for even more growth. We also have a number of newer streaming offerings that are starting to become significant new revenue sources. On the streaming video side, we wrapped up our first year of Prime Video ads, and we're quite pleased with the early progress and head into this year with momentum. We made it easier to do full funnel advertising with us. Full funnel is from the top of the funnel with broad reach advertising that drives brand awareness to mid funnel where sponsored brands let companies specify certain keywords and audiences to attract people to their detail pages or brands to our Amazon to bottom of the funnel where sponsored products help advertisers surface relevant product ads to customers at the point of purchase. We also have differentiated audience features that leverage billions of signals from Amazon Marketing Cloud secure data clean rooms, providing advertisers the ability to analyze data, produce core marketing metrics, and understand how their marketing performs across various channels. With our new multi-touch attribution model, advertisers can understand how various ad types in their campaigns contribute to sales. Moving on to AWS, in Q4, AWS grew 19% year over year and now has a $115 billion annualized revenue run rate. AWS is a reasonably large business by most folks' standards. And though we expect growth will be lumpy over the next few years as enterprises adopt and technology advancements impact timing, it's hard to overstate how optimistic we are about what lies ahead for AWS' customers and business. I spent a fair bit of time thinking several years out. And while it may be hard for some to fathom a world where virtually every app is generative AI-infused, with inference being a core building block just like compute, storage, and database, and most companies having their own agents that accomplish various tasks interact with one another, this is the world we're thinking about all the time. And we continue to believe that this world will mostly be built on top of the cloud with the largest portion of it on AWS. To best help customers realize this future, you need powerful capabilities of all three layers of the stack. At the bottom layer, for those building models, you need compelling chips. Chips are the key ingredient in the compute that drives training and inference. Most AI compute has been driven by NVIDIA chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and will for as long as we can see into the future. However, there aren't that many generative AI applications of large scale yet, and when you get there, as we have with apps like Alexa and Rufus, cost can get steep quickly. Customers want better price performance, and it's why we built our own custom AI silicon. Tranium 2 just launched at our AWS reInvent conference in December, E2 instances with these chips are typically 30 to 40 percent more price per form than other current GPU-powered instances available. That's very compelling at scale. Several technically capable companies like Adobe, Databricks, Poolside, and Qualcomm have seen impressive results in early testing of Tranium 2. It's also why you're seeing Anthropic build its future frontier models on Tranium 2. We're collaborating with Anthropic to build project right near. A cluster of training and two ultra-servers containing hundreds of thousands of training m two chips. This cluster is going to be five times the number of Exo-ZLofts as the cluster that Anthropic used to train their current leading set of cloud models. We're already hard at work on Training 3, which we expect to preview late in 25, and defining Training 4 thereafter. Building outstanding performing chips that deliver leading price performance has become a core strength of AWS's, starting with our Nitro and Graviton chips in our core business, and now extending to Tranium and AI. It's something unique to AWS relative to other competing cloud providers. The other key component for model builders is services that make it easier to construct their models. I won't spend a lot of time on these comments on Amazon SageMaker AI, which has become the go-to service for AI model builders to manage their AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy these models. HyperPOD capability automatically splits training workloads across many AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40 percent. It continues to be a differentiator with several new compelling capabilities at reinvent including the ability to manage costs at a cluster level, and prioritize which workloads should receive capacity when budgets are reached. It is increasingly being adopted by model builders. At the middle layer, for those wanting to leverage frontier models to build Jet AI apps, Amazon Bedrock is our fully managed service providing high performing foundation models with the most compelling features making it easy to build a high-quality generative AI application. We are iterating quickly on Bedrock announcing Luma AI, poolside, and over a hundred other popular emerging models to Bedrock and reinvent. We've just added DeepSeq's R1 models to Bedrock and SageMaker. Additionally, we delivered several compelling new Bedrock features to re-event, including prompt caching, intelligent prompt routing, and model distillation, all of which help customers achieve lower cost and latency in their inference. Like SageMaker AI, Bedrock is growing quickly and resonating strongly with customers. Related, we also launched Amazon's own family of frontier models in Bedrock called Nova. These models compare favorably in intelligence against the leading models in the world to offer lower latency, lower price, about 75 percent lower than other models in Bedrock, and are integrated with key Bedrock features like fine-tuning, model distillation, knowledge base as a rag, and Agentec capabilities. Thousands of AWS customers are already taking advantage of Amazon Nova models' capabilities and price performance, including Palantir, SAP Densu Fortinet Trellix, and Robinhood, and we've just gotten started. At the top layer of the stack, Amazon Q is our most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. You may remember that on the last call, I shared the very practical use case where Q transformation helps save Amazon Teams $260 million and 4500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK. This is real value, and companies ask for more, which we obliged with our recent deliveries of Q transformation that enable moves from Windows dot net applications to Linux VMware to EC2, accelerates mainframe migrations. Early customer testing indicates the queue can turn was going to be a multi-year effort to do a mainframe migration into a multi-quarter effort, cutting by more than 50% the time to migrate mainframes. This is a big deal, and these transformations are good examples of practical AI. While AI continues to be a compelling new driver in the business, we haven't lost our focus on core modernization of companies' technology. We signed new AWS agreements with companies including Intuit, PayPal, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Northrop Grumman, The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, Reddit, Japan Airlines, Baker Hughes, the Hertz Corporation, Resin Chime Financial, Asana, and many others. Consistent customer feedback from our recent AWS reInvent was appreciation that we're still inventing rapidly in non-AI key infrastructure areas like storage, compute, database analytics. Our functionality leadership continues to expand and there were several key launches customers were buzz about, including Amazon Aurora D SQL, our new serverless distributed SQL database that enables applications with the highest availability strong consistency, post-test compatibility, It's four times faster reason rights compared to other pop distributed SQL databases, Amazon S3 tables, which makes S3 the first cloud object store with fully managed support for Apache Iceberg for faster analytics, Amazon S3 metadata, Which automatically generates queryable metadata simplifying data discovery, business analytics, and real time inference to help customers unlock the value of their data in S3, and the next generation of Amazon SageMaker which brings together all the data analytics services and AI services in interface to do analytics and AI more easily at scale. As 2024 comes to an end, I want to thank our teammates and partners for their meaningful impact throughout the year. It was a very successful year across almost any dimension you pick. We're far from done, and look forward to delivering for customers in 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update. Brian Olsavsky : Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $187.8 billion, an 11% increase year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to an approximate $900 million headwind from FX in the Quarter, which is about $700 million higher than what we'd anticipated in our Q4 guidance range. Excluding that additional FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $21.2 billion, our largest operating income quarter ever, and was $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Across all segments, we continue to innovate for customers while operating more efficiently at the same time. In the North America segment, fourth quarter revenue was $115.6 billion, an increase of 10% year over year. International segment revenue was $43.4 billion, an increase of 9% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year over year, as our focus on low prices broad selection, and fast shipping continues to resonate with customers. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion year over year. Operating margin was 8%, up 190 basis points year over year. In the international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.7 billion year over year, operating margin was 3%, up 400 basis points year over year. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen year over year margin improvement in both the North Two thousand twenty-four also marks the second year in a row where we've lowered our global cost to serve on a per unit basis.  In the fourth quarter, we saw strong productivity in our transportation network, from improved inventory placement, higher units per package, and reduced travel distances. We also saw improved productivity in our fulfillment centers. Overall, our teams executed extremely well throughout the quarter, and particularly during our peak seasons. I want to thank them for all they do to deliver for our customers. Looking ahead, we have several opportunities to keep lowering our costs through even better inventory placement, which also allows us to deliver items to customers faster. In the US, we're tuning our inbound network and continuing to expand our same day delivery network. Globally, we're adding automation and robotics throughout our network. While these efforts will take time to implement, and progress may not be linear, We have a good plan to continue to drive improvements in our cost structure. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong advertising revenue growth on an increasingly large base. We will also continue to invest in experiences that have potential to be important to customers in Amazon long term. In areas like Alexa, health care, and grocery, as well as satellites in the coming months. As a reminder, we currently expense the majority of the cost associated with the development of our satellite network. We will capitalize certain costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue was $28.8 billion, an increase of 19% year over year. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $115 billion. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI offerings. As companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. Customers recognize to get the full benefit of generative AI, they have to move to the cloud. AWS reported operating income of $10.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year over year. This is the result of strong growth, innovation in our software and infrastructure to drive efficiencies, and continued focus on cost control across the business. As we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year over year in Q4. Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash CapEx plus equipment finance leases. Capital investments were $26.3 billion in the fourth quarter, and we think that run rate will be reasonably representative of our 2025 capital investment rate. Similar to 2024, the majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS, including support demand for our AI services, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in capacity for our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth. We're also investing in same-day delivery facilities and our inbound network, as well as robotics and automation, to improve delivery speeds and to lower our cost to serve. These capital investments will support growth for many years to come. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q1, net sales are expected to be between $151 billion and $155.5 billion. I'd like to highlight two items impacting our Q1 revenue guidance. First, we estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $2.1 billion in Q1 year over year, or 150 basis points. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter, and just as we saw in Q4 with the strengthening of the dollar versus most other currencies. Second, a reminder that we are comping the impact of last year's leap year. The extra day contributed approximately $1.5 billion of additional net sales across our businesses in Q1 2024, or about 120 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate, which impacted all segments. Q1 operating income is expected to be between $14 billion and $18 billion. This guidance includes the estimated impact of certain updates to the useful life of our fixed assets. I'll provide a bit more detail in a moment, but on an aggregate basis, we estimate this will decrease full-year 2025 operating income by approximately $400 million for the assets on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. First, in Q4, we completed a useful life study for our servers and network equipment and observed an increased pace of technology development. Particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As a result, we're decreasing the useful life for a subset of our servers and networking equipment from six years to five years beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will decrease full-year 2025 operating income by approximately $700 million. In addition, we also early-retired a subset of our servers and network equipment. We recorded a Q4 2024 expense of approximately $920 million from accelerated depreciation and related charges and expect this will also decrease full-year 2025 operating income by. Both of these server and network equipment use for life changes primarily impact our AWS segment. Lastly, we also completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment used in our fulfillment centers. And are increasing the useful life from ten years to thirteen years beginning in January 2025, we anticipate this will increase full-year 2025 operating income by approximately $900 million. As we turn the page to 2025, we're energized by the great work our teams have delivered. We'll remain focused on driving even better customer experiences, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator : At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. If you would like to ask a question, we ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two quick questions. So, Brian, that's $100 billion CapEx we should think about in 2025. And then, Andy, were there any\u2014so would you describe that AWS growth as being currently moderated down by supply constraints. Do you see those across the industry, or do you see those materially impacting AWS today? Thank you very much. Brian Olsavsky : So I'll take both of those, Andy. On the CapEx side, as Brian mentioned earlier, we spent $26.3 billion in CapEx in Q4. And I think that is reasonably representative of what you can expect in the annualized CapEx rate in 2025. The vast majority of that CapEx spend is on AI for AWS. It's, you know, the way the AWS business works, the way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow, the more CapEx we end up spending because we have to procure data center and hardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when we're able to monetize it. We don't procure it unless we see significant signals of demand. And so when AWS is expanding its CapEx, particularly in what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign medium to long-term for the AWS business. And I actually think that spending this capital to pursue this opportunity, which, you know, from our perspective, we think virtually every application that we know of today is gonna be reinvented with AI in inside of it. And with inference being a core building block just like compute and storage and database, if you believe that plus that altogether new experiences that we've only dreamed about are gonna actually be available to us with AI, AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet. And so I think that both our business, our customers, and shareholders will be happy medium to long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI. We also have CapEx that we're spending this year in our stores business, really with an aim towards trying to continue to improve the delivery speed and our cost to serve. And so you'll see us expanding the number of same-day facilities from where we are right now. You'll also see us expand the number of delivery stations that we have in rural areas so we can get items to people who live in rural areas much more quickly. And then a pretty significant investment as well on robotics and automation so we can take our cost to serve down and continue to improve our productivity. So that's the CapEx piece. I think the second question you asked, Mark, is really around AWS growth and whether this is being moderated down at all by supply chain constraints. What you know, it's it is hard to complain when you have a multibillion-dollar annualized revenue run rate business in AI, like we do. And it's growing triple-digit percentage year over year. It's hard to complain. However, it is true that we could be growing faster if not for some of the constraints on capacity. And they come in the form of, you know, I would say, chips from our third-party partners coming a little bit slower than before with a lot of midstream changes. It takes a little bit of time to get the hardware actually yielding the percentage healthy and high-quality servers we expect. It comes with our own big new launch of our own hardware and our own chips in Tranium two, which we just went to general availability at reInvent, but the majority of the volume is coming in really over the next couple of quarters, the next few months. It comes in the form of power constraints where I think, you know, the world is still constrained on power from where I think we all believe we could serve customers if we were unconstrained. There are some components in the supply chain like motherboards that are a little bit short in supply for various types of servers. So, you know, I think the team has done a really good job scrapping and providing capacity for our customers so they can grow. We're still growing a pretty reasonable clip as I mentioned earlier. But I do think we could be growing faster if we were unconstrained. I predict those constraints really start to relax in the second half of '25, and, you know, as I said, I think we could be growing faster even though we're growing at a pretty good clip. Operator : And our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. I'll just ask one that's building on Mark's questions there. Andy, when you think about the news that came out of China over the last couple of weeks and think longer term about bending the cost curve lower with AI. I understood the commentary around CapEx for 2025. Would you look at where you sit in the industry the move towards open-source elements of custom silicon, How do you think about bending the cost curve and either speeding up or amplifying time deployment to market or possibly, you know, higher returns on capital for AI? Thanks so much. Andy Jassy : Well, I'll tell you a few things because there are a few questions built into that. You know, first of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeq has done. You know, I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, you know, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training, reinforcement learning being earlier without the human in the loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning. We also thought some of the inference optimizations they did were also quite interesting. For those of us who are building frontier models, we're all working on the same types of things, and we're all learning from one another. I think you have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us. There is a lot of innovation to come. And, you know, I think if you run a business like AWS, and you have a core belief like we do that virtually all the big generative AI apps are gonna use multiple model types and different customers are gonna use different models for different types of workloads. You're gonna provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock, and it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeq was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker. You know, faster than you saw from others. And we already have customers starting to experiment with that. I think what's, you know, one of the interesting things over the last couple of weeks is sometimes people make the assumptions that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component, in this case, we're really talking about inference, it's somehow it's gonna lead to less total spend in technology, and we just, we have never seen that to be the case. You know, we did the same thing in the cloud where we launched AWS in 2006, where we offered S3 object storage for fifteen cents a gigabyte and compute for ten cents an hour, which, of course, is much lower now, many years later. People thought that people would spend a lot less money in the on infrastructure technology. What happens is companies will spend a lot less per unit of infrastructure, and that is very, very useful for their businesses, but then they get excited about what else they could build that they always thought was cost prohibitive before. And they usually end up spending a lot more in total on technology once you make the per-unit cost less. And I think that is very much what's gonna happen here in AI, which is the cost of inference will substantially come down. You know, what you heard the last couple of weeks out of DeepSeq is a piece of it, but everybody is working on this. I believe the cost of inference will meaningfully come down. I think it will make it much easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI. And I think it's gonna if you run a business like we do, where we wanna make it as easy as possible for customers be successful building customer experiences on top of our various infrastructure services, the cost of inference coming down is gonna be very positive for customers and for our business. Operator : And the next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for any questions. I'll stick with AWS. To start. Just, Brian, maybe you can talk a little bit more about margins there just given that they've kind of moved between the mid-20s to the high thirties over the past two years. How should we think about that more normalized especially as you're investing that much more in generative AI? And then just on the store side, can you talk about the impact of less volume going through your shipping partner UPS going forward? And are you able to manage that incremental shipping that's required? Thanks. Andy Jassy : Yes. Sure, Doug. Thanks for your question. First on AWS, yeah, we have seen a lot of fluctuation in operating margin AWS, and we've said historically that they will be lumpy as you say over time. And, you know, the stage we're in right now, AI is still early stage. It does come originally with lower margins and a heavy investment load, as we've talked about. And in the short term, over time, that should be a headwind on margins. But over the long term, we feel the margins will be comparable to non AI business as well. So, you know, we're very pleased with the strong growth focus on driving efficiencies in all of our data centers, saving power, reusing power in new generative AI applications, and just generally reducing costs. So very pleased with the performance of the AWS team, and I look forward to a strong 2025. I'll take the UPS one, which is, really UPS has been a partner of ours for many years, and we expect that that we'll continue to be partners with UPS for many years. As you know, increasingly over the last several years, particularly accelerated by the pandemic, we have shipped a much larger percentage of our shipments through our logistics network, our own last-mile transportation network, and I think that's in part because we needed to scale up so fast in the pandemic with everything being shut down and needing to serve more of the total market segment share of retail units during that time. And needing to do it at a low-cost structure because, of course, our customers expect low prices, and that's the nature of the business. I think UPS has decided that serving Amazon is lower margin for them. So I think they've walked away from some of the volume that they otherwise could have had in the partnership. We're able to handle it with our own logistics capability, and we'll see how it continues to evolve. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. Andy, maybe to drill a little bit into the robotics acceleration that you talked about. Any new data points, I think you can share on learnings from Shreveport? And how do we think about the scalability of savings or the timing that we could see a real impact on profitability from robotics? And then maybe just a bigger picture Gen AI, GPU-enabled changes, any other examples of how you see the Amazon retail shopping experience changing throughout 2025 as you're better using Gen AI or GPU-enabled? Andy Jassy : Yeah. Okay. Well, on the robotics piece, what I would tell you is, you know, since we've been pretty substantially integrating robotics into our fulfillment network over the last many years, we have seen cost savings, and we've seen productivity improvements and we've seen safety improvements. And so we have already gotten a significant amount of value out of our robotics innovations. What we've seen recently, and I think maybe part of what you're referencing in Shreveport, is that the next tranche of robotics initiatives have started hitting production. And we've put them all together for the first time as part of an experience in our Shreveport facility, and we are very, very encouraged by what we're seeing there both by the speed improvements that we're seeing, the productivity improvements, the cost to serve improvements. You know, it's still relatively early days, and these all being put together are only in Shreveport at this point. But we have plans now to start to expand that and roll that out to a number of other facilities in the network, some of which will be our new facilities and others of which will retrofit existing facilities to be able to use those same robotics innovations. I'll also tell you that this group of, call it, half dozen or so new initiatives is not close to the end of what we think is possible with respect to being able to use robotics to improve productivity cost to serve a safety in our fulfillment network. And we have a kind of next wave that we're starting to work on now. But I think this will be a many-year effort as we continue to tune different parts of our fulfillment network where we can use robotics. And we actually don't think there are that many things that we can't improve the experience with robotics. On your other question, which is about how we might use AI in other areas of the business than AWS, maybe more in, I think you asked about our retail business. The way I would think about it is that there's kind of two macro buckets of how we see people, both ourselves inside Amazon, as well as other companies using AWS, how we see them getting value out of AI today. The first macro bucket, I would say, is really around productivity and cost savings. And, in many ways, this is the lowest hanging fruit in AI. And you see that all over the place in our retail business. For instance, if you look at customer service, and you look at the chatbot that we've built, we completely rearchitected it with generative AI. It's delivering; it already had pretty high satisfaction. It's delivering 500 basis points better satisfaction from customers with the new generative AI-infused chatbot. If you look at our millions of third-party selling partners, one of their biggest pain points is because we put a high premium on really organizing our marketplace so that it's easy to find things, there's a bunch of different fields you have to fill out when you're creating a new product detail page. But we've built a generative AI application for them. Where they can either fill in just a couple of lines of text or take a picture of an image or point to a URL, and the generative AI app will fill in most of the rest of the information they have to fill out, which speeds are getting selection on the website, easier for sellers. If you look at how we do inventory management, try and understand what inventory we need in what facility at what time, the generative AI applications we've built there have led to 10% better forecasting on our part, 20% better regional predictions. Our robotics, we were just talking about the brains in a lot of those robotics, are generative AI-infused that do things like tell the robotic claw, you know, what's in a bin, what it should pick up, how it should move it, where it should place it in the in the other bin that it's filling. So it's really in the brains of most of our robotics. So we have a number of very significant, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings efforts in our retail business. They're using generative AI, and again, it's just a fraction of what we have going. I'd say the other big macro bucket are really altogether new experiences. And, again, you see lots of those in our retail business ranging from Rufus, which is our AI-infused shopping assistant, which continues to grow very significantly. To things like Amazon Lens, where you can take a picture of a product that's in front of you, check it out in the app. You can find it in the little box at the top. You take a picture of an item in front of you, and it uses computer vision generative AI to pull up the exact item in a search result. To things like sizing where we basically have taken the catalogs of all these different clothing manufacturers and compared them against one another so we know which brands tend to run big or small relative to each other. So when you come to buy a pair of shoes, for instance, they can recommend what size you need, even what we're doing in Thursday Night Football where we're using generative AI for really inventive features like the sense of alerts where we predict which player is gonna put the quarterback or vulnerabilities where we're able to show viewers what area the field is vulnerable. So we're using it really all over our retail business and all the businesses in which we're in. We've got about a thousand different generative AI applications we've either built or in the process of building right now. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen. Please proceed. John Blackledge : Great. Thanks. Could you talk about the current speed of delivery, maybe how much more room to go there, and how is it driving the everyday essentials business? Then some of relatedly, any further color on inbound network efficiencies you would expect to see this year as you guys try to continue to lower the cost to serve. Thank you. Andy Jassy : Yeah. I would say on speed of delivery, that we measure this very carefully. And we measure both what the conversion rate is of somebody who views a product detail page with a faster delivery promise versus those that are slower as well as what we see downstream from customers once they've bought with a fast promise and what they end up buying throughout the year. And we have not yet seen diminishing returns of being able to continue to improve the speed of delivery. It doesn't mean that there won't be instances in which people are happy to take products later. You know, we have a program where if people want to pick a day during the week where they want to combine a bunch of their shipments and have it delivered then to be more sustainable and more environmentally friendly, they can. And we have plenty of customers who choose that, but we time in and time out see that people choose to buy from us more frequently when we're able to deliver to their homes or wherever they are much more quickly, and it leads to actually using us for more of their everyday purchases when we can do ever more quickly. And I think that if you look at what we're doing with Prime, you know, the promise there is for a number of items that we'll be able to deliver items to customers inside an hour. And I think when you're ordering everyday essentials where you need something more quickly, it's a big deal. And you see it, it's had a big impact on our everyday essentials. It's had a big impact on our pharmacy business where people are able to get items same day now in lots of cities throughout the US. And they're just using us much more frequently than they had before. The inbound network efficiencies, what I would tell you is, we made a pretty significant architectural change in our inbound network that we've been working on for the better part of the year that we rolled out just a few months ago. And it's what we find when we make big architectural changes like this is that you tend to get some low hanging fruit efficient early, but then there's all sorts of tuning and refinement you have to do once you actually see it working live across the really vast network. And we have all sorts of ways here that where I think it's early, and I think we're gonna get additional efficiencies throughout the year. But I expect that we'll have opportunities to keep taking our costs to serve down this year, and that'll be a big part of Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Michael Morton with MoffettNath. Michael Morton : Alright. Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to follow-up on Andy's remarks about how you're using AI within the Amazon eCommerce experience. But I wanted to talk about the other side of the coin, and that's really the eCommerce discovery process that leads people to Amazon. There's a lot of companies rolling out agents and assistants, and I would love to hear how Amazon is planning for potential disruption in this funnel and what the plans are. You spoke about Rufus, maybe make that more prominent. But what do you think the changes coming to the eCommerce funnel over the next several years would be great. Andy Jassy : Well, I would say that, you know, I think retailers ourselves and probably lots of other retailers, are all gonna have their own say on how they want to interact with agents. You know, I think that it's an emerging space, and if you think about the investments we've made in our fulfillment network, in our website, in all the selection that we've built, how we organize it. You know, most retailers are gonna have, you know, kind of terms in which they're gonna interact with agents, and we'll be no different that way. And I think that I do think that Rufus, if you look at how it impacts the customer experience, and if you actually use it month to month, it continues to get better and better. It's already, if you're buying something and you're on a product detail page, our product detail pages provide so much information that sometimes it's hard if you're trying to find something quickly to scroll through and figure and find that little piece of information. And so we have so many customers now who just use Rufus to help them find a quick fact about a product. They also use Rufus to figure out how to summarize customer reviews, so they don't have to read a hundred customer reviews to get an idea of what people think about that product. If you look at the personalization, you know, really, most prominently today, your ability to go into Rufus and ask what's happened to an order or what did I just order or can you pull up for me this item that I ordered two months ago? The personalization keeps getting much better. And so we expect throughout 2025 that the number of occasions where you're not sure which you wanna buy and you want help from Rufus are gonna continue to increase more and more helpful to customers. Brian Olsavsky : Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website for at least three months. Appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, Inc. and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
