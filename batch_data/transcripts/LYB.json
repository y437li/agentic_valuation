At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Douglas J. Pike: Well, thank you, Holly. Well, hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's first quarter 2014 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions. But before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Now reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website, at lyondellbasell.com. Now finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today until 11 p.m. Eastern Time on June 2 by calling (888) 566-0499 in the United States and (203) 369-3057 outside the United States. And the pass code for both numbers is 3675. Now during today's call, we'll focus on first quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. That being said, I'll turn the call over to Jim. James L. Gallogly: Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our website. Let's take a look at Slide #4 and review a few financial highlights. First quarter earnings per share were $1.72, with EBITDA of $1.67 billion. This is the fifth consecutive quarter with EBITDA in excess of $1.5 billion. Strong results continued despite headwinds created by scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, weather-driven raw material cost volatility and shipping delays. Cumulatively, these items impacted the quarter by approximately $300 million but were partially offset by first quarter price increases. We expect some of this impact to be recovered in the coming quarter. Overall, industry trends have remained relatively unchanged, although U.S. natural gas prices have been somewhat elevated following a very cold winter. Oil prices have remained relatively steady and seasonal trends are following their normal course. Our company performed significant maintenance in our U.S. operations in the first quarter. Given strong U.S. margins, this negatively impacted results. However, we also benefited from growth projects that are now online and advanced our new growth projects. I'll discuss these topics later in my remarks. Turning to Slide #5. You'll see that our safety statistics continue at the strong level that we have established over the past several years. While our statistics are very good, I'm saddened to say that during April, a contractor working for a third-party company that manages railcar movements at our Wesseling, Germany, site died in a tragic incident. We are assisting that company in their investigation. Our Wesseling site had achieved 3 million man hours without any injuries just prior to this incident, truly a world-class record. But obviously, we have more work to do. As you have often heard me say, safety is our top priority, so this type of event is very troubling to us. I'd like to now turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance. Karyn F. Ovelmen: Please turn to Slide #6, which charts first quarter segment EBITDA. As Jim said, overall, our results have been strong and steady. Within the segments, the O&P-Americas results were below the typical run rate of the past years. This is primarily attributed to maintenance and weather impacts. Jim will cover these items in more detail. In addition to these factors, there was an impact from our La Porte turnaround preparation, where during the quarter, we made outside purchases of close to 300 million pounds of ethylene, which negatively impacted results. In O&P-EAI, results exceeded recent quarters. We attribute this to an environmental indemnity settlement, improved margins and normal seasonal recovery following the fourth quarter holidays. In Intermediates & Derivatives, results followed recent trends. Oxyfuel results began the quarter with typical low winter margins, which improved as the quarter progressed. Methanol contributed strong results, while styrene and ethylene glycol weakened. Refining posted a quarter similar to the fourth quarter. Combined, these 2 quarters make up almost all of the last 12 months' earnings for this segment. The Technology segment continued to enjoy consistent strong earnings. Slide #7. Slide 7 provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During the first quarter, we generated $1.1 billion from our operations and issued $1 billion in 30-year bonds at 4.875% interest. Our cash balance declined slightly with cash use of $1.5 billion in share repurchases and dividends. During the past 12 months, we generated $4.8 billion in cash from operations, while raising $2.5 billion in cash from bond issuances. Almost $4.4 billion were used for share repurchases and dividends and another $1.5 billion invested in capital expenditures. On Slide 8, we summarize a few key aspects of our cash story. In the chart on the upper left, you can see the relatively steady cash generation from operations over the past 2 years, continuing into the first quarter. On the right, we have plotted the past 3-plus years of share repurchases and dividends, averaging approximately $2.8 billion per year. If you annualize the pace of first quarter share repurchases and dividends, it could be in the range of $6 billion for the year 2014. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 15 million shares, bringing the total purchase since last May, when we initiated the program, to approximately 42 million shares at the end of the first quarter. You have seen from recent press releases our shareholders approved a second share repurchase program at our annual meeting and the Supervisory Board approved a $0.10 per share increase of the quarterly interim dividend to $0.70 per share. Now I'll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results. James L. Gallogly: Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance, beginning on Slides 9 and 10 with Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas. First quarter EBITDA was $736 million, $147 million less than the fourth quarter. Operationally, first quarter results were negatively impacted by a number of maintenance items, including unscheduled maintenance at our Channelview crackers. This required us to temporarily reduce production by an estimated 160 million pounds. Late in the quarter, we began the La Porte ethylene plant turnaround, which impacted production by approximately 40 million pounds. As Karyn mentioned, in preparation for the turnaround, we purchased approximately 300 million pounds of ethylene. During the quarter, we also conducted a significant turnaround at our Matagorda polyethylene site. Collectively, these events generated most of the variance between the 2 quarters. Weather also had an impact, both through delayed shipments and increased cost of feedstock in natural gas. Slide #9 provides a perspective on natural gas and NGL costs. January and February experienced cost pressure, but the beginning of spring brought some relief. The chart on the right side of the page indicates that the benchmark cost of ethylene production metric has returned to a level similar to the fourth quarter. However, natural gas costs have remained somewhat elevated, increasing utility costs. Despite all of this volatility, ethylene margins remained relatively steady. Our average ethylene price increased by approximately $0.02 per pound. The cost of ethylene production increased similarly, in part due to increased natural gas and NGL costs. During the quarter, ethane accounted for 75% of our ethylene production and NGLs represented 87%. Within polyolefins, polyethylene prices increased by $0.03 per pound, while sales volumes remained relatively unchanged. Preturnaround planning mitigated impacts on our polyethylene sales. Polypropylene results were relatively unchanged. Overall, the quarter for O&P-Americas was not on our normal pace. But the reasons for this were primarily transitory. The weather-related margin pressure that we experienced during January and February was relieved during March and the quarter finished on a strong note. During the second quarter, our focus will be on the successful completion of the La Porte turnaround and expansion. The downtime related to this will impact ethylene production. However, the impact on sales and EBITDA should be mitigated by the first quarter inventory build. Let's turn to Slide #11 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. First quarter EBITDA was $356 million, $241 million greater than the fourth quarter. Results include a $52 million benefit from an environmental indemnity settlement with previous owners. As we had expected, results also benefited from a seasonal recovery following the year-end holidays. Olefin results improved by approximately $65 million. Margins improved by several cents per pound due to a combination of lower naphtha raw material costs, use of advantaged feedstocks and moderately higher coproduct prices. Our ethylene plants operated at approximately 93% of capacity, which was significantly above reported industry rates. Approximately 35% of our ethylene production was sourced from raw materials with advantaged economics versus naphtha. Combined polyolefin results also improved, reflecting both increased European margins and volumes. Combined polypropylene compounds and polybutene-1 results increased by approximately $30 million, reflecting the typical seasonal recovery. Joint venture equity income was a strong $54 million, but no dividends were paid this quarter. Business conditions during April have been relatively consistent with those experienced during the first quarter. Now please turn to Slide #12 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $375 million, almost $20 million higher than the fourth quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results improved due to seasonal volume recovery versus the fourth quarter. Intermediate chemical performance declined, primarily due to weaker styrene and ethylene glycol results. Margins were pressured by the increased benzene and ethylene costs. This weakness was partially offset by increased acetyl results. Acetyls benefited from increased methanol, acidic acid and VAM volumes and margins. The Channelview methanol plant operated for the full quarter at approximately 85% of nameplate capacity. Oxyfuel results benefited from seasonally improved spreads, but this was partially offset by lower volumes. The temporary closure of the Houston Ship Channel delayed some vessel movements, impacting results by approximately $10 million. April business conditions have been generally similar to conditions experienced late in the first quarter. In conjunction with the La Porte olefins turnaround, our acetyl operation at the site will be down for 2 to 3 weeks. Sales will be met through inventory. Let's move to Slide #13 for a discussion of the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $129 million, relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $28.26 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 247,000 barrels per day. The spread at the refinery increased following a trend similar to the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark. Crude oil throughput increased versus the fourth quarter, contributing approximately $5 million to first quarter results. However, our product mix and yield were negatively impacted by coker maintenance. Additionally, increased natural gas and RIN costs negatively impact the results by a combined $20 million. April benchmark spreads have averaged approximately $29 per barrel, in line with the March spread. We took a 1-week outage on one of our crude units during April. RIN and natural gas costs have been reasonably consistent with March costs. Our Technology segment continued to perform well, with the catalyst business slightly ahead of 2013 results. Segment results improved as a result of our past restructuring efforts and reduced R&D costs. The next 5 slides provide an update on our growth program. You may recall that we're scheduled to bring online a new project almost every 6 months during the end of 2015. The benefit is already visible in our earnings. For example, the Channelview methanol plant started on schedule during December and contributed approximately $50 million to first quarter EBITDA. During late March, we initiated production at our Matagorda polyethylene facility, which now has an additional 200 million pounds per year in capacity due to the debottleneck. This project was generally on schedule with costs in line with our estimates. As you can see from Slide #14, the next project in the queue is a major expansion at our La Porte ethylene plant. We currently anticipate that will start up mid-year with an EBITDA impact within the range that we previously discussed and plotted on the chart. The next 3 slides provide a visual perspective on progress since last October. At that time, we were erecting a tower at the methanol plant. Today, it's online and contributing to our EBITDA. The Channelview expansion was a mere hole in the ground when we last discussed it. Today, you can see that the furnaces are really taking shape. At La Porte, we were erecting furnaces. Today, the furnaces are up and the final steps of the expansion are underway. We have approximately 2,800 contractors on-site. We have been moving quickly because the sooner we can bring these projects onstream, the sooner we can increase earnings and cash flow. Slide #18 updates the cost and status for both the active and previously discussed developing projects. As a quick review, the light blue denotes projects that have been completed. The medium blue represents projects that are currently underway. The projects highlighted in dark blue are projects that we are developing. They're not yet under construction. The cost estimates and timing represent current estimates, while the potential pretax earnings column is based on 2013 industry benchmark data. Our 2013 margins would yield similar earnings. If you compare this chart to past versions, you'll notice that the projects generally remain on schedule, but that we're experiencing increased costs on several projects. For example, the methanol project cost increased due to higher construction wages and hours worked as we strive to maintain a very aggressive startup schedule. The polyethylene expansion project was completed on schedule and within our cost estimates. The La Porte ethylene expansion is in full swing with the turnaround completion targeted for June. We have experienced cost escalation on this project in terms of scope, labor efficiency and materials cost escalation. Some of this is related to our aggressive schedule and working on a large-scale debottleneck within an operating plant. The Channelview ethylene expansion remains on track, both in terms of schedule and cost. This has been a less complicated project to execute as we're only adding 2 furnaces to the existing plants. We received the final permits for the Corpus Christi ethylene expansion in mid-April. I first introduced this project to you over a year ago when the scope was still under definition. At that project stage, capital estimates were typically in the range of plus or minus 50%. On this chart, our estimates have been updated to reflect a more defined scope and the recent realities of Gulf Coast construction cost. The timing remains on track with the forecast that we made over a year ago. Our polypropylene compounding projects have moved forward as planned. Last year, we added 2 new lines. And during 2014 through 2016, we expect that we'll add another 4 lines. Spending will be in the order of $10 million and $15 million per year to make these additions. Let's next discuss 2 of the projects that are not yet in construction. You might recall that we have been developing a new polyethylene process with the intent to build the first plant at one of our locations, and then add the technology to our licensing portfolio. Work has proceeded well over the past year. Our Supervisory Board recently approved advancing the project to the next stage, during which we will finish engineering and purchase long-lead items. Permit applications were filed during the fourth quarter. The cost estimate and timing on the chart incorporate the final process design and the addition of site-specific infrastructure costs. Previous estimates were conceptual and only included the polyethylene line itself. The Chinese PO/TBA joint venture has advanced at a slower pace due to the general slowdown in the Chinese economy. We now believe that completion will be in 2018. Along with moving many projects forward, we also took the decision to cancel the olefins' NGL recovery project. While developing the details of the capital project, we simultaneously pursued commercial options that would eliminate the need for capital, while accelerating the timing of earnings. We recently renegotiated a contract that met these criteria. Going forward, we will recover a greater portion of the economic benefit of our gas stream from the third party without making the capital investment. We are very disciplined with capital. And if we don't need to spend your money to get incremental benefits, we won't. In summary, our project slate is very strong and is adding value today. Our projects are being completed on schedule. Project definitions and the construction cost environment are clearer today than a year ago. This has resulted in cost increases. But we expect the other projects will still have wonderful returns. We think that the labor market in the Gulf Coast is in the early years of an up cycle. We're very happy that most of our projects are under construction now rather than later. During 2014, we will continue to build momentum across the company. Market conditions, coupled with our internal focus on efficiency, enable us to pay a strong growing dividend while utilizing additional cash to acquire shares. We're now pleased to take questions, Holly. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division : First one, kind of a couple announcements by either competitor or supplier that have some impact on you. The first would be Enterprise's export of ethane and the 240,000 barrels a day number that they put out kind of coming online late in '16. One, just want to get your take on the plausibility of that actually coming up on time. And then how should we think about maybe an over-under for how much ethane will be exported out of the U.S. in, say, '17 and '18? And then the second question is around this morning's announcement by Westlake that they're going to pursue an MLP. And just want to get your take on -- obviously, it's company-by-company fit. But is there a fit with an MLP for Lyondell going forward? James L. Gallogly: Okay. The first question on the Enterprise ethane export terminal. That's a large project, 240,000 barrels per day. And to say that they'll start up in mid-2016, that's a very aggressive schedule. But I'm sure that they've considered what the construction timing would be. I would first say that's a big vote of confidence in a strong oversupply of Gulf Coast ethane. They stated in the press release that the supply could exceed demand by 700,000 barrels per day by 2020. That's very, very strong. And that's after all of the new crackers are built. So they are very, very bullish. That capacity, as you know, is equivalent to about 3 world-scale crackers and 20% of current supply. So it's a very big and an important announcement. We have been studying whether we could effectively use ethane in our cracking in Europe. And in fact, I had a review with our European team 2 short weeks ago. It just doesn't work for us. When we look at propane, butane cracking, condensate cracking, and it just seems to be so much better for us. I know that INEOS has a project that's announced. But that's, what, 10,000 barrels ramping up to 20,000 barrels per day. I'm having a hard time understanding how that kind of volume could go to Europe. Some of it must be going to Asia. And I wonder if some of that isn't going to be used to spike LNG in a couple of the countries, where they have some lean gas supplies. I know that they haven't contracted all of that volume yet. We're anxious to see further details as that's worked out with Enterprise, how much of that is actually going to move. As you said, it's an aggressive schedule, and we'll see how that develops. But once again, I think the important note is they have a lot of confidence and a very long position in ethane. Otherwise, they wouldn't be making that type of investment. Second, on Westlake MLP, as we reported some time ago, we also studied an MLP. Our tax position on our assets is different than some others. We did go through bankruptcy 4 years ago and had some asset write-downs. And so the tax implications may be different from us. We've looked at it. We continue to look at it. Obviously, the market has reacted very favorably to Westlake's announcement. We'll take a look at all of that and continue our evaluation. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And Karyn, just a follow-up question for you. On the 300 million pounds of inventory you built, is it rule of thumb fair to say that there's about a $0.25 margin in that so that was about a $75 million hit to Q1 earnings? Karyn F. Ovelmen: Yes. More or less, it's probably a little bit higher than that. And then again, we would expect to see that returning in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. John J. Hirt - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This is John Hirt on for P.J. today. Curious, looking at your methanol facility now that it's up and running and, I guess, it ran at 85% in the first quarter, it would seem to be a logical MLP candidate, given that it's a standalone plant. I think you've mentioned in the past that you've got some debottlenecking opportunities there and you just put in about $100 million -- $180 million of fresh capital. So I'm just curious if that's an asset you'd be willing to put into an MLP structure. James L. Gallogly: John, that's a new item that we will look at. The asset hasn't been running very long. We just brought it up in December. We'll continue to advance -- ramp up the rates. We're going to do a little bit of unscheduled work in the third quarter on some heating tubes. But otherwise, that thing -- we think we can debottleneck it and get some extra capacity. Margins are holding up reasonably well. And it's definitely adding to our earnings. We'll take a peek at the MLP for that asset as well. John J. Hirt - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then your O&P - Europe, Asia and International business was up nicely year-over-year. With propane swinging into favor in February and March and I think it's still in favor today, to what extent have you been able to take advantage of that? And can you just kind of talk about your feed slate mix in Europe today, given that you're now free from some of those unfavorable naphtha contracts? James L. Gallogly: Yes. Well, the first quarter we ran at about 35% of advantaged feedstocks. Typically, in the summer, we can ramp that up. We'll be looking to do that as opportunities present themselves. That segment had a very nice first quarter. Margins were up on falling naphtha prices, and we ran our crackers at 93% capacity, which is outstanding, have been able to move the polymer volumes reasonably well. And of course, our businesses, such as polybutene-1, our compounded businesses performed very nicely as they always do from quarter-to-quarter. So we're pretty proud of the results in Europe. We're definitely differentiating ourselves from our competitors there. And we expect to continue to do that in the future. Operator : Next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Jim, could you talk about -- in the past, you talked about maybe doing another round of kickbacks following this ramp, probably smaller in scale. And I'm just wondering, given what you're noting on the cost side of things and we still have crackers ahead of us, do you think that another round of sort of debottlenecking or brownfield-type stuff is prohibitive from a cost perspective at this point? James L. Gallogly: Vincent, I don't think it's cost-prohibitive. It depends on where you do it and how you do it. But as you said, we like to do the debottleneck kinds of things, where the capital is naturally cheaper. One of the things I didn't mention in the base part of the call was that despite these cost increases in a couple of our olefins expansions, we're still bringing those on at something in the order of 2/3 of cost of other people's incremental production on a cents per annual pound basis. So they're not only earlier, but they're also quite a bit cheaper. We always look at those cost increases that we're seeing right now could delay some other projects that people are looking at. Their cost would definitely go up based on what we're seeing in labor rates, productivity, other kinds of costs like that. But we're going to be very sensitive as we do our economics and make sure that those additional capital projects do make sense. And as we put the engineering together, we will start announcing those. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just as a follow-up to the ethane export situation, could you just give a little bit more detail as to why your analysis said that exports for your facilities didn't work? Was it sort of the CapEx you would have to invest? Or is it sort of the relative opportunity with the other feedstocks? What were sort of the big bottlenecks for you? James L. Gallogly: Yes. It was both of those things. It's -- we can run some of those crackers lighter than we do today. But generally, that's 20%, maybe 25% on some of those furnaces without a fair amount of modifications. They're slightly different than that. Some of its transportation issues because some of our crackers are inland. But frankly, when we looked at propane, butane, some of the condensates, the economics really favored the slightly heavier feedstocks when you looked at all the transportation costs and everything else. It just didn't work very well for us. I was hoping it would. Operator : The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Jim, can you discuss the M&A pipeline? There's potentially a large transaction available on the plastics side. If greenfield doesn't make sense from a U.S. perspective, do you look more towards M&A longer term to perhaps integrate downstream? Douglas J. Pike: Dave, I'm sorry, this is Doug. You weren't too clear on our side. I think you were asking about the future for M&A? David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes. The M&A pipeline, given potential assets on the plastics side, any interest -- can you discuss your interest in those? James L. Gallogly: David, we're same place on M&A as we've always been, it has to be significantly accretive. Nothing has come on to the market that has been of interest to us lately. And as we previously said, we always evaluate all those opportunities as against buying our own shares. And so far, our own shares, in our view, is better value. And obviously, we know the company well and like our prospects. David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And just lastly, on the refinery, Jim, discuss the timing of the Canadian crude coming down into your operations and potential impact this year and next. James L. Gallogly: Yes. As we've mentioned, we're expecting additional volumes to come in, in the second half of the year. Flanagan South is slightly delayed. But we expect still that to be kind of a third quarter event and allow us to ramp up Canadian crudes at a nice discount, which should help our Refining earnings. One of the things that's been happening is obviously the Maya 2-1-1 spread has been pretty decent, fourth quarter, first quarter and now into the second quarter. So with a little better operations, we should be able to have better earnings in that segment. Operator : The next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Yes, 2 questions. On La Porte turnaround, what other impact will you have other than the inventory that you built? Did you have to buy some inventory? And so will that negatively affect margins as you go into Q2? James L. Gallogly: Don, that primarily had a first quarter impact. We did have to buy about 300 million pounds of ethylene to cover. And as we are in the second quarter, we're now selling that or using it on our own operations. So that should have somewhat of a positive impact in the second quarter, whereas it was a negative in the first. Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And then on your EU feedstock flexibility. I know earlier in the year, you renegotiated a long-standing naphtha supply arrangement that you had. What was the benefit? Did this just give you more flexibility to use advantaged feedstocks? Or did you actually negotiate a reduction in the benchmark price for that naphtha contract? James L. Gallogly: Yes, that was -- it wasn't just all naphtha, there were some other feedstocks, certain instances, we got slightly lower pricing. But the primary benefit of that is a lot more flexibility because we had basically take-or-pay requirements that would push us to process an awful lot of naphtha, when sometimes we would prefer to crack something different. By lowering the volumes on that, we're now able to bring in some advantaged feeds when available. Some of that is seasonal, some of it is not seasonal and can be done year-round as, for instance, we just showed with first quarter with 35% advantaged feeds. Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : And what kind of benefit you think that's going to have on a full year basis going forward? James L. Gallogly: Well, it really depends on what propane, butane and that is doing in the marketplace. Right now, it's fairly advantaged. But in the summertime, it's historically been even more advantaged. So we'll just have to see how that develops into the year. Operator : Next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Jim, I was wondering if you could comment on the sequential pattern of profitability at the refinery. It looks like your benchmark spread improved and your throughput ticked up a bit and the earnings were off $5 million. What is going on there? Is it crude slate or the coker outage impact? James L. Gallogly: It was more of the coker outage impact. It didn't let us process what we wanted to process and really hit the mix of products in the back end. So that was more of the story. And we had said last quarter that we still had some work going on, on that, and that's now been completed. Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Very good. And then second, you'd indicated kind of weather-related impacts of about $300 million, partially offset by some price increases. Can you give us a sense regarding how much of that pressure you might expect to recover in 2Q and beyond, if any? James L. Gallogly: Yes. We'll get some of that back in the second quarter. But kind of to put that in perspective, a couple hundred million dollars was related to O&P-Americas, and then about another $100 million was related to increased natural gas, oxyfuels shipping delays, couldn't get some cargoes out. And then the coker stuff at the refinery increased natural gas prices. Douglas J. Pike: Yes. Kevin, this is Doug. I just want to clarify that, that $300 million that Jim stated was not just weather. That was also largely the maintenance, where we had the planning for La Porte. We had our La Porte polyethylene facility and its turnaround. And then we had some weather-related maintenance and some other maintenance in some of the olefins plants. So that really encompasses the whole thing, not just the weather. James L. Gallogly: Yes. That's very important to make sure that, that's clear. I mentioned the La Porte turnaround cost is 40 million pounds of ethylene and a couple of Channelview crackers using another 160 million pounds. And then we talked about weather-related things as well. So all of that is in that total mix, that 200 million [ph]. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors : Again wanted to revisit this whole European ethane export side of things. Obviously, from one side of it, there's fear that there may be tightness in the U.S. ethane market on the back of this. But let's say that all of this volume does eventually arrive in Europe. I mean, obviously, there are going to be some fairly severe coproduct consequences as well, particularly on the propylene and butadiene side of things. So I would love to sort of hear your views around that. James L. Gallogly: Yes. If all of that could go to Europe, and my view is, if we're talking about the Enterprise deal, I think that's highly, highly improbable from what I understand the economics looks like and the ability of crackers to even take it. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors : I would imagine for companies -- you would have companies shutting down downstream units if they were to do that. James L. Gallogly: Yes. There'd have to be a lot of work to accomplish it. And I just don't know how that gets done. Frankly, when we do our economics, it's also much easier to shift polyethylene than ethane. And that's why you see all these cracker announcements versus these kind of projects. There must be more to that story than we're seeing. And that's why we're anxious to hear more. But if your premise were basically right that, that all could go to Europe, it would have a significant impact on coproducts. It'd run up propylene prices, it'd run up butadiene prices, be significant shortages. But all of that stuff goes into our computation when we decide what we're going to crack every day. So I just don't see how that all that capacity could go to Europe. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors : Fair enough. Now as a follow-up, changing gears a bit, you had mentioned that in terms of usage of cash, you'd look at acquisitions obviously being accretive and the like. I mean, could you comment on just your appetite in terms of specialty versus commodity? Because again and again, obviously you've reiterated the back-to-basic strategy. Does that still hold? James L. Gallogly: Yes. There's several companies that like to talk about becoming more specialty-oriented. We're very happy with who we are. We compete very well. We have a commodity mindset in the way that we maintain our cost, the way that we work our debottlenecks in adding cheap capacity. We also believe that very well-run commodity chemical companies perform better across the cycle than specialty. So overall, we're more interested in accretive transactions versus whether they're this type or that type. We're interested in high return on our capital and the deployment of our cash. Operator : And our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division : There's been a number of announcements on around condensate splitters being built over the next couple of years. And I was curious to get your thoughts on if that would change the economics at all at Corpus. Obviously, you're doing an expansion there, too. And if so, how that would affect the economics there? James L. Gallogly: Yes. Actually, I think there will be some condensate splitters built. And frankly, we're looking at that as well because we have some opportunity potentially to do that at a very cheap cost. So we think it's a positive development for us instead of a potential negative. Yes, condensate prices could in theory go up. But we expect there to be a lot of condensate available, some out of South Texas already from the Eagle Ford that has a positive impact on us, to the point where we're just not taking any Middle East condensate in our U.S. operations any more. And we expect some additional condensates to come from some of the Northeast fields, particularly the Utica. So we think there's an opportunity for us there for the Corpus at our refinery, and we'll see how that all develops. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division : And then just a follow-up on that. Obviously, there's still wrangling going on in Washington whether condensate can be allowed to be exported. But if there's all this capacity that comes on, it may not matter because you'll have a lot of naphtha. In either case, would you be a participant either on condensate exports or naphtha exports into your European assets? James L. Gallogly: Well, so far, we haven't needed to export any naphtha into our European operations. But potentially condensates could move in at the right pricing, although one of those things that's happened is there's been a displacement of foreign imports into United States. Those have been flowing into our European operations. And in fact, in one instance, we just changed a contract from being a U.S. contract to a European contract and moved those cheap condensates in. Operator : Next question is Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : A quick couple of questions. First, can you give a sense for how -- what you think aggregate outages will be as a headwind in Q2 and possibly also Q3, if you have that available? James L. Gallogly: Yes. There's a fair amount of capacity that we expect to be down in olefins in the second quarter. Obviously, La Porte is down now, our asset, and we talked about that being an 80-day outage. DuPont has a cracker down. ExxonMobil Beaumont and Baytown will be down. We're hearing about 10% of capacity down. And then with the pipeline looking like it's coming up into Louisiana, we're already seeing spot ethylene move up fairly aggressively. So we think that's all a nice development for margins into the second quarter. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And then secondly, on the European dynamic, in terms of condensate and naphtha coming available, is -- are you seeing any competitor assets that would not be able to benefit from that dynamic over the next several years that would just keep the cost curves steeper? Or is this going to be something that everybody in the industry should eventually be able to benefit from? James L. Gallogly: Well, I think the United States and the Middle East assets still are so competitively advantaged. It all gets down to a crude-to-natural gas ratio. And we still very much favor -- like what we see here in the United States and our Middle East assets are also benefiting. But we see that ratio staying high. And that's why you see people like Enterprise making announcements like they did. One thing I should have also said is obviously Europe has a large number of inland crackers. So that's something to consider when you start thinking about the ability to take advantaged feedstocks. There aren't that many coastal crackers with that kind of opportunity. Operator : Next question I'm showing comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Thanks so much, Jim, for the project-by-project review. I thought it was interesting in listening to the commentary about the rising labor and material costs that you're seeing. So it kind of begs the question regarding all these mega crackers that may be coming up in 2016, 2017, even 2018, what are your thoughts about those projects? And how should we be thinking about that timeframe in terms of startups, et cetera? James L. Gallogly: Those projects are going to be expensive. We're already seeing a lot of pressure. Since we're in the field today, we can see firsthand what's going on. And there's a couple of dynamics. One, labor is definitely going up and the quality of that labor is not what it used to be. And so productivity is going down, and that's at this stage when there's not as much out there to do. We're still in the early phases. So when some of those big projects ramp up, I think it's going to get worse, not better. So I would expect cost to be higher and I expect things to come in a little slower. We'll see what really develops. But I can tell you from our own experience, that's absolutely what we're seeing today. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : All right, terrific. And then obviously, you have a very enviable balance sheet. You spent over $1 billion on buying back stock in Q1. Does that pace seem reasonable for Q2 and beyond? Karyn F. Ovelmen: Yes. So as of, you'll see we're going to file our Q here, you'll see as of the end of last week, we had approximately 10 million shares remaining on the initial 10% authorization. And the expectation is that we will purchase that through the end of this May. And then we have the new authorization. It's about 53 million shares, which we have authorized over the next 18 months. James L. Gallogly: Yes. So I'd say we have a great balance sheet and we like our growth prospects a lot. So we're making an acquisition of ourselves. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Jim, I was wondering if we're to presume that there is going to be a massive ethane imbalance for quite some time, have you seen that expressed yet in any greater willingness for long-term contracts or fixed fractionation margin contracts or something, where you could lock in a more secure price over the next 5 or 10 years? James L. Gallogly: No, I really haven't. That's why I'm a bit anxious to see what's going on with the Enterprise project to see if there are more details on what they're doing. But right now, I don't see that. We'll just have to see how that develops. Frankly, if it's as long as we think, we're still going to get great pricing. And so we're happy to let it all develop like it's going on right now. Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And do you suspect that it's possible, like if they really had 3 virtual ethane crackers pop up in Europe, would that make your cracker system even better, would we get into some shorter supply that some of these -- as we've seen in the U.S.? Or is it just a drop in the bucket, given the scale of assets already over there, just won't make a big difference? James L. Gallogly: Well, I just frankly can't see how all that Enterprise volume goes to Europe. Physically, I just don't know how that happens and how it gets integrated into the crackers over there. And I don't see anybody that would build a new ethane cracker over there with these kind of economics, you'd build it here in the United States immediately and not have that shipping cost. So there's got to be more to their story. I think there must be an Asian dimension that we don't understand yet. Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And I've seen some producers suggest the potential for ethane imports into Europe have allowed them to negotiate better feedstock terms. Have you seen that creep up at all for you? James L. Gallogly: Not really. Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And the last one, if I might. On the Refining side, do you think there's any scope for any change in the ethanol mandates in gasoline? James L. Gallogly: I hope so. Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : But do you think there is? James L. Gallogly: I think we'll know more in a short period of time. But at least in the first EPA announcement on certain of the cellulosic volumes, they were realistic on that. So we hope good judgment prevails. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Jim, when you say lighter feedstocks just don't work for you in Europe, is -- that's because of the propylene and propylene oxide integration that you've got over there? James L. Gallogly: No, not really. This -- when I say lighter feedstocks don't work, I want to be careful. I said ethane doesn't work. Propane and butane does. Condensates do. Obviously, when we crack lighter like that, we make less propylene, less butadiene. But overall, within our system, we're still a major purchaser of propylene anyway. We're very short. And so that we're buying on the open market. So overall, it's more a question of lightening up somewhat. Last year in the summer, we went quite a bit lighter and in the first quarter, maybe almost 1/3 of the feed. So we'll keep working that, trying to make money. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then as a follow-up, it seems pretty certain that CapEx will decline materially in 2016. I know that's a little ways out here. But is that far enough out that you could have some shorter-term projects come in and back-fill on the CapEx side? James L. Gallogly: Well, we're not going to have all the big projects that we do today to expand U.S. olefins. We want those online soon. And that's why we've been racing to get those projects finished. But we'll have another pipeline of projects that come back in that point in time but maybe not as much as we're doing right now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Robert Rightsees [ph] with Broadwright Capital [ph]. Unknown Analyst : I just have one quick question. Regarding the first 2 months of the year. I was trying to put together how much that cost you with the weather and some of the outages, et cetera. And I'm not sure if you were saying a couple hundred million here and there. But could you give us either margin number or a dollar number, what you think the weather and some of those effects cost you in the first quarter? James L. Gallogly: Yes. What we're seeing is in O&P-Americas, the impact was about $200 million. And then there was $100 million of other items on the rest of the portfolio related to weather, natural gas prices, coker outage, all of those kinds of things. Douglas J. Pike: And Bob, there's a little bit of an offset, of course, across the quarter as we raised prices moving across the quarter. James L. Gallogly: And February was our toughest month. March was much better. Operator : I am showing no further questions at this time. James L. Gallogly: Okay. Well, thank you very much. We expect a very solid second quarter in U.S. O&P-Americas. As I said, the first quarter was not on our normal pace. We have the La Porte turnaround as a key project and other growth projects moving ahead very rapidly. So we feel very good about U.S. O&P. EAI had a strong first quarter, running at exceptional rates, 93%, way above industry averages. And we think we're performing differentially in Europe compared to our peer groups. I&D had another very solid quarter, performing as expected. And now with methanol online, we have upside in our Refining operations. Margins are good. We just need to run better. So we feel very good about our future. We're investing in our company. We've increased the regular dividend and are buying back our shares. We have a very bright future, and we thank you for your support. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time. Have a great day.",

And the pass code for both numbers is 3675. Now during today's call, we'll focus on second quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. And with that being said, I would like turn the call over to Jim. Jim Gallogly : Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our Web site. Let\u2019s take a look at Slide Number 4 and review a few financial highlights. Second quarter earnings per share were $2.22, with EBITDA up approximately $1.94 billion, both represent record quarterly results. Every segment contributed to our strong earnings. Underlying oil and natural gas fundamentals continue to provide a strategic advantage of our North America businesses. However, the quarter could have been even better, had we not experienced various internal operating issues and third-party disruptions. These issues particularly impacted our O&P Americas and intermediates and derivatives businesses. I will speak more about those in a moment. Turning to Slide Number 5, you will see that our safety statistics continue at the level that we established over the past several years. We were recently recognized by the American Chemistry Council as the Responsible Care Company of the Year in our size category. We are very proud of this award as it demonstrates our strong commitment to safety and environmental stewardship. I would now like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance. Karyn Ovelmen :  Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Slide number 6, which charts second quarter and last 12 month segment EBITDA. As Jim said, our results have been strong and steady. Within the segments, the O&P Americas business established a new record as EBITDA was slightly less than $1 billion. In O&P-EAI, our EBITDA of approximately $320 million was slightly higher than the strong underlying first quarter result. Intermediates and Derivatives continued to follow normal trends. Oxyfuels results improved as we entered the summer gasoline blending season. Exclusive of this seasonality, results were relatively unchanged from the first quarter. Refining posted results similar to the last two quarters. The Technology segment continued to report consistent strong earnings. Slide 7 and 8 provide a picture of our cash generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated $1.6 billion from our operations. Our cash and short-term security balance declined by $850 million, as we devoted $2.2 billion to share repurchases and dividends. Capital spending was consistent with our full year guidance of approximately $1.6 billion. During the past 12 months, we generated $5.3 billion in cash from operations and raised $2.5 billion from bond issuances. This cash was devoted to share repurchases and dividends totaling $6.1 billion. Another $1.5 billion went towards capital investment with approximately 50% towards growth projects. I\u2019ll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results. Jim Gallogly :  Thanks, Karyn. Let\u2019s discuss segment performance beginning on Slide number 9 with Olefins and Polyolefins Americas. Second quarter EBITDA was $978 million a record quarter and $242 million greater than the first quarter. Operationally our La Porte Olefins plant was down throughout the quarter versus the planned mid June start up. The plant operated briefly during early July prior to shutting down to address a compressor issue. We restarted over this past weekend. Second quarter sales were met through inventory, new purchases and some operating adjustments across our system, however July sales have been impacted by the equipment issue. In total the turnaround and subsequent equipment related delay have reduced annual ethylene production by approximately 600 million pounds. We estimate the delayed restart impacted the second quarter by approximately $50 million. Despite the delayed restart Olefin results significantly outperformed the first quarter increasing by approximately $220 million. This was partially related to the impact of first quarter ethylene purchases and inventory build in preparation for the turnaround. The second quarter benefited from a lower cost per unit of ethylene production due to both lower raw material cost and increased co-product values. During the quarter ethane accounted for 72% of our ethylene production and NGLs represented 85%. Our average ethylene price decreased by approximately $0.01 per pound, contribution from our Naphtha\u2019s unit was relatively unchanged. Within Polyolefins to polyethylene spread over ethylene increased by approximately $0.02 per pound. Polyethylene sales were steady with exports representing approximately 13% of the volume. Our 200 million pound per year polyethylene expansion at Matagorda operated to expectations throughout the quarter, however during June tight ethylene availability impacted polyethylene sales volumes. Polypropylene results were relatively unchanged. Thus far during the third quarter industry conditions have remained relatively strong and are benefiting from lower ethane prices. The delayed La Porte restart is expected to impact third quarter ethylene production by approximately 100 million pounds. The delay will also impact ethylene derivative sales. We expect to increase ethylene production at La Porte to the expanded capacity during September. This 800 million pound expansion will increase our U.S. ethylene system capacity to 10.7 billion pounds annually. Work continues on the 250 million pound per year Channel View expansion. Additionally we\u2019re beginning construction on the 800 million pound Corpus Christi expansion on receipt of our environmental permits. Let\u2019s turn to Slide number 11 and review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $319 million, exclusive of the first quarter environmental indemnity settlement, this was approximately $15 million better than the first quarter. Olefin results improved moderately versus the first quarter, naphtha cost increases and a $0.02 per pound ethylene price decline were more than offset by increased co-product prices and the benefit from processing advantage raw materials. Approximately 55% of our ethylene production was sourced from advantage raw material such as propane, butane and condensates. Our ethylene plants operated at approximately 95% of capacity, significantly above reported industry rates and slightly above our first quarter rate. Results for both Polyolefins and Joint Ventures also improved from the first quarter. Combined polypropylene compounds and PB1 results were unchanged. Following normal seasonal trends third quarter polyolefin and polypropylene compound volumes are expected to be slightly lower than the second quarter. Naphtha prices have fallen somewhat which is expected to improve olefin margins at least temporarily. During the third quarter equity earnings are anticipated to be impacted by the scheduled turnaround at two Joint Ventures. Now please turn to Slide number 12 for a discussion of our intermediates and derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $430 million, $55 million higher than the first quarter. The primary contributor to this improvement was a typical seasonal increase in Oxyfuels margins and volumes. Propylene oxide and derivative results declined by approximately $20 million versus the strong first quarter results, a portion of the decline can be attributed to seasonal propylene glycol demand into the aircraft deicing industry. Lower solvent margins also contributed to the decline. The quarter finished with tight market conditions following a fire at a European competitor\u2019s facility. Intermediate chemical performance improved by approximately $10 million. Styrene results improved by approximately $20 million from higher volume and margins following first quarter maintenance, this helped to absorb lower EOEG results driven by lower margins. Within acetyls, lower methanol margins were offset by increased acetic acid and final acetate monomer results. During the second quarter, we experienced some planned and unplanned downtime at our Channelview and La Porte acetyls complexes. The seasonal increase in Oxyfuels margins and volumes led to an approximately $65 million increase in results. The majority of the improvement can be attributed to lower butane raw material costs relative to gasoline prices. The change in the industry benchmark can be seen in the chart on the lower right. Across the segment, overall July business conditions have been relatively similar to the second quarter. We anticipate that the incident at our competitor\u2019s propylene oxide styrene monomer facility would benefit propylene oxide during the quarter. However styrene margins have temporarily declined due to increase benzene costs. It is difficult for Oxyfuels margins to decline late in the third quarter, but it\u2019s difficult to forecast either the timing or the magnitude of the decline. Let\u2019s move to Slide number 13 for a discussion of the refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $137 million slightly better than the past two quarters. During the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $27.01 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 257,000 barrels per day. The spread at the refinery decreased following a trend similar to the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark. Crude oil throughput increased versus the first quarter, contributing approximately $10 million to second quarter results. Fuel products yields improved versus the first quarter but this was largely offset by lower byproduct values. During the quarter, Canadian and light crudes represented almost 25% of our throughput. Exports accounted for approximately 5% of finished fuel product sales. July benchmark spreads have averaged approximately $26 per barrel in line with the second quarter spread. Thus far, RIN costs for the quarter are relatively unchanged. Operationally, during the third quarter, we have a scheduled HTS catalyst change which is expected to negatively impact product yields. EBITDA in the Technology Segment contributed -- continued to be strong at $71 million. In summary, during the second quarter, we generated record EBITDA and earnings but results could have been even better due to equipment and supplier problems. We completed our initial 10% share repurchase program and initiated purchased under the second 10% authorization granted in April. We finished the quarter with 515 million shares outstanding, a reduction of 62 million shares since the program began for approximately 11%. Apart from the delayed La Porte turnaround, business conditions during the first weeks of the third quarter have been similar to the second quarter with some typical industry volatility. We have now restated the La Porte ethylene plant and expect to implement the ethylene expansion later in the quarter. The Channelview and Corpus Christi expansion are progressing as planned. We are now pleased to take questions, Holly. Question: and: Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bob Koort : Jim I am curious on your latest and greatest thoughts on the NGL complex. We can look out now, it looks through the 2016 and see sub $0.30 ethane prices, I think there have been some concern maybe as units came back online, this summer you get a rally in ethane but it doesn\u2019t seem to be happening, so I wonder if you could just give us some assessment of maybe ethane, propane and if you have any thoughts on butane? Goldman Sachs : Jim I am curious on your latest and greatest thoughts on the NGL complex. We can look out now, it looks through the 2016 and see sub $0.30 ethane prices, I think there have been some concern maybe as units came back online, this summer you get a rally in ethane but it doesn\u2019t seem to be happening, so I wonder if you could just give us some assessment of maybe ethane, propane and if you have any thoughts on butane? Jim Gallogly : Bob, the ethane prices have fallen quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. They are down in the low 20s at this point in time I think most people did expect rise in the summer but they are doing exactly the opposite. Some of that is due to various operating issues. As you are probably aware, there is complex at Port Arthur, a olefins cracker that is down due to fire, there has been a variety of operational issues, our turnaround went long. And so as a result of those things and then very, very strong supply, the prices have fallen. I think that\u2019s very, very positive for a business. Propane prices have come down some butane prices. That\u2019s been helpful for us in Europe, particularly in butane. We have been cracking lighter there particularly out of there facility. So all of this has been positive for our results and natural gas prices have also fallen and so things are looking good. Bob Koort : I know it\u2019s not a huge business but certainly helped incrementally in the last couple of quarters the methanol industry is seeing price drop to about a two year low, is that just an echo of gas or do you think there is incremental supply that\u2019s pressuring prices or what\u2019s happened there and what\u2019s your outlook on methanol? Goldman Sachs : I know it\u2019s not a huge business but certainly helped incrementally in the last couple of quarters the methanol industry is seeing price drop to about a two year low, is that just an echo of gas or do you think there is incremental supply that\u2019s pressuring prices or what\u2019s happened there and what\u2019s your outlook on methanol? Jim Gallogly :  Methanol has come down as you say, natural gas prices have come down, that\u2019s part of it people have cooperated a bit better. There were some turnarounds earlier, so my impression is that we bounced off the bottom there. It seems to be firming a bit, so we will see how that develops. Operator :  Next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer :  Yes, good morning. The first question is just around La Porte, how should we think about the effect of the July shut down and how should we think about the ramp of that 800,000 pounds coming on in September, when will that kind of get the full run rate? Barclays Capital :  Yes, good morning. The first question is just around La Porte, how should we think about the effect of the July shut down and how should we think about the ramp of that 800,000 pounds coming on in September, when will that kind of get the full run rate? Jim Gallogly :  First about the turnaround, we have originally thought that turnaround will take us about 80 days it took us about 115 days. We had a considerable amount of work to do. It took longer than we had expected and then we had the first stage compressor of our crack gas machine blow a seal there when we restarted that took us a couple of more weeks to get back on line that certainly wasn\u2019t expected. But our people worked incredibly hard and I am proud of what they have done. It just took so much longer than we expected. I indicated about how much that impacted our first quarter, our second quarter in our prepared comments, about a 100 million pounds here in July. In terms of the 800 million pounds, we have got two furnaces that are almost mechanically complete. They are on schedule. We have increased the budget for that project as you know in-part because we can see the turnaround cost probably going up and labor cost increasing, productivity going down a bit. So, it\u2019s about at the cost that we had forecasted recently, taking a bit longer will bring one of the new furnaces up in the second and it shouldn\u2019t take us very long to line them out. We haven\u2019t operated before the big furnaces but we are pretty hopeful we will get those on-stream and bring them up rapidly. One item taking care of the start-up of La Porte was pretty smooth. Duffy Fischer : Great and then on the tax rate getting better, some of that I am assuming is just because Europe is contributing more profitability in vacuum NOLs and lower tax rate there. But is there some other structural stuff and how should we think about the tax rate going forward? Barclays Capital : Great and then on the tax rate getting better, some of that I am assuming is just because Europe is contributing more profitability in vacuum NOLs and lower tax rate there. But is there some other structural stuff and how should we think about the tax rate going forward? Karyn Ovelmen :  With regards to the effective tax rate, there is a change in the mix of the earnings floor primarily due to increases in non-taxable income and some internal financing and partially offset by changes in our valuation allowances. Going forward for the remainder of the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 28%. Operator :  Next question is from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John McNulty :  Wanted to check with regard to your European business, clearly Europe you are really processing a lot of advantage raw materials at 55% of your suede. How much further do you think you can push at this point and are there other opportunities may be adjustments if you can make with a little bit more investment that even further broaden that opportunity? Credit Suisse :  Wanted to check with regard to your European business, clearly Europe you are really processing a lot of advantage raw materials at 55% of your suede. How much further do you think you can push at this point and are there other opportunities may be adjustments if you can make with a little bit more investment that even further broaden that opportunity? Jim Gallogly : John, European crackers are running lighter than they used to, to be sure whether it is propane or butane we have been able to crack lighter. Our folks over there learning from what we have done here in the United States and the way to take those flexible crackers and take them to new levels. We have very modest capital that we are putting in to help but it\u2019s minor. It\u2019s more of a learning as we go, obviously we have improved there. We have also cracked more common sites and that\u2019s been positive for us. So, we are running at great rates, 95% utilization is so far above what\u2019s happening in the rest of the industry that\u2019s a plus for us. I think between the cost structure changes that we have made 1,000 people or so less than we used to operate within that region. Lining out our operations and working hard on the revenue side. We have been able to post quarter after quarter good solid results in Europe. John McNulty :  Thanks. And then just a quick question, we have seen with some of the outages we have seen really moving north pretty solidly over the last month or so, yet we haven\u2019t really seen much on the polyethylene side in terms of movement. I guess if you can give us an update on your thoughts on that and what may be holding it back or if it\u2019s just a timing issue? Credit Suisse :  Thanks. And then just a quick question, we have seen with some of the outages we have seen really moving north pretty solidly over the last month or so, yet we haven\u2019t really seen much on the polyethylene side in terms of movement. I guess if you can give us an update on your thoughts on that and what may be holding it back or if it\u2019s just a timing issue? Jim Gallogly : Polyethylene margins are very strong right now and a lot of price increases haven\u2019t happened. Our perception is that market is extremely tight, some of these ethylene outages have an impact on those derivatives and we have seen some competitor announcements of force majeure. We have been in force majeure. I think the market is tied and I think some of the forecasters are saying polyethylene prices should go up in the United States. Operator :  Next is Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy :  Yes, good morning. Jim, there has been some tremendous M&A activity recently across the chemicals industry. Just wondering if you could comment on whether you see anything in your pipeline that might be tempting or whether it\u2019s more likely we will continue on in the current passes returning cash through meaningful repurchase activity\u2026 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Yes, good morning. Jim, there has been some tremendous M&A activity recently across the chemicals industry. Just wondering if you could comment on whether you see anything in your pipeline that might be tempting or whether it\u2019s more likely we will continue on in the current passes returning cash through meaningful repurchase activity\u2026 Jim Gallogly : Kevin, we\u2019ve been very active in the M&As here but buying our own shares. We still think we are the best investment out there and we completed our first 10% program, commenced the second 10% program. We watch every asset that comes to market, we evaluate it. So far we haven\u2019t seen something, that\u2019s been attractive to us, but we remain open to accretive transactions if they appear. We obviously have a great balance sheet and the ability to execute should something appropriate appear. But again, today we like ourselves as the best investment. And in terms of whether returning cash to shareholders, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated year-to-date that we are very willing to do that in a significant way. Kevin McCarthy : Certainly. And as a second question, can you provide us any updates on your timelines for expansions at Channelview and Corpus how is that tracking? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Certainly. And as a second question, can you provide us any updates on your timelines for expansions at Channelview and Corpus how is that tracking? Jim Gallogly : Yes. The Channelview and Corpus projects are tracking as we expect. The last time we talked that everyone on our earnings call, we did update the cost profile that was primarily related to Corpus. The Channelview expansion is two furnaces, we already have the tie-ins ready. So that should be a fairly simple transition from to bring those assets online. That\u2019s expected to be early 2015 for Channelview for the couple of furnaces and then at Corpus, like 2015, we expect it to progress as we earlier indicated. Operator : Next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar : There seems to be a targeted effort to export more hydrocarbons from the U.S. did the approval of this condensate exports recently. So how does it impact your Corpus Christi operations, but you are buying some distressed cargoes and then also your refinery? Citigroup: There seems to be a targeted effort to export more hydrocarbons from the U.S. did the approval of this condensate exports recently. So how does it impact your Corpus Christi operations, but you are buying some distressed cargoes and then also your refinery? Jim Gallogly : Yes. So far P.J., we haven\u2019t seen much impact at all on condensate, so they are very long in South Texas and seem to be increasing instead of decreasing. What we are working on right now is getting some of that pipeline up into the Houston region instead of barging to reduce our cost even further. So far that\u2019s been in the mix. I think when the original announcements of a couple of people moving some condensates offshore and that was approved by the department of energy when that was approved people thought gee maybe that\u2019s a change step. I think after that\u2019s been evaluated people maybe don\u2019t believe that so much. And we still think that these discounted Texas condensate show up in our mix, primarily in cracking more at Channelview and some at Corpus, but not so much in our refinery at this point. P.J. Juvekar : Thank you. And have you seen any progress on ethane exports on the U.S. I mean have you heard of any new contracts being signed or what are your thoughts on sparking LNG with ethane? Thank you.  Citigroup: Thank you. And have you seen any progress on ethane exports on the U.S. I mean have you heard of any new contracts being signed or what are your thoughts on sparking LNG with ethane? Thank you. Jim Gallogly : Well, so far I haven\u2019t heard of any new thing, so there has been an announcement that Reliance is looking building some tankers, but how that\u2019s sourcing there hasn\u2019t been a lot of detail. But still based on maybe a feature of 300,000 barrels per day things that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s still in the 2020 period, something 10% to 15% of the volume, so we think it\u2019s manageable. Of course we\u2019d rather stay home, but it is competitive world and some volumes could be exported. Operator : Next question is Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : I was surprised that how strong your EBITDA was in the olefins business in the United States. I would have thought that benchmark margins year-over-year were lower both on the NGL side and on naphtha side. So my guess is that there might have been a positive artifact from the purchases of ethylene in the first quarter. Was there a material benefit or could you quantify that benefit that you might have received? JPMorgan : I was surprised that how strong your EBITDA was in the olefins business in the United States. I would have thought that benchmark margins year-over-year were lower both on the NGL side and on naphtha side. So my guess is that there might have been a positive artifact from the purchases of ethylene in the first quarter. Was there a material benefit or could you quantify that benefit that you might have received? Jim Gallogly : Jeff, there is arguably some benefit. Movement from first quarter to second quarter, but we already talked about that in our prepared remarks. I actually was disappointed in our Olefin results in the second quarter. As I said the turnaround went longer, I wish we would have been up in the middle of June with our cracker and posted some more numbers. So it was a record quarter for that business as I have tried to be very clear, we could have done even better. Jeff Zekauskas : I don\u2019t recall the quantification that you\u2019ve provided.  JPMorgan: I don\u2019t recall the quantification that you\u2019ve provided. Jim Gallogly : Jeff, maybe I can help you out a bit. If you recall what we\u2019ve done is with the turnaround at La Porte in the second quarter, we were preparing for that in the prior quarters. So as we spoke about first quarter results, we talked about a $150 million basically it was from purchases and inventory, so some of that moved forward. Now if you think about that, so that impacts the first second quarter comparison. In the second quarter what we have is really the turnaround running a couple of weeks longer that required us to go into the market and purchase some additional inventories and that\u2019s the $50 million that Jim spoke about previously. Jeff Zekauskas : All right, and I can follow up on that. And then secondly, the crack spreads seem to be moving lower, can you talk about prospects for your refinery operations in the third quarter and do you plan to provide methanol volume, methanol production volumes in your I&D segment in the future as you provide so many of the data for the things you produce. JPMorgan: All right, and I can follow up on that. And then secondly, the crack spreads seem to be moving lower, can you talk about prospects for your refinery operations in the third quarter and do you plan to provide methanol volume, methanol production volumes in your I&D segment in the future as you provide so many of the data for the things you produce. Jim Gallogly :  Yes, let me comment a bit, first on refining and then I\u2019ll talk about methanol volumes. On refining, the two on one crack spread is down a bit; we\u2019re running very well at the refinery at the moment, well above nameplate. That\u2019s positive. We haven\u2019t done that recently but you know I\u2019m quite pleased that Todd and his team are doing a nice job running the asset hard like we should. We\u2019ve had better yield structure, I think we\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job of purchasing crude and so while the two on one is a bit lower, we\u2019ve been able to make up for that. We\u2019ve now been able to post a few quarters in a row of decent refining margins and I\u2019m happy to say that business operationally is doing better. On I&D in methanol, we had some downtime. We had some supplier interruptions in one of our sites and then some of the loan downtime at Channelview, we don\u2019t typically give those volumes but they have been -- there\u2019s room for improvement there as well. Operator :  Next is from Evelyn Rodriguez with UBS, your line is open. Evelyn Rodriguez :  Thank you, good morning guys, just one quick question. Of course given that fundamentals are not very strong we\u2019d just like to change the subject a little bit to something that investors seem to be focusing on. That\u2019s MLPs. Can you remind us again why, or why not, is that more of a challenge for you to do something similar that your competitor in Houston is doing and what assets are available for you to potentially do some that way. UBS :  Thank you, good morning guys, just one quick question. Of course given that fundamentals are not very strong we\u2019d just like to change the subject a little bit to something that investors seem to be focusing on. That\u2019s MLPs. Can you remind us again why, or why not, is that more of a challenge for you to do something similar that your competitor in Houston is doing and what assets are available for you to potentially do some that way. Jim Gallogly :  We'll continuing to study the possibility for an MLP, we\u2019re watching very closely our competitor and how that transaction goes over the next days and we obviously could do the same thing, our asset base is dramatically larger and so that opportunity is greater, we\u2019re not sure the market\u2019s that\u2019s big but certainly we could do that. Olefins is a core business for us, is very-very key as we talk to investors some favor this, some don\u2019t but we will continue to study it. One of the differences is, we went through bankruptcy in 2009, early 2010 and our assets were written down so you know the tax basis is quite different so I suspect our economics are different in that particular transaction in a variety of ways. Operator :  Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities your line is open. Frank Mitsch :  Good morning folks and congrats on the record, and obviously a record in O&P Americas despite the issues at La Porte. As I think about it, you\u2019re going to continue to have some issues here in Q3 in La Porte but the order of magnitude is going to be lower than what is was in Q2 and it sounds like margins are trending in the right direction for O&P Americas in Q3 so, would it be surprising if we sit here three months from now talking about yet another record in O&P Americas in Q3? Wells Fargo Securities :  Good morning folks and congrats on the record, and obviously a record in O&P Americas despite the issues at La Porte. As I think about it, you\u2019re going to continue to have some issues here in Q3 in La Porte but the order of magnitude is going to be lower than what is was in Q2 and it sounds like margins are trending in the right direction for O&P Americas in Q3 so, would it be surprising if we sit here three months from now talking about yet another record in O&P Americas in Q3? Jim Gallogly :  Well we try not to give those kind of forecasts but the market is very tight right now. Ethane prices are low and we\u2019re running better, I mentioned that the refinery is running above nameplate. We\u2019ve got all that horsepower now at La Porte and we\u2019re running above nameplate there despite the fact that we don\u2019t have extra couple furnaces. So we\u2019ll try to put products in the pipe and we\u2019ll see what margins are. Frank Mitsch :  All right, fair enough and then just looking at I&D, you know you mentioned the [indiscernible] business margins are improving in the VAM area obviously there were some operational issues that probably contributed to that. Can you update us on where that stands and where the [indiscernible] stands in that area? Wells Fargo Securities :  All right, fair enough and then just looking at I&D, you know you mentioned the [indiscernible] business margins are improving in the VAM area obviously there were some operational issues that probably contributed to that. Can you update us on where that stands and where the [indiscernible] stands in that area? Jim Gallogly :  Yes, VAM margins are strong right now, we\u2019re back running but we got to rebuild inventories so you know assuming we can continue to run well there we should be in good shape, we\u2019ve got the issues that we had lined out at this moment, some of those were third party issues as well, occasionally the things that happened on our equipment but in some of that it was third party. Operator :  Don Carson with Susquehanna, your line is open. Don Carson :  Jim, a question on some of your future growth projects, as you complete Channelview and Corpus Christi next year, you will have the bulk of your expansions behind you. I know in the past you talked about perhaps 400 million of growth projects that you identified. Beyond that have you identified more and as if not, as your CapEx starts to wind down because your expansion spending declines, should we expect an acceleration in return of cash to shareholders? Susquehanna:  Jim, a question on some of your future growth projects, as you complete Channelview and Corpus Christi next year, you will have the bulk of your expansions behind you. I know in the past you talked about perhaps 400 million of growth projects that you identified. Beyond that have you identified more and as if not, as your CapEx starts to wind down because your expansion spending declines, should we expect an acceleration in return of cash to shareholders? Jim Gallogly :  Don, we'll continue to work potential growth items. I did mention that we have an opportunity at Channelview to do some backend work. It looks like a very good project economics as we do our preliminary engineering, look like may be a 400 million pound expansion there. In addition to what we already have is the possibility at we think a reasonably low cost, so we'll keep working there. We have talked about a polyethylene plant. We are studying a couple other growth projects. We are always aware that capital costs are going up in the timeframe of \u201816, \u201817, \u201818 because of all the work going on. So, we are going to be hopefully smart about what we bring on and when we do it but some of these debottleneck opportunities and expansion opportunities still look very good to us. In terms of return of cash to shareholders, I think since we have been a new company regardless of whether it\u2019s being special dividends, regular dividends, share repurchases. I think we have set a very nice track record of being shareholder friendly. Don Carson :  So, with that $400 million basket you have identified as possible growth projects beyond 2015, is that number now growing with some of these other things you have identified? Susquehanna:  So, with that $400 million basket you have identified as possible growth projects beyond 2015, is that number now growing with some of these other things you have identified? Jim Gallogly :  We're continuing to work right now and the capital budget cycle at the front end of that and looking at a variety of things that we began to do the initial engineering on. So, it\u2019s a bit early for me to comment on what all we'll include but we've been spending roughly $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in capital. We've got -- we should expect something like that next year although that budget isn\u2019t finalized and then after that we'll see what else we can add to the portfolio. Operator :  Next is from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Your line is open. Nils Wallin :  With ethane here in the low $0.20 range and natural gas below $4 it seems like ethane prices are actually below their fuel value. I know you said that there were some turnarounds that probably affects it but is there anything else, is there incremental supply that is contributing to this below fuel value price for ethane and do you think that\u2019s going to continue through the rest of the year? CLSA:  With ethane here in the low $0.20 range and natural gas below $4 it seems like ethane prices are actually below their fuel value. I know you said that there were some turnarounds that probably affects it but is there anything else, is there incremental supply that is contributing to this below fuel value price for ethane and do you think that\u2019s going to continue through the rest of the year? Jim Gallogly :  The apex line is running now, that help bring in some supplies, as a result of natural gas prices being higher. I think there was a drill bit response having formally been in that business they have prospects ready to drill typically when the prices are there recognizing that you get a decline curve in something like 60%, 80% depending upon which player and we're going to drill those wells when the gas prices are elevated like they will over the winter. And so I think some of this is a response with the drill bit. Overall it'sshaping up very nicely for the petrochemical industry though. Nils Wallin :  And then just on your crude slate, I know at one point you talked about having Western Canadian almost 20%. Would you remind us if that\u2019s still the number you are looking for and whether you've started to receive any shipments from Flanigan as yet? CLSA:  And then just on your crude slate, I know at one point you talked about having Western Canadian almost 20%. Would you remind us if that\u2019s still the number you are looking for and whether you've started to receive any shipments from Flanigan as yet? Jim Gallogly :  Yes, at this moment our crude slate is about 75% formed mostly Maya and a variety of other crudes, about 60% Canadian, 8% domestic. We expect that once Flanigan is running and at this point in time we are hoping late third quarter, early fourth quarter that we can get our slate up to about 35% Canadian. Obviously, today dependent upon dislocations in crude, we also did some work on our crude units so that we can have light crude capacity of about 50%. But we do hope to have more Canadian later in the year and that should help our refining results. Operator :  Next is David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ram Sivalingam :  Good morning. This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. Guys, obviously strong performance in O&P-EAI for the last two quarters given elevated operating rates, do you sort of view $300 million plus run rate for the back part of the year and into \u201815 is reasonable? Deutsche Bank :  Good morning. This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. Guys, obviously strong performance in O&P-EAI for the last two quarters given elevated operating rates, do you sort of view $300 million plus run rate for the back part of the year and into \u201815 is reasonable? Jim Gallogly :  We've obviously had a few quarters that have been in that range. You remember that EAI has about half of this portfolio that\u2019s pretty stable between our compounding business PB1, some of our joint ventures. There is an element of EAI that\u2019s nice and stable. We've now seen some contribution on a fairly steady basis from the more commodity oriented olefins and polyolefins business. Our inventories have been tight. We have been running very hard. We have had some operational bubbles there too and I think our results could have been better in the second quarter in Europe as well. We have got a nice structure there, our cost structure and we\u2019re monomer short, so we can run our crackers hard. We are doing everything we can to improve the feedstock slate. So Bob and his team keep delivering and we told him we'd like that to be a normal term. Operator :  Next is Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews :  Just a quick question. If you take out the issue at La Porte, what was your capacity utilization in the U.S. this quarter? Morgan Stanley :  Just a quick question. If you take out the issue at La Porte, what was your capacity utilization in the U.S. this quarter? Jim Gallogly :  We ran without La Porte at about 96% to 97% utilization. But if you remember that this was same company that ran over 100% utilization first solid year. So our expectations of ourselves are pretty high. Vincent Andrews :  And what -- if you know the delta between running at 96% to 97% versus over a 100%, is something within your control or is it just the way the quarter plays out? Morgan Stanley :  And what -- if you know the delta between running at 96% to 97% versus over a 100%, is something within your control or is it just the way the quarter plays out? Jim Gallogly :  We\u2019re running mechanical equipment but we work our maintenance hard and we\u2019ve got some people who know this business inside and out. I\u2019d like to say that our La Porte turnaround was not represented of what we typically do. Having said that, it was not for a lack of effort, we had people working amazingly hard to get all of that work done, it was a huge amount of work that we had in front of us given that we're reworking a bunch in towers and everything for else for this increasing capacity. So most of the industry can do a 95% something like that. It depends on the moment whether you include turnarounds are not in there, but we typically are operating more for percentage points about our competition. And when you look at some of the Salomon data and all of that, we benchmark extremely well. Operator :  Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Arun Viswanathan :  I guess I just wanted to ask a question about how you look at the industry and overall projects I mean [indiscernible] you guys with the brownfield and Dow with Freeport in a couple of years. I mean how are you looking at ethylene supply generally and is there any risk to being oversupplied in the U.S.? RBC Capital Markets :  I guess I just wanted to ask a question about how you look at the industry and overall projects I mean [indiscernible] you guys with the brownfield and Dow with Freeport in a couple of years. I mean how are you looking at ethylene supply generally and is there any risk to being oversupplied in the U.S.? Jim Gallogly :  Generally there is - at the same time, the ethylene capacity is being added, derivatives are being added. We are long ethylene, we have a portfolio of customers that we sell to, we're in constant discussions with them about the following -- the years following our expansions. And so for now we're feeling comfortable that we would be able to move the product. The United States is in such a nice advantage cost position that if we need to export, we can. And I think that\u2019s been a realization of all the competitors and gives them confidence to go ahead and expand capacity. Arun Viswanathan :  So just along those lines, can you just talk a little bit more about the potential for greater PE capacity addition as well you said you were considering a project there? RBC Capital Markets :  So just along those lines, can you just talk a little bit more about the potential for greater PE capacity addition as well you said you were considering a project there? Jim Gallogly :  We\u2019ve been talking about the polyethylene expansion with a brand new technology. We think that will be a very competitive line both in terms of the product that makes and the value it brings the capital cost. But also very importantly, this should help us a significant amount in our licensing efforts. We are going to build serial number 001 of the new technology and we\u2019re already very strong and low density polyethylene, the best in polypropylene in our view and this will add another leg to our technology stool that we think is very positive. Arun Viswanathan :  I am sorry, what\u2019s the potential timing on that? RBC Capital Markets :  I am sorry, what\u2019s the potential timing on that? Jim Gallogly :  Well, that project is supposed to come about 2017 middle part of the year as best we can predict at this moment. Arun Viswanathan :  And have you disclosed how much that\u2019s going to add to your PE capacity or\u2026 RBC Capital Markets :  And have you disclosed how much that\u2019s going to add to your PE capacity or\u2026 Jim Gallogly :  Yes, it\u2019s about 1 billion pounds; maybe we\u2019ve get more than that. Operator :  Next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open. Laurence Alexander :  I have two quick ones. Can give a sense for the rhythm of outages over the next four quarters, so how the back half compares to the first half of the year but also how you think this first half of next year might look by comparison? Jefferies:  I have two quick ones. Can give a sense for the rhythm of outages over the next four quarters, so how the back half compares to the first half of the year but also how you think this first half of next year might look by comparison? Jim Gallogly :  Laurence, are we talking about industry-wise or us? Laurence Alexander :  Just for yourself, it\u2019s just for yourself. Jefferies:  Just for yourself, it\u2019s just for yourself. Jim Gallogly :  Okay. Yes, we have BOTBA turnaround coming at Bayport. There is a couple of JV turnarounds coming but otherwise we expect to be running and I am hoping that we get ourselves lined out here shortly and that second quarter was an anomaly. Laurence Alexander :  And then I guess secondly just a longer term question. If single step conversion of methane to ethylene becomes viable I guess there is one of your competitors is doing a plant that was to come on next year. Is that something that would be significant for you in terms of a potential extra feedstock or how do you look at that. I know it\u2019s been talked about for a few decades but Jefferies:  And then I guess secondly just a longer term question. If single step conversion of methane to ethylene becomes viable I guess there is one of your competitors is doing a plant that was to come on next year. Is that something that would be significant for you in terms of a potential extra feedstock or how do you look at that. I know it\u2019s been talked about for a few decades but Jim Gallogly :  I haven\u2019t been too worried about that one way or the other at this point, there is always something new like that but it\u2019s a maybe, but been around the industry a long time and haven\u2019t seen many of those maybes turned into reality, so we\u2019ll see, I just don\u2019t know yet. Laurence Alexander : Okay, thanks. Jefferies: Okay, thanks. Jim Gallogly :  One of the things I failed to mention but I did in my prepared remarks is, we do have an HS unit at the refinery that will go down and turnaround too and that\u2019ll affect yield but not volume very much. Operator :  Next is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global, your line is open. Hassan Ahmed :  Morning, Jim. Question around the sustainability of these good results that you\u2019re seeing at O&P-EAI, you know good Q1, other good Q2 and as I took a look at your presentation slide for the segment, your July margins were even better on the ethylene side than Q2 margins. I was talking to one of your competitors in the US with a large sort of European asset base and they were telling me that they\u2019re running their ethylene facilities at 90% plus operating rates, so now is this a sign of call it an evolving sort of tightness in the broader cycle in your mind? Alembic Global :  Morning, Jim. Question around the sustainability of these good results that you\u2019re seeing at O&P-EAI, you know good Q1, other good Q2 and as I took a look at your presentation slide for the segment, your July margins were even better on the ethylene side than Q2 margins. I was talking to one of your competitors in the US with a large sort of European asset base and they were telling me that they\u2019re running their ethylene facilities at 90% plus operating rates, so now is this a sign of call it an evolving sort of tightness in the broader cycle in your mind? Jim Gallogly :  Well I think it\u2019s too early to say that. The rates have been higher you know our inventories are low in polymers, we\u2019ve been running our crackers hard, some of the product that has been coming into Europe from the Middle East is going to Asia. There have been some new duties and things like that but there has been a bit more strength in Europe than there\u2019s been in the past but it\u2019s still an oversupply condition in my mind still near bottom of the cycle type economics. But you know, one of the things that happened in July was naphtha prices came down and that always builds a little bit of margin so that\u2019s a positive. Hassan Ahmed :  Sure thing. Now can you guess to the methanol side of things, you know a couple of moving parts over there obviously? You know pricing had come down but I just noticed this morning, methane exports did their August prices which were flat with July level so seems to be some semblance of a bottoming out there, but then again you know towards the end of the year methane ex itself would bring online some incremental capacity. So how much sort of comfort do you have in your earlier sort of comment about a bottoming out or maybe even potentially an uptick in methanol pricing near term. Alembic Global :  Sure thing. Now can you guess to the methanol side of things, you know a couple of moving parts over there obviously? You know pricing had come down but I just noticed this morning, methane exports did their August prices which were flat with July level so seems to be some semblance of a bottoming out there, but then again you know towards the end of the year methane ex itself would bring online some incremental capacity. So how much sort of comfort do you have in your earlier sort of comment about a bottoming out or maybe even potentially an uptick in methanol pricing near term. Jim Gallogly :  So we\u2019ve got to watch what happens in natural gas pricing, but at this moment our sense is that we hit a bottom and we\u2019re headed a little bit up instead of down again, we\u2019ll see how the market develops, some -- we have to watch and see what happens in China too. If there\u2019s strength there or not strength later in the year, but we also could do a bit of self-help, we could have run better. Hassan Ahmed :  Fair enough, and just adding on to that, I mean Q1 seemed to be a bit of a quirky quarter where you had some [indiscernible] outages obviously, you know the real outages were there as well but did you see a fundamental sort of improvement in demand in Q2 and where we are right now call it in July for ethanol. Alembic Global :  Fair enough, and just adding on to that, I mean Q1 seemed to be a bit of a quirky quarter where you had some [indiscernible] outages obviously, you know the real outages were there as well but did you see a fundamental sort of improvement in demand in Q2 and where we are right now call it in July for ethanol. Jim Gallogly :  Well, for instance in VAM I think there\u2019s a structural change going on, you know there is some capacity taken down in Europe because it simply wasn\u2019t competitive on a cost basis and as a result of that the United States capacities have increased margins and able to ship to different places in the world. So VAM I think it\u2019s structural, acidic acid is pretty strong right now and again the same thing, if we run a bit better those businesses can do better. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Charles Nievert with Cowen and Company, your line is open. Charles Nievert :  Well just well, actually sort of a series, when you looked at the turnaround that you made at La Porte is that going to improve cost structure through that or is it just something versus where it was whenever you took it offline for getting the expansion that\u2019s going to come with it, or does it improve throughput on top of the expansion and the same would go for the other expansions as you're looking at ethylene does, is there going to be a little bit of a cost benefit once you make the turnaround? Cowen and Company :  Well just well, actually sort of a series, when you looked at the turnaround that you made at La Porte is that going to improve cost structure through that or is it just something versus where it was whenever you took it offline for getting the expansion that\u2019s going to come with it, or does it improve throughput on top of the expansion and the same would go for the other expansions as you're looking at ethylene does, is there going to be a little bit of a cost benefit once you make the turnaround? Jim Gallogly :  On a unit basis that will be a plus for us, because we got a 1.7 billion pound a year cracker already, we add 800 million, that\u2019ll make it one of the biggest most efficient crackers in the United States, we hold ourselves accountable in order to get our cost structure on a continuous basis lower. La Porte\u2019s in a good position to do that, Corpus the same thing, it\u2019s a different kind of turnaround, we\u2019re retubing furnaces and a variety of things down at Corpus, but both of those will be far more competitive assets.   We have Channelview that\u2019s already a very competitive asset; add a couple more furnaces there. We\u2019re very well positioned cost structure wise within our olefins assets in the United States, I didn\u2019t mention so far in this call our Midwest assets, Morris and Clinton, you probably have noticed that ethane prices have fallen rather rapidly there as well and they\u2019re extremely well positioned despite being smaller assets and they\u2019re running nice and hard. Charles Nievert :  Okay and just to reiterate on the refinery, the changes you\u2019re making with it, the turn you\u2019re going to take on the refinery, your throughput shouldn\u2019t change as the mix of products will, I mean for the time while you are doing that. Cowen and Company :  Okay and just to reiterate on the refinery, the changes you\u2019re making with it, the turn you\u2019re going to take on the refinery, your throughput shouldn\u2019t change as the mix of products will, I mean for the time while you are doing that. Jim Gallogly :  That\u2019s generally a proper statement. The yield structure will change, crude units should run hard but when you got some -- the next unit down, it will tuck the yield structure just a bit. Charles Nievert :  Okay, so you ran 258, you said you are now at nameplate on the refinery which is in the 260s, so given everything we should see an increase overall quarter-over-quarter in the refinery throughput number. The crack spread may change but\u2026 Cowen and Company :  Okay, so you ran 258, you said you are now at nameplate on the refinery which is in the 260s, so given everything we should see an increase overall quarter-over-quarter in the refinery throughput number. The crack spread may change but\u2026 Jim Gallogly :  Yes, depending upon where we are cracking, I mean we have gotten real close to 300,000 barrels a day with our refinery in some of the recent days, so we can run that thing harder now that we have done some work on the units there. So, we haven\u2019t been able to sustain above nameplate in any of the quarters but I certainly have a challenge out to the team to accomplish that. I think some of them are probably listening to this call. They have heard that before, they just heard it again. Operator :  P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar :  Jim, you talked about M&A and you said that you are looking at every opportunity. Are you willing to get into new chemistries of new molecules to what you have in your portfolio? Citigroup:  Jim, you talked about M&A and you said that you are looking at every opportunity. Are you willing to get into new chemistries of new molecules to what you have in your portfolio? Jim Gallogly :  I never ruled that out P.J. It is a possibility but it has to be the right value. I wouldn\u2019t say we are actively engaged in M&A activity. We evaluate everything that comes to market and see if it will make us better. One thing that we generally bring to the table is the ability to run assets and so even if it\u2019s different chemistry, we would have to look at it and see if we could contribute to improvement in whatever the structure is today. But again our focus remains on our share repurchases, ever increasing regular dividends and being shareholder friendly. P.J. Juvekar : And one quick question for Karyn, your accelerated repurchase as an option instead of buying your regularly? Citigroup: And one quick question for Karyn, your accelerated repurchase as an option instead of buying your regularly? Doug Pike :  I am sorry, P.J., this is Doug; you broke up in your question. P.J. Juvekar :  Sorry, do you see accelerated repurchase as an option instead of buying your stocks on a regular basis? Citigroup:  Sorry, do you see accelerated repurchase as an option instead of buying your stocks on a regular basis? Doug Pike :  You broke up again but you said do we see expanded stock purchases? Karyn Ovelmen :  Accelerated repurchases versus our buying today. Our view and approach to buyback really hasn\u2019t changed. We had a few more shares that we purchased this quarter than we have historically and that had to do with really just a bit of overlap as we were wrapping up the first 10%, 2013 authorization as we began executing on the second 10%, 2014 authorization.   So, we have outlined that capital strategy and we have been executing on that. Broadly speaking, nothing has really significantly changed in our view of the buyback and oil and gas ratio and our own operating fundamental to drive the strong cash flow remain in place. Our growth plans and actions should grow our future earnings and so we are in a position where we will continue to execute.  We won't speak prospectively as market factors could change, however today no change in our capital deployment policies and we'll continue to report what we have done each quarter on our activity. Operator :  And I am showing no further questions at this time. Jim Gallogly :  Well, thank you. Let me make a few final comments. We did have a record quarter almost $2 billion of EBITDA, earnings per share of $2.22. We completed a first 10% share buyback program. In the last six months, we've had $6.1 billion of share repurchases and dividends. While these are very good results, we could have done better.   We built a reputation for operational excellence, strong safety performance, environmental stewardship and reliability. We didn\u2019t deliver fully on that last leg. We had a long difficult turnaround at La Porte. It\u2019s completed. We are running above nameplate. Our people work incredibly hard but we didn\u2019t get it done within an acceptable timeframe. We had other operational bubbles. We will get ourselves back on track. We will continue to earn your trust and faith and our operational excellence and the markets have been kind, ethane prices are lower, the U.S. advantage is very strong at the moment. And we'll hopefully continue to surprise you to the upside. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect at this time.",

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today\u2019s presentation, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Doug Pike : Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's Third Quarter 2014 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning & Transactions.

And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time today until 11 PM Eastern Time on November 24th by calling 800-947-6627 in the United States and 1203-369-3974 outside the United States. And the pass code for both numbers is 3675. Now during today's call, we'll focus on third quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. And with that being said, I would like turn the call over to Jim. Jim Gallogly : Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our Website. Let\u2019s first take a look at Slide Number 4 during the third quarter we generated EBITDA of $2.04 billion. This led to income from continuing operations of $1.26 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.46. These results marked out best quarter ever and the second consecutive quarter of record results. I would like to summarize a few highlights. Olefins and Polyolefins Americas achieved EBITDA of almost $1.2 billion. The first time this has been achieved. European Olefins continued their above industry operating rates in the EAI segment again delivered EBITDA an excess of $300 million. During the quarter, we declared a regular interim dividend of $0.70 per share and repurchase to approximately 12 million shares. The strength of our results maybe best reflected in our last 12 months EBITDA and earnings. During the period, we generated EBITDA of approximately $7.2 billion, net income of $4.6 billion and had earnings per share of $8.49. We will discuss individual business details later in the call. Turning to slide number 5, you will see that our year-to-date safety performance is in line with results from the last several years and remains among the best in the industry. Operating safely is our first priority and always will be. Our goal is zero injuries and zero process incidents. I would now like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance. Karyn Ovelmen : Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Slide number 6, which charts third quarter and last 12 month segment EBITDA. As Jim said, we are pleased to be recording our second consecutive quarter of record results. Within the segments, the O&P Americas business established a new record EBITDA of nearly $1.2 billion. This marks the first time the business has exceeded $1 billion of EBITDA after almost $1 billion during second quarter. Compared to the second quarter, third quarter results benefited from strong ethane prices material cost and higher sale volumes. In O&P-EAI, our EBITDA of $323 million was $24 million higher than the second quarter. This quarter results continue to trend of strong earnings and further demonstrates the progress made by our European team. Intermediates and Derivatives EBITDA of $383 million declined $47 million versus the second quarter. Derivatives continued to benefit from healthy demand and constraint supply in the market to do competitor advantages. Our CP reserves decline primarily from lower volumes margins were compressed as a result of higher ethylene and persistently high bending raw material cost. Refining posted results in second quarters with EBITDA of $110 million or $27 million lower than the second quarter. In addition to a declining (inaudible) during the quarter are results for impacted by scheduled maintenance on our (inaudible) units. Now segment EBITDA of $41 million was lower than the second quarter due to lower licensing revenue. During the quarter we introduced $45 million non-cash lower cost to market inventory charge. This is generated from the decline in inventory evaluation. GAAP accounting requires is to flow through the P&L. There was somewhat majority of our inventory value based on 2010 market values. Slide 7, slide 7 provides the picture of our cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated $1.8 billion from our operations. Our cash and short term securities balance decreased by approximately $600 million. We devoted $1.6 million to share repurchase and in dividends. Capital expenditure remains consistent with our full year guidance of approximately $1.6 billion. Our cash and securities balance at the end of the quarter stood at $2.9 billion lower than the prior year by $1.5 billion as we continued to fund one of the largest share repurchase programs in the industry. Please turn to slide 8. During the past 12 months, we generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations and raised approximately $1 billion from bond issuances. We devoted $6.7 billion for share repurchases and dividends. Another $1.5 billion went towards capital investment with approximately 50% towards growth projects. Before I turn it over to Jim I also want to highlight that during the quarter we took steps to initiate a commercial paper program. This program is low cost way to increase flexibility within our cash management program. The program size enables borrowing up to $2 billion we anticipate starting the program at more modest levels. The commercial paper program has been rated by Moody and S&P at prime 2 and A2 respectively. I will turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results. Jim Gallogly : Thanks, Karyn. Let\u2019s discuss segment performance beginning on Slide number 9 with Olefins and Polyolefins Americas. Third quarter EBITDA was approximately $1.2 billion a record quarter and $175 million higher than the second quarter. This segment realized the LCM inventory charge. Olefins results grow the upside increasing by approximately $220 million from the prior quarter. Much of this upside was driven by higher ethylene prices resulting from tight industry supply driven by industry down time. During the third quarter, our average price of ethylene increased by $0.08 per pound versus an industry benchmark that increased by nearly $0.05 per pound. We managed this by capitalizing unfavorable marketing conditions and sold approximately 15% of our total ethylene volume at strong spot prices during the quarter. Additionally the cost of NGLs declined during the quarter. Ethylene accounted for approximately 75% of our ethylene production and an NGL represented 89%. Restart of our La Porte ethylene site following plant maintenance also contributed to the results to volume upside. Within Polyolefins, the polyethylene result increased by approximately $50 million.  The polyethylene spread over ethylene decreased by approximately $0.07 per pound. The spread declined was the result of the significant increase in our price of ethylene. Polyethylene prices increased late in the quarter leading to $0.01 per pound increase in the quarterly average price. Demand for polyethylene continued to be strong and volume increased approximately 9%. We are seeing the full benefit from the expansion completed earlier in the year. Exports represented approximately 14% of the volume. Polypropylene results improved by approximately $10 million and 11% higher for sales volume. We restarted our La Porte ethylene plant on July 20, falling at second quarter turnaround. You will recall that this restart was delayed and resulted in 20 days of down time during the third quarter. We estimate that this impacted the third quarter production and subsequent sales by approximately 100 million pounds following the restart, La Porte ran at 106% of its original capacity for the remainder of the quarter. Five other ethylene plants produced at 96% of capacity during the quarter. Late in September, our team started up the new furnaces at the La Porte plant. This adds 800 million pounds of annual ethylene capacity to our ethylene system or approximately 8%. This new capacity is the first in the series of expansions project that will add nearly 2.5 billion pounds to annual capacity. Current global economic and crude market volatility is limiting visibility on future industry conditions. So far fall in crude oil prices have not materially impacted the US market. We continue to benefit from ethylene industry down time resulting in tight industry conditions and depressed ethylene demand. NGL supply and inventory remains abundant and US ethylene industry continues to be significantly advantaged in the global market. However, the oil prices persists this should tight US Olefins margins overtime. It should also be mentioned that we typically see declines in polyolefins demand around the holiday season, wind and weather usually impacts NGL prices as well. Let's turn to slide number 10 and review performance in the olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia, and international segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $343 million an increase of $24 million from the second quarter. Olefins results improved approximately $35 million versus the second quarter. A lower cost of Naphtha was responsible for most of the margin increase. Approximately 55% of our ethylene production was sourced from advantage raw materials such as propane, butane and condensates. This was in line with the second quarter result. Overall, the feedstock advantage benefited results by approximately $70 million versus Naphtha. Year-to-date, we estimate that advantage feedstock has contributed approximately $180 million over Naphtha cracking. Our ethylene plants operated at approximately 95% of capacity significantly above reported industry rates and consistent with our second quarter rate. We believe the ability to run European asset hard with advantage feedstock is a distinct advantage over industry competitors. Polyolefins EBITDA results increased by approximately $15 million both polyethylene and polypropylene margins improved slightly. Seasonal demand and buying patterns contributed the volume declines of approximately 4%. In buying polypropylene compounds and polybutene-1 EBITDA declined by approximately $15 million. Volumes declined following typical seasonal patterns and other industry schedules. Results for joint ventures declined from second quarter by $7 million. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance contributed to the decline. October demand has been relatively consistent with the third quarter. However, it's difficult to experience holiday related slow down later in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, advantage feedstock or smaller contributor then during the summer months. We would expect to see a higher proportion of Naphtha cracking in this period. Now please turn to slide number 11 for discussion of our intermediates and derivative segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $383 million approximately $47 million lower than the second quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results increased by approximately $25 million versus the second quarter result. We continue to benefit from tight propylene oxide and derivative market conditions following down time at our European competitor introduced facility. PO derivative margins increased as result. Combined P&L and derivative volumes increased to approximately 4%. Intermediate chemicals performance declined by approximately $50 million. Result from lower by approximately $35 million. Margins declined as a result of rise in ethylene cost and persistently high benzene cost. Our methanol assets operated at 74% of capacity during the quarter as we continue to experience issues. We will conduct scheduled maintenance at the Channelview methanol plant during the first quarter of 2015. Additionally results were impacted by unplanned down time in our ethylene oxide facility. Neither asset operated standards. Oxy fuels results declines by approximately $20 million. Sales declines in favor of piracy for chemical sales. Decline in gasoline prices lowered margins. However, we benefited from an increased octane premium. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, thus far conditions in our propylene oxide and derivative businesses are relatively unchanged. We anticipate that the incident at the competitor's propylene oxide will continue to benefit us. During the fourth quarter of propylene glycol business typically benefits from the beginning of the winter season. Conversely, we typically experience the seasonal decline in our oxyfuel results. However, through last week, we have not yet experienced the decline. During the fourth quarter we are conducting plan maintenance on one of our Bay Porte POTBA plants. We have taken actions to minimize the fourth quarter impact. Let's move to slide number 12 for our discussion of refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $110 million a decline of $27 million from the second quarter. During the third quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $24.35 per barrel down $2.66 from the $27.01 spread from the second quarter. Due to favorable crude purchasing, our response in the refining spread declined by about half of the Maya benchmark. Crude throughput averaged 264,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. This throughput increase versus the second quarter contributed approximately $10 million to third quarter results. Fuel products yields declined versus the second quarter due to the scheduled hydrodesulfurization catalyst change that I mentioned during our last earning call. RIN cost was relatively unchanged versus the second quarter. Canadian elite crude represented approximately 25% of our third quarter throughput. Exports accounted for less than 5% of finished product fuel sales. October benchmark spread have averaged approximately $21 per barrel. Thus far RIN cost for the quarter a relatively unchanged. We anticipate receiving our first shipments of Canadian crude via the recently completed plant against south pipeline during the fourth quarter. There is no significant refining maintenance planned during the fourth quarter. Our technology segment EBITDA totaled $41 million or $30 million lower than the second quarter. This decrease in EBITDA is a result of lower licensing revenue during the quarter. This decrease represents typical fluctuation in the business and is not indicative of the change in underlying performance. Now please turn to slide number 13. During the third quarter, we delivered record EBITDA and earnings for the second consecutive quarter making this our best quarter ever. We also added second consecutive quarter making this our best quarter ever. We also added 800 million pound of annual ethylene capacity at our La Porte site. Additionally we continue to purchase shares under repurchase program purchasing approximately 12 million shares during the quarter. We finished the quarter with 504 million shares outstanding, a reduction of 73 million shares or approximately 30% since the program began. In the early of the fourth quarter, we have seen a significant decline in crude oil prices. Decline in crude oil prices typically impact global chemical prices and margins overtime. Of course, decline in crude oil also lower some of our costs so the net impact is difficult to estimate. Many markets seem tight at present. So that should mitigate some of the impact. During the fourth quarter we typically experienced seasonal declines in oxyfuels and polyolefins results. However, neither was significantly impacted during the first weeks of October. On our balance sheet headwinds, we should benefit from the recent ethylene capacity expansion at La Porte, we also expect the benefit from Canadian crude deliveries through the south pipeline. I would like to spend a few minutes now discussing the new projects that we are developing and announced during the quarter. The first is new green field POT bay facility to be located along the US gulf coast. We plan to deliver this plant by 2019. World scale facility will benefit from our proprietary POTBA technology and low cost natural gas based feedstocks. The project will increase our own PO capacity are approximately 35%. We also announced that we are evaluating to further expansion of Channelview ethylene facility. This project potentially adds another 550 million pounds per year ethylene capacity in 2017. Based on 2013 industry benchmark margins, we completed this project could add annual EBITDA in the range of $200 million. Engineering work is already underway. In total our US ethylene expansion projects will add approximately 2.5 billion pounds to our annual capacity. This is equivalent to a new olefins plant. Most of this additional capacity will be available about 2 years ahead of our competitors new green field plants and at a fraction of the cost. These advantages are significant. It must be remembered that even at recent gas prices US-based ethylene production continues to an advantage of approximately $0.30 per pounds over Naphtha base production according to IHS benchmarks. Time will tell out price stay at this depressed level but the fundamentals of story remain intact and a growth projects are already coming on line. I would also like to spend a minute discussing the new retirement. At the first day that I arrived at the company, I said that I didn\u2019t join the team to simply help chapter 11 instead, I joined help create the world's greatest petrochemical company. I truly believe this was an achievable goal with the right strategy and the commitment to excellence. We have been relentless in pursuing our back to basics strategy and we are realizing our goals. As you know our first priority was to achieve leading environmental health and safety performance and plant reliability. While we can always do better, we are now setting the benchmarks. We also worked to achieve financial strength. Today the company's balance sheet is very strong. The company is fiscally fit. Controlling costs is part of our culture. We pride ourselves on flat to falling cost every year. As for growth, we have talked a lot about being the early bird. We have proven that identifying and capturing market opportunities quickly. Our US expansion program is a great example of this. We are coming online sooner and that lower cost in our competition. We have robust expansion plans driven by our advantage positions. We have been taking steps over the last few years prepare for to retirement. Through the formation of the management board, five executives now help me running the company's day-to-day operations. They review the same proposals and we strategize and make decisions together. We have an excellent team at all levels in the organization. The team has achieved the goal as I said when I arrived at the company. By my score card, we may well be the best petrochemical company in the world. After five and half years of non-stop work, it's time for me to retire. Our supervisory board of directors has established a committee to choose my successor. I will continue to serve as CEO and chairman at the management board to ensure an orderly transition pending the selection of my replacement. I am confident that there will be a seamless transition. Allow me to conclude my prepared remarks by saying that our team is busy. We are on top of all the details. We recognized that while our past results may have been impressive, our future results are what really matters. We are committed to return -- to you our shareholders land of soil has a very bright future. We are now please to take questions Jessica. Operator : Our first question does come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets : Hey guys thanks for taking my question. Sorry about that. I guess maybe you can just help us understand some of the comments in the press release a little bit more detail and how you look at it given past history, so crude house come down, you acknowledged that. We expect over the next three or six months or year or so as far as ethylene margins is there a relationship that\u2019s really closely tight together or is it loser and then do you expect any kind of demand response into your products? Jim Gallogly : Okay. Let me take those kind of in order Arun. First oil price, having said that that happened quickly, oil prices sometime bounce right back so it's a bit difficult to tell at this point where oil prices will stabilize. They were much higher during much of the year so we will see what happens on that front. There is overtime a relationship between the price say WTI and the price of our products and that there will be some clearing prices in Asia and to certain extend in Europe. General rule of thumb is $10 a barrel, may compete overtime to about $0.05 a pound on Naphtha base ethylene. Having said that you also have to factor in supply-demand ratios at this point in time supply is extremely tight in United States. We have had as you saw from our extremely good O&P Americas results, very, very strong ethylene pricing and margins. Spot prices for ethylene were over $0.70 a pound at certain points in time and we sold 15% of our capacity into that market. A number of our competitors are still down and the market is still extremely tight. So under those conditions prices don't fall very quickly. Polyethylene seems to be quite tight right now and is not available like that. Orders don't get fill by some of our competitors. We have seen very strong demand, order books are full, so supply-demand in America seems pretty tight. In Europe is that same tightness seems to be there. We haven\u2019t seen cancellation of orders on the fall in crude prices like sometimes happens. It's seems to be pretty solid. I think because inventory levels have been very, very short in the convertors. So that kind of dynamic the market seems to be reasonably tight still. In Asia, prices have come down a bit but definitely not in line with fall in Naphtha prices at this point. Over time, we will see what happens in supply-demand. As I mentioned so far so good. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets : Okay and then \u2013 so I guess based on that point then, do you expect the operating rates globally to be -- in the sense that could there be any kind of demand response from lower oil flowing through to increased polyethylene demand globally overtime? Jim Gallogly : Well, demand rates could come down but usually that\u2019s seen in Asia. We don't have any capacity there. In Europe we ran at 95% olefins capacity the last two quarters in the row well above the industry operating rates have been kind of in the mid 80s and in United States we have all been running flat out, expect that to stop because we\u2019ve got a advantage so in terms of assets of company we are running hard and you\u2019ve seen that reflected in our numbers. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets : No, I\u2019m sorry I was just asking if you think that lower oil could actually opening to respond or resulting in increase demand -- for your products? Jim Gallogly : That\u2019s difficult to say, there is always that theory there that could increase demand a bit but in our sense it takes more money in consumer\u2019s pocket but again for our company we don\u2019t expect that to have much impact because we are running our assets hard already in Europe and the United States. We don\u2019t need that to continue that needs globally in Europe or Asia. Yes. We don\u2019t export much out of Europe and United States exports have been mostly South America, in Mexico about 15% so we are basically domestic in the sense of Europe production and U.S. production. So we don\u2019t need Asia to recover that much to do well. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks, I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Our next question does come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : Hi Jim, congratulations on a terrific run. Good luck on your retirement. Jim Gallogly : Thank you. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : I was curious what you thought about supply chain across your product lines and I guess maybe you can help me gauge the concern that your underline demand itself still probably reasonably good out there with the price drop in oil, there might be a lot of procurement managers out there looking at (inaudible) gaining some future discounts and so, do you think we could get a big head fake in the fourth quarter where destocking amplifies concerns about economic vitality or do you think most of the customer inventory levels are pretty lean and limited ability to do that. Jim Gallogly : Bob, I think the customer inventory should pretty lean. Usually, we see that pattern by now in the month and I have been watching order books very closely would have expected that in Europe first and we just haven\u2019t been seen in the United States because of the number of outages of Ethylene, Polyethylene has been particularly short and I didn\u2019t expect it here in the quarter we didn\u2019t see yet but so far we haven\u2019t been seen much of that and the volumes have resell in the Asia through the middle east and all have been moving pretty nicely so I just think there supply chain is tided at this point. Even of course U.S. economy is doing well and that should be a plus of sorts. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank.: Thank you. Good morning. Hey Jim, any concern that oil moves lower it will impact -- in U.S. which will impact and propane supply down the road? Jim Gallogly : Well, there is always some chance of that. I have sent lot of my career in the oil business but you have to recognize that lot of these rigs already been booked for multiple months and sometimes years, I expect they will continue to drill if you look at the rig counts and all -- kind of steady as she goes, there is always a little curtailment as people run over the capital budget at the end of the year but then they\u2019re starting to spend and gain hard at beginning of the year. Gas prices aren\u2019t that different where they have been and oil prices should down some but I think most of that drilling continues and still looks okay as far as we can see. And of course a bigger question is the people think this is a short term thing or longer term thing. Final plan I want to make is that as far as ethane goes we are very, very long you have seen propane prices come down and there is still 30% ethane rejection going on so we are nothing worried about that. David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank.: Can you just on the refinery how should we think about the impact of flying in self and crude on your refinery margins? Jim Gallogly : Yes, well, typically sell for a significant discount even after transportation, sometimes equity $7 to $10 a barrel to get ultimately we would expected that volume of Canadian crudes out to 30%-35% we just have to see how quickly we can ramp it up but it should be a nice plus for us. The $65 a barrel and how -- to give you an example where this today. David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank.: Very good, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMC, your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Chase : Thanks very much. I guess my first question is for Karyn, the interest cost came down from $89 million to $79 million sequentially and the tax rate was relatively low at around 25.5%, how did you do that and are the interest, the lower interest payments sustainable? Karyn Ovelmen : Interest expense yes, couple of things there one is increased interest income associated with our marketable securities and we saw that earlier than the year as we would have been on the three months investment cycle to increase our returns associated with our cash sitting on our balance sheet. So that was about $3 million of that, I know there are close to $4 million related to our swaps that we entered into periods. So essentially the fixture floating interest rates convert fixed rate debt into floating debt, capitalize on the current low interest rate environment. So that overall impact from that is about $4 million and then from a tax perspective really it was of our earnings so those associated with non-U.S. earnings in terms of the mix that we had coupled with that was increase in the text benefit associated with some of our own internal financing and structuring and then of course some impact.  Our tax rate for the full year 2014 is expected to be approximately 27% and so that\u2019s decline in the third quarter when we look at that fourth quarter you can anticipate moving up to around 28%. Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Chase : Okay. And then from my follow-up, I was wondering Jim if you thought that there was a difference OpEx strategy in this oil price decrease and that we haven\u2019t really seen announced cuts in production and I was wondering if you thought that or I was wondering if you thought there was a difference in the strategy and what might be the motivation behind the difference in the strategy, it\u2019s a worst one? Jim Gallogly : I\u2019m not sure, sides on that but have been reported previously that Saudi Arabia would likely cut production in the event of price falls and there was press to the effect and then more recently there is a little news about maybe some production cuts, so I\u2019m little uncertain exactly where they are going to go, one thing to remember is that a dollar has been increasing and strengthened we have to look at relative bind power that they get from say $80 crude versus a $100 crude in the past when the dollar was weaker. So there is some about that -- in the price otherwise we just have to see what happens all the time, I think sometimes it\u2019s more important to watch what happens and what\u2019s\u2026 Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Chase : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, good morning. Jim you\u2019ve recently announced another expansion at Channel View the \u00a3550 million for 2017. I was just wondering if you could comment on how you think the returns for that expansion will compare to your earlier expansion at Channel View in \u201915 or perhaps the La Porte expansion there you just completed and what are the key assumptions as it relates to two energy and cost that you are breaking into those expansion projects? Jim Gallogly : Yes Kevin, I think you will see that that project also has extreme and strong returns, I saw another competitor quoted number for an expansion just in the last week or so and the number surprised that how high it was we are doing some retrains and pretty simple work on the backend of the Channel View asset the things that we have done at La Porte and proved the concept, so fairly inexpensive de bottleneck obviously the work that we have done at La Porte and the earlier worked done on Channelview\u2019s furnace expansions where we actually have additional purchase to at each location, so this is different, this is kind of a debottleneck of the backend and some pretty simple pounds at a very nice robust cost. Now, we have to wait for a turn around, the engineering is in progress that\u2019s why the 2017 date we already had these ideas in the past but the major turnaround to make it cost effective or optimally effective having said all of that I\u2019m sure like bringing on that \u00a3800 million once like we just did so that was great timing and we\u2019ll be able to move that product in the market add some beautiful margins and spot price is still high. Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : As a second question Jim, what you see your outlook for propylene and derivatives like polypropylene, let\u2019s say over the next 6 to 12 months, it seems like there is a lot volatility there those on propane sheets dark and then monomer and the polymer just curious as to what is driving that in your view and how sustainable it is? Jim Gallogly : Polypropylene margins are kind of up and down, the volumes have improved from time to time. We moved out of our flux unit, our metathesis unit and the spot sales for a while because there made somewhat sense at the high prices and then now we are back in to double-dimmer mod and making propylene because at the propylene price. So we are very flexible on that kind of thing and knowing response to markets, we used to have a tagline of being the world\u2019s largest polypropylene producers but you can see that that is earnings one where the other we have a lot of volume but that\u2019s not with no sense, I would like to comment on propane a bit that in the crack again the prices have come down, it\u2019s a positive story but I have said in the past we are not continue to say the propane will overtime continue to modulate around cost accrued inviolate advantage right now and doesn\u2019t pay to exporters much of it at this moment in time that\u2019s there is plenty of export capacity in -- and some of that increasing, so propane isn\u2019t the big story I think. I think it\u2019s still cheaper thing but propane from time to time contributing. And we did say that propane is in our crack in the last two quarters in Europe because it does get exported there and does help us on a relative basis so compared to naphtha. Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open. Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies: Good morning. Quick question on the use of stocks in Europe. You had a pretty good track record for the last couple of quarters, is there how much further can you push that or is this sort of the run rate in terms of the amount that you can shift over the mix? Jim Gallogly : What we are doing the few things, so minor capital projects in Europe that bump add up a little bit more, it\u2019s more favorable in the summer months then reduced in the winter months in our propane is really cheap right now some of that can extend down and there some exports happened that\u2019s the plus for us so right now it\u2019s been 35% or so which is pretty significant. I think it\u2019s a nice plus and a biggest story there that was differential operating rates we are short monomer in our system so we are running extremely hard at 95% of main played and that much money in the bank. Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies: And then is there as part of dislocation happening with the arrival of the (inaudible) to secure longer term discounts or should these be viewed as sort of conditions strange your margins will move with that. Jim Gallogly : Yes, I think in the United States at this point in time there isn\u2019t a need to try to do that, in Europe so far we have not done long term contracts with regard, certain deals sometimes with foreign producers because they recognize that it could get little bit competitive they would like to secure market outlets and so we have been able to negotiate some deals there for Europe but longer term we are kind of moving with the market more than not. Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies: Thank you. Operator : Our next question does come from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Thank you Jim. On the gulf coast there is a lot of new ethylene capacity announced but not enough polyethylene capacity. So do you expect ethylene to go long in maybe profit shift to polyethylene? Jim Gallogly : P.J. I don't really think there is going to happen. We look at our balances all the time. We are long ethylene, we are obviously adding some additional polyethylene capacity. We expanded Matagorda. We have got the new announced billion pound plant. We will look at who is trying to buy from us. Some of those people who are out there announcing new plants are really trying to negotiate different supply contracts, not all of that is going to come on. We are watching the balances, we are trying to make sure that we are in the right spot on all of that but I think we are well positioned. I don't think all of that is going to move the polyethylene. Historically it hasn\u2019t done that. I have been in the business a lot of years. I know I am retiring now but I don't expect that to change dramatically. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. And one of the reasons you didn\u2019t build a new cracker was that labor was tight on the gulf coast but now that you have announced a new PO plant, which would presumably use a same labor force so why PO plant and then can you tell us how much it's going to cost you? Thank you. Jim Gallogly : Yes, I am not going to give an estimate right now because we haven\u2019t finalized those numbers. We have preliminary numbers but I am not ready to release those. Your point is valid that that labor market is still going to be tight but as you probably seen PO is a extremely tight, and well this POTB plant won't have the margins of our really early ethylene expansions the margins look very nice. The other thing to remember is that it's a POTBA plant. And while PO is going to be short we think and obviously very short right now because this is supply by competitors the TBA molecule going into the oxyfuels we think is going to be extremely important. That's volume of octane becomes more and more important and the margins have been good. We have customers who are demanding that extra product and so we feel pretty good about it. Also point out that a lot of that olefins construction 17, 18 we are going to be in that part way on this plant but we are bit on the back end of that with the 2019 so we will try to modularize few other things to keep the cost down but yes we are building it in the time when labor cost are going to be little bit higher. P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup: Thank you. Operator : Our next question does come from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Your line is open. Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. The first is in this lower oil environment, assuming that oil kind of stays where it is does that change to value you are seeing in repurchasing shares over the next few years? Jim Gallogly : Nils, first I am not going to assume it stays that low. What happens on that, it's fairly a short list phenomena so far and we will see how that develops overtime but we still have a significant ethylene advantage in the United States, obviously our shares came down fairly dramatically with the reduction of oil price. So I think it's even better buying opportunity, we like our share repurchase program and we think we have a bright future. So our (inaudible) continuing with that. Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA: Understood. Thanks. And then just with respect to the La Porte plant coming on stream, and then the normal sort of seasonal weakness one we have seen in the fourth quarter, how would those two play out with is the La Porte capacity enough to offset it or just offset it 50%, is their way to quantify what you see the impact of the plant in the fourth quarter. Jim Gallogly : Well we expect to be able to sell every pound of ethylene that we can make. We have been able to demonstrate that\u2019s the case in the last couple of years and polyethylene seasonally comes down in United States but we have also been able to sell those pounds so sometimes it impacts margins so far as of today the market is extremely tight in the United States so we will see what happens later on price starts to show up in our margins but so far so good. Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA: Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities : Yes. Good morning and congratulations on another record and it sounds as if the first three weeks in October we are still operating it at record margin levels for the business. Jim in following up in your point, does oil stay down here, another industry leader recently opined it getting back to $100 within the year and if that\u2019s actually the case, do we get back to margins kind of where we are right now. Can you, what your thoughts are on this period of market profitability, is it something that could be sustained back when we get oil back to triple digits? Jim Gallogly : Frank, the first, I won't be so bold to predict oil price, I wasn\u2019t very good when I was an EMP guy and I probably haven't got any better, when you look at the track record oil has been more above 100 and under in recent time. So we will see where that goes. In terms of where the margins are in the third quarter we had exceptionally tight supply-demand issues competitors that had unplanned averages that were significant, that continues into the fourth quarter. In addition there has been some turnaround activities. There is a lot of capacity down right now and so those of us who can run are great spot prices, we will be getting into contract discussions, contract price discussions shortly but again supply, demand is very, very tight. It's for good margins and contract has been still considerably under spot. There \u2013 it's good supply dynamics coming into the fourth quarter in the United States so your first part of the comment about how we are doing so far in the quarter that kind of record level, so far so good. Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities : All right. Terrific and 15% of sales of ethylene on the spot market seem very high or rather high to me. You mentioned before, unit and then I guess from La Porte starting up that maybe didn't have those contracted, can you put that 15% into perspective for us. Where do you typically on that and in future times where margins are good, can you get back to that or do you believe that you are going to have your volumes already contracted for? Jim Gallogly : Well, we don't have all of our volumes contracted for. We have got the ability to flex with that Metathesis unit and so we spun that thing around early quickly into the spot market because there were some people desperate for pounds and we are happy to sell them those pounds so 15% was pretty bold. We didn\u2019t get that extra 800 million pounds until the end of the quarter. And so it didn\u2019t have that much impact on the quarter itself. That's kind of the fourth quarter item. Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question does come from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John McNulty - Credit Suisse : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So with regard to some of the cold olefins facilities that are still playing in Asia at this point can you comment as to your thoughts on if oil prices do stay at this levels, how much jeopardy are those projects potentially in and does it really change how we should be thinking about the ability for some of that capacity to come into the markets? Jim Gallogly : Well, that's very, very high capital cost production and then once it's on, it does have some feedstock advantage in theory. The oil prices you have to double think about whether that make sense or not, and of course always remember that there is a lot of capacity going in the United States. It's still very, very significantly advantage that that's going to compete on the coast. Some of that stuff is more inland. So we will see how that all develops but it's people a bit of pause in China developing, projects at that kind of capital cost and even on the export of ethane you got to go build ships and do all of that and you start looking at that dynamic, it's better to have assets like we do that are cheap capital that are coming on now that are most guarantee that brilliant return. I think that strategy is working well for us. John McNulty - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks and then maybe one follow-up, it does seem like the US projects which is still pretty much all the huge economics even with oil where it is but do you see any chance that because of the drop in oil, that maybe they rush to get all these projects up which is causing some of the inflation that you are talking about earlier in the call maybe that rush subsides a little bit, maybe drawing out the cycle little bit longer and also maybe putting a little bit of relief into the labor and engineering markets how should we think about that? Jim Gallogly : Well, the projects are already started. They will still be trying to get those projects done as quickly as possible and I don't think it's more to oil price because again folks who do these kinds of projects aren\u2019t looking at three week or even three month type oil price. So they are more interesting what they view the longer term to be. So they are going to continue to progress those projects as quickly as they can but having said that cost are definitely higher and productivity definitely lower. So we will just see how quickly they get them on stream. We are feeling very good about having the Porte running now and couple of furnaces at Channelview or you know coming along very, very nicely with the push part of the year start-up and corporate is moving along nicely. So being early is a good thing. I think the project is as I have said before, that others have announced maybe a bit later than people expected to definitely more expensive than they originally forecast. John McNulty - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks very much for the thoughts. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Thanks very much. Thanks for taking my question. Jim could you talk about where you see global operating rates for ethylene today and then you normalize, averages coming back what do you think will be in 2015 and 2016? Jim Gallogly : Well, today I think it depends on the geography in the United States if you can run your running but people haven\u2019t been running very well. I have seen some industries number that have an eight better in front of them instead of nine and that just shows how capacity has been down. We have been running our system obviously the 106 -- 96 we are running hard in United States that should continue well into the future. I don't expect that to change with advantage we have. In Europe, I think people in the mid 80s is about right. In Europe at this moment, time depending up on which region you are in, is bit short here and some plan averages and some turnaround. So it's recently tight right now compared to where it's been. We have been in the high 90s in Europe because we are in Asia 80% kind of level maybe a little higher than that. So we will just see. Next year, we will see how the economy goes and that could push it up some I have seen some people forecasting getting in the 90% range. We will just see. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : So your view is not that we are going to wind up in the 90% plus range over the next couple of years, taking wait and see approach. Which is it? Jim Gallogly : It depends on the economy. If the economy start to come back you will see that numbers soon and if it doesn\u2019t its couple of years away probably. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : And maybe last question on this, what is the right GDP going forward? Jim Gallogly : The right multiplier let me ask you who is running, you know it's the big issue is still how many plants are down that aren\u2019t expected to be down in United States (inaudible) that margin really is. We have seen spectacular margins lately and there is a continued that probably not but having said that it continues to be strong you bet. I am not going to issue single number out there and say that's about what it's going to be but we still say it's very, very strong and I think you should assume that we will have that same correlation the global GDP on rates that we have seen in the past. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks very much and congratulations again on your retirement. Jim Gallogly : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes, and congratulations on your retirement as well. Jim in Europe, IHS chemical recently talked about raw materials being in free fall, do you think in November you will pick up some margin in Europe because of the rapid drop in raw material cost and then in December, if volume slow will you run full out even if the inventory pull down you have enough cost advantage you think in Europe to keep your crackers running no matter what. Jim Gallogly : Well, whenever Naphtha prices and other feedstocks fall, we typically see some margin expansions because the way prices settle at the beginning of the month, I think recently there have been some indications that maybe there could be a better margin expansion because of tightness in certain of the hubs. We don't get the crackers much typically crackers much of the favorite feedstock in the winter months as we do in the summer. So we will see how that goes. We are watching the polymer volumes but as I said, so far those are holding up and as of this moment time we are running our crackers hard still. There is some seasonality toward the end of year at the holidays, that's very, very typical in Europe. I would be surprised if that didn\u2019t happen again. But so far everything is shaping up okay. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. Thank you. Jim Gallogly : I am afraid we are just about out of time so I think we will just take one more call. I apologize to those we couldn\u2019t take today. Operator : Our last question does come from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Your line is open. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Morning Jim. You know in the quarter there were a couple of unplanned, particularly within the IND side of things and yield facility and you also talked about Methanol facility as well. Could you just give us a sense of the EBITDA impact of that? Jim Gallogly : Yes Hassan, PO has a good quarter volume strong, and pricing solid because of the competitor outage. That's going to continue for a while. People expect that to be well in the next year if not the whole of next year and so that well for the PO business. Frankly we can run up to our standards and some of the other assets. We restarted the methanol plant and I mentioned that we ran it at about 75% operates, this is the company who likes to set benchmark in most of our assets and so far that asset has not delivered. We have got to turn around plan for early next year to fix some of that. We have had an SGR issue kind of about every quarter we have to take a little bit of down time. We are working on permanent fix on that and then we had some issues on the methanol unit. So we hope to line ourselves out on that run. The EO unit had an issue too. We had some unexpected down time. That unit has been extremely reliable up to this point in time but we had an exchange, we did some pretty clever things to get it back on line. It's running now and so that's corrected itself for now. But that down time in addition to the price fall is why we missed. So it\u2019s a bit tough but there is some capacity also down in Europe which it should snug it, we will see what happens on benzene, olefins prices has gone up. Good thing for us generally but it hurt out margins. So I would expect, frankly in my view had a miss because we didn\u2019t run very well and that's who we are. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Fair enough. Fair enough. And, recently spoke at an event where I guess you were asked about your views and I think there was some confusion with some people thinking that you sounded more positive, some people sort of thinking to the contrary. So could you just tell us where you are in terms of process? Jim Gallogly : Yes we are still studying. I don't \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say I am more positive, less positive on it at all. I think obviously the transaction that's been in the market has performed well. We are different company of different tax position, different size, variety of things that influence that but we are watching studying some more and obviously we can't file anything today but we have had and the team is busy at work making sure we understand all the implications of the potential and we\u2019ll go from there. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Superb. Thanks so much Jim. Jim Gallogly : Okay. Let me make a few closing comments then. We just finished another great quarter of best ever and what we know we have oil price volatility, we know what to do about that. For instance in the United States we had the blow out and spot prices we step quickly into that market there shut down our flux unit and put a lot of cash in the bank we historically have operated our assets very close to name plates sometimes you recall that we ran our crack which is over 100% for whole annual period about a year ago, we know how to control our cost it\u2019s absolutely part of whom we are as a company we talk about flat to following cost every year. We\u2019ve been early in delivering our growth projects if it related it\u2019s by weeks it\u2019s not by months it\u2019s not by years and we bringing those projects in at a point in time that\u2019s wonderful in terms of margins. We\u2019ve got a great balance sheet, we\u2019ve been buying back our shares, we think there is another buying opportunity today with the prices that are down. And so we feel extremely good about our future. I have announced my retirement I\u2019d like to thank all of you for the support that you have given me through the years, I commented that I came to help to create the best petrochemical company in the world, we are getting there. A bit more work to do but we are getting there. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating, you may disconnect at this time.",

But finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 3 PM Eastern Time today until 11 PM Eastern Time on March 3 by calling 866-407-9260 in the United States and 203-369-0614 outside the United States. And the pass code for both numbers is 4558. During today's call, we'll focus on fourth quarter and full year of 2014 performance, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I\u2019d like to call your attention to the non-cash Lower of Cost or Market inventory adjustment that we recognized during the fourth quarter. This charge is driven by the use of LIFO accounting, our 2010 fresh start accounting as we entered the public markets and the recent declines in pricing for many of our own aw materials and finished goods inventories. And Karyn will discuss that adjustments later in the call, but the comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impact of this LCM inventory charge. With that being said, I now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thanks, Doug. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining our earnings call. I am pleased to be here today conducting my first earnings call as the CEO of LyondellBasell. I am surely honored with along our stakeholders and I am excited about what the future holds for our great company. I joined LyondellBasell five years ago in order to be part of the team that would deliver one of this industry\u2019s great transformations under Jim Gallogly\u2019s leadership; we\u2019ve put in place a strong work as basic philosophy and a solid foundation. I am grateful for his support and mentorship over the past five years. I\u2019m also grateful for the hard work and support of all my colleagues at LyondellBasell. We are enormously proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together thus far. We have an excellent safety record, world-class assets, outstanding operational efficiency, a strong balance sheet and exciting growth projects underway. It\u2019s my mission to build on this success and ensure LyondellBasell continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers and pure leading value to our shareholders. I am taking over as CEO of a company that is well positioned to excel under all circumstances. This company has an excellent foundation upon which we will build. I\u2019ll talk more at the end of this call about my approach, philosophy and strategy, but for now I would like to discuss the 2014 results. As Doug mentioned at the start of this call, a set of presentation slides accompanying the call is available on our website. Let\u2019s take a look at Slide number 4, and review a financial highlights. The fourth quarter set a record for the period and marked the third consecutive quarter of record results with EBITDA of $2.1 billion and earnings per share of $2.48. Our EBITDA results were $578 million higher, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Our annual results also set a new record. For the year, our income from continuing operations was $4.7 billion or $8.92 per share. The chart on the bottom of the page highlights the strength of our earnings and the annual growth realized over the past several years. Within our portfolio, the fundamental drivers of our performance were unchanged. Both Olefins, Polyolefins Americas and EAI segments again achieved record results in 2014. The Intermediates and Derivatives segment continued to be a strong stable performer generating approximately $1.5 billion of EBITDA in each of the past three years. Our Refining segment EBITDA more than doubled and the Technology segment continued to generate steady and strong earnings. I will speak more about the performance of each segment later in the call, but I first wanted to highlight a few of our 2014 accomplishments. If you turn to Slide number 5 of the presentation, I\u2019ll begin with environmental, health and safety performance. Those of you who have followed us know of our commitment in this area. I want to assure you that under my leadership, LyondellBasell\u2019s focus on environmental, health and safety performance will not cage. This has been and will remain our first priority; our outstanding track record can be seen in these charts. As they were last year, our results are consistent with top and solid performance. Over a five year period, our total recordable incident rates is down approximately 50% and our environmental and process safety incident rates have declined by approximately two-thirds. While these numbers represent good progress, they are not zero, which is our ultimate objective. Performance in this area protects our people, our assets, and the communities in which we operate. We will continue to strive for perfection and this will remain our number one focus and priority. Turning to Slide number 6, we\u2019ve outlined some of our key financial and operating accomplishments. First, let\u2019s cover our financial accomplishments. Profits during 2014 surpassed last year\u2019s record earnings. We generated $6 billion in cash flow from operations while returning $7.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We purchased more than 63 million shares and increased our dividend by 17%. Our finance team took advantage of a favorable lending market by issuing $1 billion in 30 year bonds at favorable rates and we initiated a commercial paper program. Turning to operating accomplishments, you\u2019ll note our outstanding operating rates. The US Ethylene operating rate remains near our nameplate capacity for the third consecutive year when normalized for the La Porte turnaround and expansion. Our European Ethylene operating rate of 95% was 12 percentage points higher than the industry average. Our propylene oxide and refinery rates also improved year-over-year. In addition to our excellent operating rates, we increased our feedstock flexibility enabling more production from advantaged feedstocks. In 2014, approximately 90% of our US Ethylene production was sourced from NGLs and approximately 53% of our European Ethylene production came from advantaged feeds. At our refinery, approximately 10% to 15% of our production was sourced from lower cost Canadian crude and during the second half of the year, the refinery operated at 99% of capacity. As you know, we\u2019ve always emphasize cost control. For the sixth consecutive year, we offset inflation and maintained flat underlying fixed costs. During 2014, we executed on our growth program. In addition to operating the Channelview Methanol plant, for the full year following a free start, at the end of 2013, we delivered two significant growth projects. The first major ethylene expansion in our growth program was completed at La Porte during last summer. This project brought online an additional 800 million pounds of annual ethylene capacity. We also commissioned an additional 200 million pounds of polyethylene capacity at our Matagorda site. Together these projects contributed approximately $80 million to 2014 EBITDA. During 2015, we expect to realize the full year benefits from both projects. Along with completing these projects, we began construction on two other ethylene expansions in the US and we are actively developing another. We also announced that we are in the process of developing plants for our new propylene oxide plant. Slide number 7 summarizes the impacts of our growth programs. Overall, we will increase our US ethylene capacity by 25% and global propylene oxide capacity by approximately 35%. Let\u2019s turn to Slide number 8 and look at some of the metrics that drove our performance in 2014. Off the top of the page reported our key volumes. I want to focus your attention on our ethylene production. Over the past several years, our cracker operations have been strong and we\u2019ve been able to operate in both regions above industry average rates. Our US data represents production after operation of our flux unit which converts ethylene into propylene. Taking into account, this ethylene consumption and our plant turnaround downtime, our US crackers again operated near our nameplate capacity of approximately 10 billion pounds. In Europe, our crackers operated at 95% of nameplate capacity, a new record for those facilities. On the charts along the bottom of the page, you see a summary of product margin to Spreads. The indexed chart represents our internal data while the others represent industry benchmarks. The charts on the left highlights strength of the US ethylene cans and our performance and then our outperformance in Europe as we increased feedstock, flexibility and operating rates during 2013 and 2014. On the right-hand side, we have product MTBE, and refining industry spreads. MTBE continued to deliver solid spreads during 2014. In refining, the industry Maya 2-1-1 Spreads has been fairly steady. While we have pursued internal improvements in our operation and flexibility to adjust to the changing crude oil environment, overall these charts provide a good perspective of the margin and volume factors that helped to generate record earnings during 2014 and in each of the last three years. Perhaps most important, we captured the value that a strong market afforded through our solid operations and advantaged feedstock positions. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance. Karyn Ovelmen : Thanks Bob. Before I review our cash performance, I thought I should help you understand the lower cost for market inventory adjustment or LCM as that it\u2019s somewhat unique. Please turn to Slide number 9. The simple pie chart has been added to help the reason for the non-cash LCM adjustment. This adjustment impacted our reported EBITDA numbers in the fourth quarter by $715 million and by $760 million for the full year. While this may be unique to us and that\u2019s highlighted by our competitors, it must be remembered that we use LIFO accounting and our balance sheet is fabulous during mid-2010 when we reentered the public markets, but whereas at this time that our inventory was valued at market prices. Crude oil was approximately $85 and natural gas was at $4 per MMBTU. On the right, we have included and issued prices for key raw materials and products. In the graph, you will see that at the end of each of the subsequent years crude oil ranged higher than $85 price in 2010. The market value of our crude oil in trade was like in excess of the 2010 value. With the rapid decline of crude oil, the raw materials and finished goods pricing during the second half of 2014, GAAP accounting requires us to adjust the value of inventory held on our balance sheet show lower market prices. This is what has generated a large non-cash inventory adjustment. If you seen the tables, there have been further declines in both raw materials and products during January. If these conditions persists, we would expect to record additional LCM adjustments during the first quarter. Please turn to Slide number 10, as Bob already mentioned, this has been a record-setting year for both EBITDA and operating income. Olefins & Polyolefins \u2013 Americas EBITDA reached $4.2 billion for the year and grew more than $1 million per quarter. For Olefins & Polyolefins EAI exceeded $1.4 billion for the year, a mark achieved very far away just a few years ago. This performance was driven by our differentiated position and internal actions of Olefins & Polyolefins businesses. Intermediates & Derivatives continued to deliver stability to the portfolio and segment earnings were up approximately 4% versus 2013. While we often focus on the results of Olefins & Polyolefins \u2013 Americas given its size, it is important to note that Olefins & Polyolefins EAI and Intermediates & Derivatives together generated EBITDA totaling nearly $3 billion. As it\u2019s particularly impactful as only $432 million of capital is needed to support the operations resulting in excellent cash flow. Refining also contributed as EBITDA more than doubled from the very difficult 2013. Please turn to Slide number 11, which provides the picture of our cash generation needs. During 2014, we generated $6 million cash from operations. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $1 billion at an average coupon rate of 4.875%. Our commercial paper borrowings ended the year at $252 million. The cash and short-term securities balance ended the year at $3 billion. On Slide 12, you can see the $6 billion in cash from operations. This is $1.2 billion higher than 2013. This cash generation has allowed us great flexibility. And for the capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion during 2014 allowing us to progress our growth projects. We have also continued our commitment to return cash to our shareholders and you can see the significant step forward that was made during 2014. During the last 12 months, we have returned $7.2 million for our shareholders repurchasing over 63 million shares in the process. During the past four years, we have paid dividends of $7.8 million and devoted $7.7 billion to share repurchases. To-date, we have repurchased approximately 91 million shares since the share repurchase program began in 2013. This equates to approximately 16% to the total shares outstanding at the time the program will be initiated. As you may recall, we are authorized to purchase 10% of our shares before the end of October 2015. Herein, we have ample cash to acquire remaining 20 million shares under this authorization. We continue to remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. There has been no change to our capital deployment or our financial policies in this regard. So this is the beginning of the year, it is that time we\u2019ll address some of your 2015 modeling questions. Regarding capital, we are currently planning to spend approximately $1.6 million during 2015. This spending level progresses with our base statements and growth programs. Approximately 40% is targeted toward our growth program. During 2015, major projects had good turnaround at the refineries, two propylene oxide facilities and ChannelView methanol. Majority of the growth spending will be divided between the ChannelView and Corpus Christi ethylene expansion. ChannelView expansion should be online during the second quarter and Corpus Christi is now expected to begin production during the second quarter of 2016 following a first quarter turnaround. Our cash interest expense is expected to be approximately nearly $369 based on $6.8 million of long-term debt at an average rate of approximately 5.3%. We also expect to have $10 million of interest on our short-term facilities as well as an estimated $4 million per quarter of non-cash amortization. During 2014, we executed $2 million of fixed to floating interest rate swaps and $2 billion of dollar to euro cross currency swaps. At year end 2014 conditions, we expect these positions to reduce our interest expense by roughly $60 million in 2015. However this will fluctuate with underlying movements of interest and currency rates. I look forward to optimize our interest rate mix with interest rate swaps. We also expect to continue our short-term investment strategy which is based on ensuring the safety and prioritization of our investors. This strategy provided over $30 million in interest income in 2014. However this line of income changed depending on the level of interest rates and cash that is invested. And depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.2 billion during 2015. We plan to make regular pension contributions that totaled approximately $110 million and estimate pension expense of approximately $55 million. We currently expect a 2015 effective tax rate of approximately 26%. The cash tax rate is expected to be somewhat lower. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bob for a further discussion of our business results. Bob Patel : Thanks Karyn. As mentioned previously in my discussion of business results will be in regard our underlying business results excluding the impacts of this LCM inventory charge. Let\u2019s discuss segment performance beginning on Slide number 13 with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas. Excluding the LCM charge, fourth quarter EBITDA was $1.3 billion, $72 million greater than the third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $4.2 billion, an outstanding year. Relative to the third quarter, ethylene margins were unchanged. The decline in pricing of approximately $0.06 per barrel was offset by a lower cost of ethylene production. Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter averaging 97%. The additional La Porte capacity was fully online during the quarter that operated nearly at full capacity. 73% of our production was from ethylene and 88% came from NGLs. The differential between ethylene and propylene prices allowed us to profitably operate our flex unit throughout the quarter. This added approximately $19 million to our results. In Polyolefins, our polyethylene\u2019s price expanded by approximately $0.04 per pound, while the polypropylene\u2019s price was up approximately $0.01 per pound. Polyethylene volumes decreased by approximately 6%. Polypropylene experienced a sales volume decline of approximately 14% due to holiday slowdowns and some late December customer destocking. For the full year, results surpassed 2013 by $617 million primarily due to higher Olefins and polyethylene results. Olefin results benefited from higher prices due to tight industry supply for much of the year as well as a lower cost of ethylene. Polyolefin\u2019s results showed the greatest improvement increasing $530 million versus the prior year as PDE volumes and Spread over ethylene improved significantly. Overall, 2014 was an excellent year. Industry fundamentals were strong. Our crackers continued to operate reliably near nameplate capacity and we normalized for the La Porte turnaround. We also completed the La Porte ethylene expansion and began realizing financial benefits of that production. In January, ethylene price margins have come off their record highs as prices in the market have followed crude oil lower. We continue to see natural gas prices below $3 per million BTU and NGL prices have been weak as inventories have reached record high levels. Let\u2019s turn to Slide number 14 and review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and international segments. During the fourth quarter underlying EBITDA was $392 million or $49 million higher than the third quarter. For the full year, underlying EBITDA was $1.4 billion, a $571 million increase versus 2013. Olefin\u2019s results increased versus the third quarter by approximately $70 million, as a result of the lower cost of net debt, more than offset declining ethylene prices, polyolefin results decreased on lower volumes as sales decreased approximately 3% to 4%. Our Polypropylene Compounding and Polybutene-1business results modestly declined due to lower sales volumes. Seasonal declines of this magnitude are typical in Polyolefins, Polybutene-1 one and Polypropylene Compounds. Equity income from JVs was relatively unchanged. For the full year, segment results increased by $571 million. Olefin\u2019s results increased by approximately $260 million. This increase is largely the result of lower cost of ethylene as a result of lower naphtha costs, increased advantage feedstock processing and higher production. We operated our crackers at 95%, approximately 12 percentage points higher than industry rates. The benefit associated on advantaged feeds totaled approximately $220 million. Our Polyolefin results increased approximately $235 million year-on-year reflecting improved sales than higher volume in polyethylene. Polypropylene Compounding and Polybutene-1 results were relatively unchanged versus 2013. Equity income from our joint ventures increased by $55 million. 2014 also benefited from the $52 million environmental settlement that was recognized during the first quarter, while 2013 benefited from a $25 million insurance settlement. 2014 was a record year for the O&P EAI segment. We are realizing significantly better results following the challenging two years of restructuring and difficult market conditions. Having worked with this team over the last four years, I am very proud of their accomplishments. Their value-oriented approach to markets, focus on feedstock flexibility and restructuring activities ahs enabled this performance improvements surpassing $1.4 billion of EBITDA is an achievement worth calling out. During January, prices continue to adjust to a changing raw material environment. January orders are in line with normal all the quarter activity and our margins and operating rates have been resilient. JVs related earnings are anticipated to moderate consistent with the lower global polyolefin prices. Now please turn to Slide number 15 for a discussion of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $364 million, a decline from the third quarter of $19 million. For the full year, the segment generated EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion and $60 million more than 2013. The quarterly decline was attributable to lower propylene oxide and derivatives following a strong third quarter. In our Intermediate Chemicals business, EBITDA increased approximately $10 million, as strength in our results from declining benzene more than offset the decline in key four chemicals resulting from seasonal impacts and scheduled maintenance. As the Oxyfuels results were relatively unchanged and Oxyfuels results were lower by approximately $10 million. The impact of lower gasoline prices and its typical seasonal declines were partially offset by tight Oxyfuels markets. Declining raw material costs and strong obtained premiums during October and November. The full year 2014 increase versus 2013 reflects strength and stability in our propylene oxide business and increased contribution from our expanded methanol business. You\u2019ll recall that the methanol and the ChannelView was restarted during December 2013. While this asset has not won LyondellBasell\u2019s standards, it did contribute to our earnings and remains a sound investment for the segment. The ChannelView methanol plants ran at 68% utilization rate during 2014 and was a primary driver of a $175 million EBITDA improvement in the acetyls business. Oxyfuels\u2019 results decreased by approximately $30 million versus 2013. Volume and product mix were the primary drivers. Our gasoline and octane premiums have supported the business for most of the year. The New Year has started with a little change in propylene oxide market as the supply and demand fundamentals have remained strong. Oxyfuel prices have moderated, as crude oil and gasoline prices continue to decline. However, Spreads are in line with norms. Methanol prices have also come under some pressure. During the first quarter, we will be conducting scheduled maintenance on ChannelView methanol plant. Based on January margins, we estimate that this will impact segment results by approximately $20 million versus production at full rates. Let\u2019s move to slide number 16 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $33 million, a decline of $77 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $409 million of EBITDA, an increase of $227 million versus 2013. During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 Spread averaged $17.72 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 266,000 barrels per day at our refineries. Spreads at the refinery declined less than the nearly $7 decline in the Maya 2-1-1. The lower Maya Spread was primarily driven by gasoline. The refinery benefited as the negative spread between secondary product values and crude oil price declines. The cost of RINs during the quarter were relatively unchanged from the third quarter. 2014 saw improvement in the Refining segment. Crude throughput averaged 259,000 barrels per day, up 27,000 barrels from 2013. 2013 included a turnaround on a crude unit and a co-product. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark increased by approximately $1.50 per barrel to average $24 per barrel. Cost of RINs decreased by approximately $20 million during the year. Thus far in 2015, the Maya 2-1-1 Spreads averaged approximately $19 per barrel. There is no major maintenance planned at our refinery during the first quarter. We received our initial shipments of Canadian crude through the Enbridge Flanagan South Pipeline system late during the fourth quarter. These volumes should increase across the first quarter. Turning to Slide number 17, let\u2019s step back from the details and think about the business environment more broadly. Over the fourth quarter \u2013 overall, the fourth quarter and 2014 were record periods while margins have eased our positions remain advantaged. Importantly, we continue to generate strong earnings and cash flow. We started the New Year beginning the new chapter in the life of LyondellBasell. While this is a new chapter and many teams will sound familiar, first, we\u2019ll always be committed the safe and reliable operations. Safety is our first priority and it\u2019s a part of our core values as evidenced by our top safety performance. We will also continue to pursue operational excellence focusing on running our world-class assets reliably and efficiently. During 2015, we should benefit from the increased production at La Porte, we anticipate the completion of the expansion of ChannelView and new volumes beginning in the second quarter. We also expect improved operating rates from the ChannelView methanol unit in 2015 following the first quarter maintenance. Cost management will continue to be part of our everyday operations. I believe that our fixed cost should not vary depending on the business cycle. Our structure and resources are designed to function well under a range of industry conditions. Our costs did not escalate during this times when we don\u2019t expect to end very much in difficult times. We\u2019ve built the company to deliver differential results for our shareholders at all business climates. My goal is to leverage this strong foundation and to build upon it. While we anticipate that US ethylene margins will ease to a record 2014 levels consistent with lower oil and gas prices they remain relatively strong. In fact, IHF estimates current ethylene margins to remain above $0.25 per pound. Our business continues to generate significant recessionary cash over and above of our capital program and dividends. The returns on our growth program continue to be excellent and our projects are generating earnings today. We\u2019ve greatly reduced our share count and continue to repurchase shares. Furthermore, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet allowing us to pursue both our expansion plans and other opportunities if and when the timing is right. I look forward to leading this team into 2015 and beyond as we continue to build momentum across the company. Before we open the line for questions, I wanted to make you aware of our upcoming Investor Day. Our executive team will be conducting this session in April 29 in New York. We tentatively planning for the meeting to occur between 8 AM and 1 PM. We will be finalizing the details and we will notify you of the location in the coming weeks. Please plan to join us for the event. We are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you and, Bob, congratulations on your new position. Bob Patel : Thank you, PJ. Good morning. P.J. Juvekar: Good morning. And, as you make your mark on the company, I would like to know how do you think about \u2013 has build efficiency and what it mean by that is, you can build the new plants or expand an existing plant or in buy in, you can buy in your existing businesses or in some \u2013 so just, sort of take a step back and tell us how do you think about all the decisions? Bob Patel : Well, PJ, when I think about buy versus build, we really have to step back and look at free cash flow deployment. So how do we think about our free cash flow deployment and our balance sheet. First of all, our priorities are to maintain our existing assets in top condition. So our maintenance capital is a high priority to us, then our current dividend is also a priority. Beyond that, our focus as has been in the past it should have a stable and growing regular dividend, to have a good focus on growth plans \u2013 on CapEx to the extent that we still have opportunities and then share repurchases. We still see our shares has being a compelling value. We still see the ethylene advantage as being live and well. And we see a bright future for our company. In terms of M&A, we have to compete M&A \u2013 competes with all of these other priorities and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate all of our options as we carry forward the strategy of our company. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And then secondly, there were lot of talk about at the exports and capital being deployed there. With the recent change in the NLG complex, how do you see exports of NGLs or exports of raw materials out of the US? Thank you. Bob Patel : Well, exports of ethane is probably a little bit different than exports of propane and butane. At today\u2019s crude oil price, ethane exports will look less attractive, but over the long run as we have mentioned, in prior calls that there are crackers in Europe and perhaps some in Asia who are uniquely placed to import ethane and benefit from those imports. We don\u2019t expect this to be a very broad sort of program. It\u2019s specific for a few crackers. In the case of propane, propane exports have been increasing. But here in the US, we still see a significant amount of propane supply and ethane supply. Ethane rejection levels today are 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day. So while ethane exports and NGL exports in general will be persistent in the market. We don\u2019t expect those to change the outlook of the US ethylene advantage. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your line is open. John McNulty : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and again congratulations on the new role. When I look at Lyondell, we see you are at levels where you are industry leader in terms of profitability, you are industry leader in terms of safety levels and yet in some of the opening comments and in the release, you had indicated you want to the take the company to the next level. So I guess, I am wondering, how do you think about what the next level is, whether it\u2019s more cash to shareholders or M&A or new platforms being added on. I guess, how should we be thinking about what the next level is in your mind? Bob Patel : Well, thanks John. First of all, when I think about what gets us to the next level, our focus has to be in the near term on running what we have today as well as we possibly can. That enables a generation of free cash flow which affords us to have the opportunity I think about the other items you mentioned that\u2019s just been the job here less than 30 days. We are going to build out our strategy, we are going to work with the Board to discuss an array of options, organic growth, no other growth options that maybe available to us, we\u2019ll develop that over time. But we do see these share repurchases as being a continued focus. We\u2019re likely to ask our shareholders to approve another share repurchase program after this one from this course in May, June. So share repurchases will continue to be something that you will see from us. In addition to that, we will build out our strategy and think about other ways to take the company to the new level. John McNulty : Great, thanks for the color. And then I guess, the second question, you indicated \u2013 as far as your fixed cost you don\u2019t really see that changing all that much and I guess, when we look and we see crude prices getting cut in half and commodity prices rolling over, I guess, are there things that you or Lyondell can do to help to weather this? Are there actions that we should be thinking about that you\u2019ll be taking going forward, or is it pretty much you are going to live and die to some degree what the commodity prices actually do? Bob Patel : Well, first of all, I would remind you that we\u2019ve gone through a fairly significant cost reduction program following 2009 and 2010. And I can tell you that the culture of our company as we don\u2019t wait for prices to change our costs. We manage our cost tightly in good times and in bad times and while we don\u2019t have a program that we are running through the company at the moment, we have opportunities to incrementally improve our cost structure whether it\u2019s in \u2013 more in specific sites, or in specific businesses, those are things that we pursue everyday and we\u2019ll continue to do that for the rest. Our job is to be nimble from a commercial standpoint as these markets are dynamic and continue to run our assets as reliably and safely as possible. We think that that is - that\u2019s our formula and it has been effected \u2013 it will be effected in the future. John McNulty : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMC. Go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. I was wondering, Bob, over the next five years, what do you think is the probability that Lyondell might make a significant acquisition. Do you think it go downstream or complement its upstream operations? Bob Patel : Well, Jeff, it\u2019s a good question and I want to make sure I don\u2019t get ahead of my board and ahead of the team that works together with me here at LyondellBasell. And but certainly, we are going to build out our strategy, we are going to continue the evolution of our company. We think about where we\u2019ve come from, we\u2019ve gone from a company that was really focused on day-to-day survival in 2009 and 2010 to a company that got its cost structure right put in place incredibly strong operating discipline which enabled the free cash flow that we enjoy today. We\u2019ve reached the benefits of internal organic growth opportunities. We still have many ahead of us which we simply can\u2019t lose our focus on those. There is some fairly big projects that are underway and then, of course, as we mine those, we\u2019ll then think about the next steps in terms of strategies. So you will hear more from us as time goes on and we\u2019ll share a bit more with you when we come up to New York for Investor Day. But, think about going through an evolution is most companies has built through and we\u2019ve come a long way and I think we have a long way to go. Jeff Zekauskas : Thank you. And my follow-up, the price of oil has been bouncing around between $45 and $55 a barrel on a Brent basis and if you go back in time, maybe back to the 2008, 2009 recession, the North American ethylene price was in the high 20s, rather than in the high 30s. And of course, ethylene can always fluctuate crude oil the direction it goes with it. Do you have any thoughts on why ethylene is as high as it is given the current Brent price? Bob Patel : Well, generally in our markets, Jeff, the cost part of the equation tends to fall faster than the price part of the equation. Having said that, we have lot to do with how fast and how dynamic prices move. Today, operating rates are relatively high all over the world and when we think about inventories in the value chain they are relatively low. Crude price has been dropping for the better part of 60 days. Based on our past experience in 2008 and 2009, all the participants in the value chain had a propensity to reduce inventory quickly because it did values everyday. We think that\u2019s kind of run its course. As we see here today in January, and as crude oil prices perhaps stabilize and there is an indication of a bottom likely, we are going to see some inventory replenishment and we are going to see a seasonal uptick in demand as we move into March, April, May timeframe. But I think all those factors point to a net positive picture from a demand standpoint. Operating rates are reasonably good. So, and on that slide, perhaps you haven\u2019t seen the kind of impact on ethylene price. And the other thing I would say is that the price of ethane is more tied to gas than it is to oil. So here, as I mentioned earlier, the ethane supply demand indicates that there is an abundance of ethane and rejection levels have reached as high as 400,000 barrels a day. So there is plenty of ethane, there is lots of propane here to compete with ethane to get into the cracker and frankly, we don\u2019t see that changing in the near term. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Bob Koort : Thanks and welcome back to Houston, Bob. I guess, here a month into the job, you got one of the top three performing chemical stocks. So you are certainly a pretty good President. Couple questions for you. One on \u2013 I think you guys have said in aggregate you are going to add maybe 2 billion pounds your US ethylene capacity and maybe 1 billion pounds of polyethylene. I am just curious what your approach is to being a merchant seller or how you view being long or short olefins versus polyolefins as we look to all the capacity additions that are coming into the industry over the next three or four years? Bob Patel : Well, we are a significant merchant player today and we\u2019ll likely be a merchant player in the future in the ethylene market. Our expansions in terms of ethylene, so we\u2019ve got the La Porte one up and running at 800 million. We have the next ChannelView expansion in Q2 of 2015. We have Corpus Christi in Q2 of 2016 and the ChannelView, another ChannelView expansion in 2017. In total, we\u2019ll add about 2.3 billion pound to 2.4 billion pounds. Part of that is to fully support the assets we have on the ground today. You have to remember we also have a flux unit which produces propylene which consumes a significant amount of ethylene. So our options in terms of future integration of ethylene, we could build more polyethylene, we could build another flux unit. We continue to evaluate those options. But I do expect us to be a reasonable size merchant seller of ethylene as well. We feel with those three options, I think we have a reasonable amount of potential to supply new ethylene that will come online. Bob Koort : If I might ask another sort of longer term question, I was at a presentation yesterday by one of your soon to be new polyethylene competitors and they talked about maybe placing two-thirds of their polyethylene output into the export markets which will be a dramatic increase from the rates that the US exports today. What\u2019s your sense on volatility of the industry as all these new units come on over the next few years and the need to export and rely more on the export markets for off-take, is that something that creates a greater risk or what\u2019s your sense of that might develop? Bob Patel : I am not sure about it, that presents risk. Maybe you step back and look at the supply demand outlook for ethylene globally. The US is really the only region that\u2019s having significant amount of ethylene capacity. You don\u2019t see a lot of this in Asia. Asia is more focused on coal-based propylene or PDH-based propylene and there are some crackers but not significant. In Europe, there really is, there are many expansions. So we think about global demand growth of ethylene and you think about the amount of ethylene expansion here in the US, the two match up relatively \u2013 and so we have the Middle East adding ethane-based ethylene production. We do have some mix feed crackers there that are planned with \u2013 being one of them. But, I really see America as being the next exporter of ethylene to support global demand growth and therefore I think prices will equilibrate to kind of international arbitrage and the product will be placed. So, it\u2019s only natural that more product will be exported to meet the demands for the rest of the world. Bob Koort : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great year and those in the management of Bob as well to you. I guess, my first question was on polyethylene and polypropylene. You guys went through some late December destocking in polyolefins. Is it your sense that some of that has run its course? I think you mentioned that as well and what\u2019s your outlook, I guess, for the next six months or so and how that continues? Bob Patel : Well, thanks, Arun for your kind words. In terms of the inventory downstream, I think that across the world, whether you talk about Asia or Europe or US, the inventory in the value chain is on the low end of normal range. And I think buyers are looking to see \u2013 looking for signs of a bottom in prices and in crude oil and as I mentioned earlier, if you think about some level of restocking coupled with a seasonal uptick in demand, going into the next few months, I am relatively bullish about the demand outlook globally on polyolefins. And I think that will carry its way through at least June. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, thanks. And I guess, my next question is on cash flow in the balance sheet. First, do you expect a working capital benefit in 2015? And then, on your buybacks, you mentioned that in the past conversations that you would consider repurchasing up to 10% of your shares, is that still something you are considering and cash flow is lower, would you reduce use you commercial paper or other sources to make that happen? Thanks. Karyn Ovelmen : With regards to the working capital, we do expect to see kind of the continued trend in terms of pricing and in course you\u2019ll see our receivables coming down faster than our payables and so, it will be one of our consistent trend there as we head into the first quarter. With regards to the next 10%, we\u2019ve completed the existing 10% tranch that we are working through right now by May and start to indicate our expectation is that we would look for authorization approval from the shareholders at the next Shareholders Meeting for another 10%. And in terms of funding that, we have consistently been using the balance sheet, we\u2019ve been raising debt as well using discretionary cash flow beyond our working capital, our growth CapEx and our dividend needs to fund that program. We have always said we want to season into this investment grade space into the strong triple D. We\u2019ve been doing that and we are aware that there are opportunities there, it\u2019s indeed we need to fund the next tranch and supplement that with our free cash flow as we go through the next 12 months or so. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Sir, your line is open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Probably, I was wondering if I could ask a bit on the demand side of the equation, the GDP multiplier for ethylene is kind of the kind of spec around one is slightly below one for, kind of the post financial crisis period. In prior times, when we think of lower oil prices and lower plastics prices the multiplier has been higher, what is your view on demand, if we are going to stay lower oil prices and consequently lower plastic prices and I guess, the second part of the question would be do you think it's possible that demand drives us into a ethylene sort of super cycle, if you will? Bob Patel : Well, from a demand standpoint, Vincent, I think, we should think about demand improving based on lower oil price and as emerging markets continue to consumer more polyolefins per person. So, those trends I think are still in place. I am not sure if I am ready to declare some sort of super cycle at this point. But I do think demand will improve incrementally and again, I would point you to, especially in polyethylene or ethylene and derivatives look and see how much new capacity is coming outside of the US and there is not that much. So, we could see, reasonably high operating rates over a longer period of time. But we will have to watch all this and see how demand evolves. Vincent Andrews : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you and Bob, congratulations as well. Hey, Bob, just on your ability to crack propane butane in the Unites States, I was - thought you may have cracked actually more in Q4 than you actually did. Can you talk about why that was the case and potentially going forward for increasing propane and butane crack? Bob Patel : Thanks, Dave. We are known for here in the US is our feedstock flexibility and so, we can crack ethane, propane, butane, we can even crack heavy liquids. But we\u2019ve changed our cracker profile over the past that our cracking profile over the past three four years. We\u2019ve not given up a lot of our flexibility, but what part of that does is, we can\u2019t crack a lot of any one thing. But as you look at where relative propane and ethane prices has been, we\u2019ve been able to capture the value of the NGL barrels being advantaged. And so, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s held us back. It might have some competitors who can crack a lot more propane than we can. But I would tell you that we have industry-leading flexibility which I think will service over the long run. David Begleiter : Very good, and just on the refinery, Bob, can you give us your thoughts or philosophy and how that business fits into Lyondell in the near, medium and longer term? Bob Patel : Well, when I think about more broadly any of our assets, I expect that every asset should realize its full potential. It got to run well and the refinery has certainly made great strides in that area. They have to outperform their peers and our refining is \u2013 probably I think this area as well and more to go we\u2019ve identified many more improvement areas and Kevin and his team are working diligently to realize that potential. We are likely \u2013 all of our businesses at a minimum have to generate positive cash flow and the refinery is doing that. So - and looking forward, we see some potential upside from Canadian crude moving to Houston, we are already realizing some of that to Flanagan South Pipeline and we expect that more of that in full year 2015. So, I still see potential there. The refining business is challenging and we know that, but, we are going to continue to work this asset and make sure it realizes its full potential. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust. Go ahead. Your line is open. James Sheehan : Thank you. Could you give me your outlook for MTBE raw material margins over the next twelve months? Bob Patel : Yes, I think, generally, butane looks to be favored, butane is abundantly available, especially going into the summer months. Recently when I was in Europe, and we were getting butane at prices we haven\u2019t seen in many, many years. Here in the US the same. So, our view is that it\u2019s part of the broader NGL story and we think butane will be abundant and we will contribute to the profitability of our MTBE business going forward. James Sheehan : Thank you and also, as you added towards condo crackers change in the low oil price environment? Bob Patel : Well, we are always open to considering different contracts and options. But as you know, we have a strong list of projects in front of us and as I mentioned earlier in the call, 2.3 billion pounds to 2.4 billion pounds of ethylene expansion. Beyond that, we are always open to considering other projects, but we have enough on our plates and we want to execute well and let\u2019s see what\u2019s ahead of us. James Sheehan : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. I want to jump to Europe if we could, your operating rates relative to the industry were outstanding, but do you see others trying to imitate you and going more to NGLs and basically reducing their cost so that you might have to run more in line with industry averages over the next couple of years? Bob Patel : Good morning, Duffy. Well, in Europe, the landscape is a little different than the US, because each cracker has its own set of circumstances given that there are \u2013 there isn\u2019t a robust logistics ethylene system or feedstocks and for products. So, lot of the crackers in Europe, they are tied to the neighboring refinery and often the ownership is the same. So while they might aspire to crack more propane or more butane, their peak rate maybe more fixed given location and ownership structure and those kind of things. So, incrementally, the industry over there likely will crack a bit more propane. But I don\u2019t see that materially impacting our operating rates or our ability to leverage propane and butane there. Duffy Fischer : Okay, and then another one around Europe, is the Middle East can basically ship products to Europe or Asia and there is kind of a swing factor, do you see lower oil changing the competitive balance between Asia and Europe as a home for Middle Eastern product? Bob Patel : Well, those are the two most natural destinations and over time, generally they tend to come in where the Middle East could be a different. I will tell you that the Asian market is easier to serve than is the European market and it\u2019s some more natural destination for Middle East product. We\u2019ll also have to watch the euro dollar exchange rate as the euro weakens, Asia could look like a more attractive export destination. And likely, European buyers are more sophisticated at times require more higher end products and so on. Typically, not the kind of products we would produce in large facility in the Middle East. So, a lot of factors that point through Asia being the more likely destination of the Middle East exports. Duffy Fischer : Great, thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura. Go ahead. Your line is open. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. I wanted to come back to MTBE. Is there any reason why for MTBE would be weaker in 2015 versus 2014, perhaps there would be less demand for octane or any other reason? Bob Patel : Hi, Aleks. I think, when you think of MTBE, you have to remember really what it is, right it is basically it\u2019s high octane gasoline component. It would be \u2013 no sulfur, it seem very well into the environment. So it\u2019s going to see ups and downs based on octane demand, operating rates and things like that. But generally what you find in here is, you have a market where octane engine demand, there is a number of higher wafer pressure, lower octane materials available in the forms of \u2013 refrains in the US. And MTBE is a natural blending component around the world. So, I think you see a solid market. Or you basically have another gas to oil situation in which butane price, butane inventories are as long as they have which responded to the lower level price oil environment. And our continued volumes are good Aleksey Yefremov : Great, thank you. And as a follow-up, turning to Olefins and Polyolefins, are there any meaningful annual contracts that repriced this year through the annual contracts that could benefit you in 2013? For example, we saw that polypropylene contracts were reported as being more advantageous to producers this year? Is there anything like that going on in polyethylene or ethylene? Bob Patel : No, there is really nothing significant there we\u2019d call out here. Aleksey Yefremov : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. Go ahead. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Can you speak to the extent to which you r long-term view of US NGL supply may have changed given the collapse in crude and the impact on drilling activity. I guess, I\u2019m kind of interested in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe given the probability that the early wave crackers start-up and our understanding is somebody ethane exports have take or pay contracts. Just wondering if you can see a rebalance sooner than you previously did and if so, whether or not that will impact your capital allocation beyond late 2017 in your Channelview project there? Bob Patel : Good morning, Kevin. We haven\u2019t changed our view on ethane supply demand longer term. In the near-term the market will go through a bit of transition. As you\u2019ve probably read, as all have read there, it\u2019s been a pretty significant response on the supply side and oil. Most of the majors have announced 30% to 50% caught on their CapEx budgets, while our E&P companies have announced cut as well. Likely, this will \u2013 to the response in oil price, I can\u2019t tell you when likely that will happen and longer term, we think the US will continue to be a strong producer of natural gas at NGLs and we don\u2019t see the availability of ethane materially changing. And the answer to your question about the capital program, I don\u2019t have any price to adjust to our capital program based on the current market condition in terms of our growth plans on ethylene. We are going to continue on the path we are on, we are going to continue both ChannelView expansions and the Corpus Christi expansion. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then a follow-up if I may on the issue of destocking and restocking I suppose. If I look at the volume numbers that you have on slide 13 and 14, it looks like the sequential volume decrement for whatever reason was a lot larger in the Americas versus Europe, just curious as to why that might be the case and whether or not you're seeing different behavior along the lines of inventory management in the two regions? Bob Patel : We are not seeing anything that\u2019s really different or unusual. The metrics might, seeing sort of a normal end of season decline. As I have mentioned, we saw little bit of a slowdown in buying which we think is some destocking with it. But overall, we are not seeing a big reaction to the pricing and I don\u2019t see anything different across either of the two regions and both are really pretty good line and pretty difficult of what we\u2019ve seen at year end. Kevin McCarthy : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Yes, hi good morning folks, and let me also offer my congratulations, Bob, on the new position. Hey, first a clarification, as I am looking at the slide 9, you talked about polyethylene being down $0.05 in January versus December here in the US. And I guess I was hearing in certain circles that it was only down $0.04. Can you clarify what - where did the industry settle? Bob Patel : The industry settled at $0.04. Frank Mitsch : Alright, great. And then in terms of the new projects, your predecessor laid out that the ChannelView expansion would probably be contributing on an annual basis $90 million of EBITDA and the Corpus Christi expansion, that\u2019s going to be adding about $300 million of EBITDA, once everything was fully up and running and obviously that was at a level the oil wasn\u2019t really higher than it is today. How should we think about those projects in terms of what the ultimate contributions can be? And then, I also noted I think on Corpus Christi, originally that was supposed to come up late 2015 and now it looks like it\u2019s going to be coming up in the second quarter 2016? Was there anything behind the move to delay that expansion? Doug Pike : Hi, Frank, this is Doug. Let\u2019s first talk about the contribution, I mean, it\u2019s still 800 million pound expansion. So we see the margins at over the market turns out to be, think of where we are now is perhaps is showing ethylene margins at over $0.25 a pound. So, we\u2019ll see where things move in this world that we are in where things are moving up and down a little bit right now. But, regardless, on the way it settles very strong, rather it\u2019s going to be a 2013, impossible for us to say at this juncture. Now as far as the timing of Corpus, what we\u2019ve done is, we are going to do our turnaround in the first quarter at Corpus and as you can understand we are making a significant increase in the capacity and we tied a lot of new equipment. So we have to start the expansion with the turnaround. So with new turnaround in the first quarter, that will contribution be bring up the expansion in the second quarter. It\u2019s very much like we do that report. It\u2019s just a matter of framing, Frank. Frank Mitsch : All right, terrific. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Don Carson : Yes, thank you, I want a discussion of where ethylene margins might go, but can you also talked about polyethylene over ethylene spreads is your chart on page 8 shows it widen considerably in the US in the last few years. What drove that and where do you see that heading over the next one to two years? Bob Patel : Well, part of what drove that, Don in the past years is just supply demand. The market has been very strong in the US and we haven\u2019t had expansions here in quite some time. So, market dynamics are very good here. In the near term, I think demand as I mentioned earlier should be incrementally better as we work through the year with the restocking as well as some seasonal uptick in demand. Longer term, our prices in the US tend to be and will be more so in the future tied to export equivalents and so on, especially more for the commodity products. And there again with the wide crude to gas ratio and abundance of ethane here in the US, American producers should enjoy a reasonably good margin. Don Carson : So it doesn't sound like you are in the bear camp that there was spreads and there was lot of controversy over the whether those spreads are sustainable or not to appreciate that color. And then finally, if you can just clarify, obviously with a lot of plants in the US you consume a lot of natural gas just as a fuel for those plants. Just ignoring the feedstocks out of the equation, what's kind of your exposure to the decline in natural gas that we've been seeing in the US? Bob Patel : We certainly b benefited from the natural gas price dropping some \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Doug if we have a number. Doug Pike : Utilities typically for us across all the facilities, a dollar in gas can be about $250 million in utilities that\u2019s including the refinery and the crackers et cetera. Don Carson : Okay, thanks Doug. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Advisors. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Hassan Ahmed : Hi there, Bob. There were obviously a couple of questions earlier about, I guess, the resilience of ethane prices in light of declining crude. I would imagine one of the reasons for that would be significantly lower co-product value contributions, right? And I would imagine again in particular propylene. So just wanted to hear your views about the near to medium term outlook for propylene prices, particularly keeping in mind how you're running, crackers in Europe pretty hard, as well as a fair amount of call it PDH as well as methanol to propylene capacity coming online? Bob Patel : Yes, good morning Hassan. When you think about propylene in the US, they were net short on a capacity basis, our derivatives ability to consume propylene and the amount of propylene that's produced. And our propylene prices already corrected significantly in the past couple of months. And as methane and propane compete be in the lay for crackers, the amount of propylene supply will vary. My sense is that, at these prices, propylene is on the low end. But we'll just have to see how supply demand plays out. But just remember that there is more consumption capacity of propylene at the moment than there is production capacity. Hassan Ahmed : And as a follow-up, one of the things I sort of read in your press release was, in terms of 2015 goals improving your performance on the methanol side of things. Just wanted to get a sense of why they were deflated operating rates to the course of 2014 on the methanol side? Where you see operating roots going for the course of this year, particularly in light of significantly lower methanol prices as well? Bob Patel : Well, you\u2019ll recall that that\u2019s methanol plant was idle for many, many years and we restarted it. So, generally, when you restart units that have been idle for that long, if I am going to discover things as we restarted up and we need to on \u2013 and quite frankly, we got this project done quickly and we came back and found that we need group few things and we\u2019ve done that. So we\u2019ll do that here in Q1. Having said all that, that is still an incredibly profitable project for us providing very strong returns and so we have to work through a few of the things last year. For this year, we expect based on our view on natural gas and our methanol prices that running at full rates will be the right thing to do this year given our outlook on margins. And so we expect to run after the first quarter maintenance activity to run at full rates. Hassan Ahmed : Super. Thank you so much, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. John Roberts of UBS. John Roberts : Can you hear me now? Operator : Yes. John Roberts : Congratulations, Bob. Karyn, do we have to worry about foreign exchange at all in 2015 or most of your US exports in dollars and European margins basically adjust to a US dollar equivalent quickly? Karyn Ovelmen : I think that\u2019s basically right. So our gross transaction exposure. That essentially, the majority of that will have \u2013 50% of that transaction exposure really has financial offset and the remaining exposure is generally netted to our FX derivatives. So the exposure to the combination, there are lot of factors. Substantially it\u2019s due to our naphtha purchases in Europe. Our ID business also played well and our imports in US in US dollars and euro purchases, sell-through euro entities in dollars and MTBE, styrene, butane feedstocks. And it is in our catalyst \u2013 the business which is in US dollar related for dollar euro companies. So though we got a total FX exposure, half of that is internal offsets and remaining that net amount is hedged externally. We do have translation impacts in the balance sheet. And we always see that, but that related to another P&L impact that does with other comprehensive income. And as we are closer to getting the number this year, it\u2019s only 1.38 to 1.21 year-over-year, so there is about 639 reduction on shareholders\u2019 equity, but that is surely with balance sheet only. And then on a translation perspective, it will turn another ratio play out. But year-over-year to 2014, we really didn\u2019t have any significant impact. So, we were at 1.33 for the average to the last year, be 84 and then 1.33 in 2014. So overall, the translation on a P&L\u2019s perspective, there was very minimal impact. John Roberts : Thank you. A \u2013 Doug Pike : I think we have one \u2013 take one more question. We are probably little bit over time. It's being Bob's first opportunity to speak to you, but I think we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Nils Wallin : Great, thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon. I know, Lyondell has been pretty - saying that there is some expectation in all the new builds and the US could get pushed out just because of the normal length of time it takes to build these plants. Now with more oil, there might be less desire to push these plants as quickly as possible, bring them up but on the offset you\u2019d obviously have probably lower labor cost due to all the energy CapEx reductions. What's your view today of when these plants come on-stream? Are they delayed? Are they is it the same? Just - some color there would be appreciated thanks. Bob Patel : Good afternoon, Nils. Well, there are several projects that are already underway in terms of construction. And so, something like seven crackers, and likely those will be built and whatever the pace the projects progress at, it\u2019s likely the second wave of project that were announced which will be revisited. But I think the seven or so that are under construction or will be soon very likely to come up. Nils Wallin : Got it, and then just sort of, I guess a little bit of a technical question on the difference between ethane and propane cost, so historically propane was sort of thought as the ceiling to the ethane price once you net it out all the co-product credits. Now it's below ethane. So curious as to why and the projection is certainly for to be, to continue to be below ethane for the reminder of the year. So, curious as to why you think ethane will correct down to return to its historic relationship and what might be presenting that? Bob Patel : Well, short term you get these kind of dislocations based on inventory or maybe specific logistics-related constraints. But longer term, or later on this year, I would expect that propane we\u2019ll start pursuing, and on the outset you remember that ethane too much below it\u2019s and that\u2019s been trading right around its true value. So, I think the two will completely open, I don't know if propane will really remain more advantaged that ethylene through the entire year, that remains to be seen. The good news is that both are in abundant supply and therefore we should see an advantaged feedstock position here in the US for this year. Nils Wallin : Got it, thanks very much. Bob Patel : All right, well, thank you for all your questions and I\u2019d like to just close with a few comments. First of all, we had a banner here in 2014 and I am not going to repeat all of the operational accomplishments and so on, but, it\u2019s worthy of highlighting that we returned $7.2 billion to shareholders in 2014. We have a regular dividend and share repurchase program, we\u2019ve remained committed to the share repurchase program. We have a very strong and flexible balance sheet which will be durable really in any environment and we\u2019ll support our strategy going forward. While I am new to the CEO role, I am not new to the company and I am certainly not new to the industry. You should expect that in the near tern our focus is going to continue to be our safety and operational excellence and cost management and delivering on all these growth programs we have in front of us. Longer-term, we\u2019ll continue to build out strategy and align with the Board and the kind of things we want to do to the extent that we can discuss some of that with you, we\u2019ll do so at our Investor Day on April 29. So, thank you very much for your continued interest in our company and we\u2019ll look forward to you next time. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now during today's call, we'll focus on first quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I\u2019d like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustment or LCM that we recognized during quarter. This charge is somewhat unique to our 2010 company formation, when all assets and liabilities were measured at fair value, our use of LIFO accounting and the recent declines in prices for many of our raw materials and finished goods inventories. The comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impact of LCM inventory charges. That being said, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanying this call and is available on our website. Let\u2019s take a look at slide four and review a few financial highlights. First quarter earnings per share were $2.54, but EBITDA of $2.04 billion, excluding a $92 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment. This quarter the EPS figure is a new high for LyondellBasell and our EBITDA has now averaged approximately $2 billion in each of the last four quarters. This can be seen in the lower left chart. Strong operational and business performance coupled with share repurchases contributed to a quarterly diluted earnings per share increase of $0.82 per share since the first quarter of last year. Over this one year period, our outstanding share count was reduced by 58 million shares or 11%. At the end of March, we had 475 million shares outstanding and as of the 22nd of April approximately 473 shares are outstanding. Overall, our business portfolio has continued to perform well, margins and volumes have been good leading to consistent strong results. Our revenues have declined since product prices have followed crude oil price declines. Ultimately, in our business, profitability and cash generation are more important metrics and both have been strong. The sustained strength of LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability over the past year in this volatile crude oil environment can be attributed to a combination of items which have helped offset the impact of lower product prices related to the decline in crude oil. First, tightness in the global ethylene and polyethylene supply and demand balances help support product prices. This has been driven in part by planned and unplanned industry downtime, which is persistent into the early weeks of April. Coupled with our solid operations, our O&P segments have benefited from these favorable balances. Additionally, our O&P and I&D segments have benefited from lower U.S. natural gas and NGL prices, which have lowered our production costs. In Refining, increased availability of Canadian crude oil and improving ratio of byproduct pricing to crude oil have benefited the Refining segment. First, we are also benefiting from the ethylene and polyethylene expansions that we completed last year, and our share repurchase program and resulting lower share count having a material effect in raising earnings per share. On slide five, you will note that our safety performance continues to be very good and is showing some improvement when compared with 2014. While we are proud of these results, we certainly not satisfied until we reach perfection in this area. Please turn to slide six and our first quarter and last 12 months EBITDA results. Within the segments, the O&P-Americas first quarter EBITDA was just shy of $1.1 billion. Olefin prices declined with lower global crude oil prices. However, polyolefin in change margins did not fall as much. In O&P-EAI, EBITDA exceeded $350 million. As in the Americas segment olefin prices and margins declined, while polyolefin results improved. In the Intermediates and Derivatives, EBITDA exceeded $375 million, Ethylene oxide and derivatives continued to demonstrate steady performance, methanol results declined due to scheduled first quarter maintenance. During the first quarter, Refining posted EBITDA of $154 million, a highest quarter in more than two years. Crude oil throughput was down but margins increased. Our Technology segment continued to enjoy consistent strong earnings. I will now turn the call over to Karyn for our summary of cash flow. Karyn Ovelmen : Thanks, Bob. Slide seven and eight provide picture of our cash generation and use. During the first quarter, we generated $1.5 billion from our operations and issued $1 billion in 40-year bonds at an interest rate of 4.625%. Our cash and short-term securities balance improved as a result ending the quarter with $3.6 billion or about $600 million more cash and securities than at the end of 2014. Cash used for share repurchases and dividends totaled $1.7 billion during the quarter. During the first quarter we make several annual payments, including Taxes property taxes, customer volume rebates and employee bonuses. Together, these payments totaled approximately $465 million. During the past 12 months, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations, while raising $1 billion from bond issuances and issuing over $4 million in commercial paper. Almost $7.4 billion were used for share repurchases and dividends and another $1.5 billion invested in capital expenditures. Before I wrap up, I want to point a couple of other items that might help your analysis. First, our book tax rate was 27% in line with our previous guidance. Depreciation and amortization was $287 million. However, this includes a non-recurring $35 million impact from amortization of an environmental credit. Thus, the first quarter run rate is below previous guidance. Assuming the euro dollar relationship remains near first quarter levels, we would expect depreciation and amortization to remain near the adjusted first quarter run rate. The final point, I want to discuss is our overall foreign exchange exposure. We have defined some of the pertinent points on slide nine. There are lot of moving parts in our global business but in the end, we believe that the real economic and business exposure to foreign exchange is small relative to the size of our business. Our businesses tend to be global in nature and priced off of crude oil based raw materials. Therefore our products are generally priced in relation to dollars. Of course, we do experience translation impacts in our reported numbers. This quarter the reported translation impact is $45 million as compared with the fourth quarter exchange rate. However, we believe that this was mostly offset within the business and the true economic impact was not significant within our earnings. Along with the nature of the business serving as a foreign exchange buffer, we also hedged our net transaction exposure. When all aspects are considered, we don\u2019t believe that exchange rate had a significant impact on first quarter results. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bob. Bob Patel : Thanks Karyn. Let\u2019s move to a deeper discussion of the underlying segment results, excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charge. Slides 10 and 11 pertain to Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas. First quarter EBITDA was $1.07 billion, about $200 million less than the fourth quarter. Olefins results declined by $280 million as ethylene prices declined by $0.14 per pound from Q4 to Q1. This was partially offset by lower cost of ethylene production, which modestly declined due to lower feedstock and natural gas cost. Our U.S. olefins plant ran at approximately 97% operating rate during the quarter, approximately 10% ahead of the U.S. industry average. Our metathesis unit ran throughout the quarter generating approximately $20 million of EBITDA. Approximately 90% of our ethylene was produced from NGLs with ethane representing approximately 70% of ethylene production. On slide 11, we have plotted the key NGL prices and the costs of ethylene production metrics as estimated by IHS. These provide good perspective on the NGL price response to the decline in the price of crude oil as well as the impact to the cost of ethylene production. You can see that U.S. propane and butane prices largely followed the price of crude oil lower. Similarly ethane prices followed natural gas prices. These movements accompanied by co-product price movements result in IHS' estimated cost of ethylene production metrics, plotted on the right hand side of the slide versus the first quarter of last year, IHS' estimates that the price of ethylene declined by nearly $0.14 per pound while the cost of ethylene production metric declined by nearly $0.10 per pound. Our margin results show a similar trend while volumes are benefiting from our expansions in the absence of last year\u2019s significant turnaround activity. While the olefins results declined sequentially, polyolefin results improved by approximately $75 million as price declines lagged the declines in monomer prices. This led to an increase in margin versus the fourth quarter of 2014. However, both polyethylene and polypropylene margins declined as the quarter progressed and finished the quarter lower than where they started. Thus far during the first weeks of April, sales and production volumes have been relatively consistent with the end of first quarter pace. We don\u2019t have any significant maintenance plan for the quarter. Our 250 million pound per year Channelview ethylene expansion is scheduled to be online late in the second quarter. From a cost standpoint, NGL and natural gas cost remained low. At this time, April product prices are still being negotiated. So I won\u2019t offer further commentary. Let\u2019s turn to slide 12 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. First quarter EBITDA was $357 million or $35 million less than the fourth quarter. Olefin results declined by approximately $105 million, similar to the America segment, the decline is related to lower pricing versus the fourth quarter of 2014, the first quarter average ethylene price declined by $0.14 per pound roughly equivalent to the decline in the Americas segment. Our cost of ethylene production metric was relatively unchanged in dollar terms. We produced almost 50% of our ethylene from raw materials with the cost advantage to naphtha. While still significant, the contribution from these feeds declined by approximately $15 million versus the fourth quarter. Olefin operating rates remain strong at 94% of capacity, more than 10% ahead of the European industry average. Combined polyolefin results partially offset lower olefin results as EBITDA improved by approximately $45 million. Volume increased in polyethylene and polypropylene by 22% and 16% respectively. Polyolefin spreads improved roughly 9% in local currency but they were unchanged on a dollar basis. Polypropylene compounds and polybutene-1 benefited seasonally as volumes improved by approximately 12%, coupled with increased margins, EBITDA increased by approximately $30 million. JV equity income increased slightly to $57 million. April business conditions have been relatively consistent with those experienced during the first quarter. Now, please turn to slide 13 for discussion of our intermediates and derivative segment. Exclusive of the LCM impacts, first quarter EBITDA was $381 million, $17 million higher than the fourth quarter. Propylene oxide and derivatives results improved by approximately $15 million on 11% higher volume. Industry maintenance and sales into the aircraft de-icing end use contributed to the volume increase. Intermediate chemical performance improved by approximately $35 million. However, it is often the case, individual products saw varying results. Acetyl results declined by approximately $20 million due to our scheduled Channelview methanol plant maintenance and lower product margins, each was responsible for approximately half of that decline. The methanol plant returned to operation in March and ran near full rates since that time. The acetyl decline was offset by stronger EO, EG and styrene results as well as the absence of some fourth quarter costs. Oxyfuel results were lower by approximately $35 million, primarily due to lower margins following a typically strong fourth quarter margins. For oxyfuels, our year-on-year comparison removed seasonality and provide a different perspective. On this basis, you can see in the chart on the lower right that raw material margins are relatively unchanged. This variance might surprise you given the decline in crude oil and gasoline pricing. However, butane and methanol raw material cost have also declined. April business conditions have been generally similar to conditions experienced late in the first quarter. We\u2019ll have a PO/SM unit turnaround at Channelview during the quarter. This will impact propylene oxide and styrene production. Although plans have been made to minimize the impact, we estimate that second quarter segment results will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million. Let\u2019s move to slide 14 for the discussion of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $154 million. Excluding LCM impacts, this is $121 million quarter-on-quarter increase. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $23.74 per barrel. The realized spread of the refinery was relatively consistent with the Maya 2-1-1 spread. Crude throughput averaged 241,000 barrels per day, a decline of about 25,000 barrels per day, primarily due to maintenance and the third-party off-gas processor and some maintenance within the refinery. The lower throughput impacted results by approximately $20 million. During the quarter, we increased shipments of -- we received increased shipments of Canadian crude oil, as a result of the volume of combined Canadian and light U.S. crude process doubled versus the fourth quarter, reaching almost 30% of our crude slate. However, during the period, the per barrel advantage was relatively small versus other heavy crude oil. The capture rate on the benchmark spread improved as the price difference between byproduct and crude prices declined. This has waived the capture rate on the spread to the low 70% level from approximately 60% during 2014. RIN costs were relatively unchanged versus the fourth quarter. April benchmark spreads have averaged approximately $23 per barrel. The third-party facility that impacted first quarter operating rates has completed their maintenance. During April, we have operated the refinery unit less than full capacity as we conducted some maintenance ourselves. We plan to increase rates shortly. This will slightly impact second quarter throughput. As you may know, the majority of our employees at the Houston refinery represented by the United Steelworkers union remain out on strike. The company has negotiated diligently and in good faith with the union from the beginning and we remain committed to negotiating in good faith and for a fair and responsible contract. To date, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on local issues and the strike continues. As a result of this strike, we\u2019ve decided to delay our planned fourth quarter FCC turnaround to first quarter 2016. I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank all of our employees and contractors who have been operating the refinery during this period, including employees represented by the union who have elected to return to work. Through their commitment, we\u2019ve operated the refinery safely, reliably and enabled it to achieve the best quarterly results in over two years. Our technology segment continued to perform well, with both the catalyst and licensing businesses slightly ahead of fourth quarter results. In this segment, licensing revenues can be lumpy. We would now turn to slide 15. I'll briefly summarize and then we'll take your questions. The key point, I want to emphasize is the consistency and strength in our results across the past four quarters and while we have experienced a very volatile crude oil and raw material market, our businesses have performed consistently well. In O&P Americas, we\u2019ve been aided by strong operational performance, olefin margin improvement and low-cost natural gas and NGLs. In O&P-EAI, it is a similar story as both naphtha and advantage raw material costs have declined to offset falling product prices. Although, we have a translational effect related to the euro-dollar exchange rate, increases in euro based results offset the impact. As a result, dollar based margins and spreads were relatively unchanged. Our I&D segment continued to show consistent results of the characteristics of its product, contracts and portfolio dampen the impacts of raw material volatility. The Houston refinery bounced back from a weak fourth quarter to post results that exceeded the past nine quarters. Our first quarter results in my comments regarding April business should provide a level of comfort that our business is responding very well in this period of crude oil price volatility. Our focus on operations and optimization enable us to move quickly.  Meanwhile, our project teams continued to move our expansions forward with the next start-ups scheduled for the end of this quarter. It\u2019s difficult to say that every quarter in 2015 will achieve the earnings results of this quarter. However, our focus on safety, operational reliability and costs position us to perform relatively well in any environment. Thus far, April has not disappointed. At this time, I will close the formal comments by reminding you that we will hold our Investor Day next Wednesday in New York and via webcast. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just wanted to understand some of your comments. You've pointed out some outages that are supporting pricing right now and you said that conditions are relatively consistent. Can you comment on the demand trends that you're seeing in April and maybe your expectations for May and June? Do you expect restocking or increased consumer demand, especially in Europe as well just given a weak euro? Thanks. Bob Patel : Market conditions are very strong, as I mentioned in the previous earnings call. Generally, we see seasonal improvement in our demand going in Q2. So if you look back in time, Q2 tends to be one of our stronger quarters in terms of demand. As we sit here today, supply-demand balances are well balanced and any small outages have caused tightness or even shortage in regional market. So my sense is that volumes will remain strong in U.S. and Europe in April, May and June. Small outages or regional outages can cause local disruptions. We are at that point on the operating rate curve where markets are -- supply and demand are well balanced. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up in I&D as well, you stated in the press release that there are some seasonal benefits. Maybe you can just help us parse that out with some of the downtime. Do you expect Q2 results to be up? And then how does the rest of the year play out? Thanks. Bob Patel : Generally, Arun in I&D, the seasonality comes from oxyfuels where we benefit from butane is becoming relatively less expensive in the summer months and the blend season kicks in. So, I expect that oxyfuel results should improve as they do each year seasonally in Q2. For the rest of the year, we expect very good demand for all of our products in the I&D business. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi. You may ask your question. PJ Juvekar : Yes. Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. PJ Juvekar : European and Asian ethylene seems to be quite tight. And I think there are a couple of things going on. I think 10% to 12% of Asian capacity is out for maintenance. And then secondly, oil prices have gone up. So that might cause some restocking. So how do you think about this tightness and how do you think that plays out for rest of the year? Bob Patel : In the case of Asia, supply and demand balances are tight. And then as you rightly note, there were lot of outages in Q1. From what we see in the IHS information, the planned outages are actually going to be higher in Q2 compared to Q1. So, I would expect that in a rising oil environment, the restocking plus seasonal demand increase should be positive for products sales into Asia. And I think that should tighten the global supply demand balance, especially for polyethylene. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. And then secondly, just on a longer-term issue, oil and gas CapEx has come down quite a bit. The rig count has fallen and it seems like the labor pressure on the Gulf Coast is easing a little bit. Would you like to take advantage of that with any further brown field or green field projects, or is that too early to make a call? Thank you. Bob Patel : Thanks, P.J. Well, I think it\u2019s a little early to make that call, because we really haven\u2019t seen the labor rate stabilize yet. Perhaps it\u2019s safe to say that the rate of increase in labor rates has not been as much as what we\u2019ve experienced. We will continue to evaluate that, but as you know, we have a lot of projects still in front of us that we need to execute in terms of the bottlenecks. We remain focused on those as those are low costs, high return and they will be well ahead of the first class routes capacity that will come out. So we will evaluate as we continue to evolve our strategy, but at this point, we remain committed and focused on executing what we have in front of us and then we will see how labor markets evolve. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. David Begleiter : Good morning. Bob, can you discuss your view of U.S. ethane now $0.18 a gallon near all-time lows. How do you see that price trending this year and how you do ethane supply demand going forward over the next three or four years, given perhaps maybe a little lower growing activity and increased demand from new crackers and export facilities? Bob Patel : Well, in terms of supply demand balance, we see still an abundance of ethane. They are somewhere 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day of ethane being rejected today. So that\u2019s a significant amount and could supply several world scale crackers that will be built in the U.S. In terms of the near-term price dynamics, it seems to me that the ethane has been trading right around its field value and with propane being abundant, propane will be competing to be in the cracker feed slate here in the U.S. So between both of those being well supplied, my sense is that ethane will be closer to its fuel value in the foreseeable future. And with natural gas prices at $2.50 coming in the December months, I expect that ethane prices should be where they are today. David Begleiter : Very good. And Bob, just make -- I am sure you will address this Wednesday, but how do you view acquisitions and what role they might play in Lyondell\u2019s future over the next five to seven years? Bob Patel : Our focus David has been on share repurchase as a means of deploying our free cash flow. That\u2019s really the benchmark that we compare acquisitions to. We will continue to develop our strategy with our Board and we will look at different alternatives, but frankly we have to think about why -- what are we trying to sell for. It is an acquisition for the sake of growth or to become bigger not necessary as we are already a very large company with the global footprint. We have incredible scale and we will show you that next week at Investor Day. So we are in a great spot. We don\u2019t have to do something in terms of an acquisition today. We will evaluate different options of our strategy with our Board and in the meantime continue to focus on delivering on our CapEx that we in front of us and continue our share repurchase program as we have outlined. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. You may ask your question. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : You broadly spoke about demand obviously being good and you mentioned restocking generally. My question is a bit more specific about the polypropylene side of things. If I take a look at sequential volume improvements, a good 6% in O&P Americas, up 16% within EAI. Is this sort of sustainable? Is this primarily restocking related? I mean, if you could talk a bit about the polypropylene market in general. Bob Patel : Yes. I think in polypropylene in both regions, demand is growing at a reasonable rate. There is some restocking that probably occurred in Q1 and some destocking on our side. So if you think about an inventory in the value chain, I am not sure that has increased significantly. It\u2019s probably shifted a little more downstream. Having said that, I don\u2019t think inventory downstream is on the high side, it\u2019s probably about right going into a seasonal uptick in Q2. So could we experience 16% growth quarter-after-quarter probably not. There are some timing effects here. But I do see demand being very strong globally. And Q2, as I mentioned earlier, tends to be our stronger quarter in terms of volume. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. Now as a follow-up, as sort of more of your brown field facilities come online and expansions happen. Within the Americas you are becoming net long ethylene to the tunes of I would say over 1 billion pounds. So what is the plan associated with that ethylene? Do you want to continue sort of being a merchant seller of ethylene? Do you want to integrate into may be polyethylene units, I mean what\u2019s the strategy there? Bob Patel : Well, we have many options in front of us. This is one of the topics that we will discuss next week at Investor Day, but briefly the options we have in front of us are merchant sales which there is still plenty of opportunities out there, a new polyethylene plant, or we could build another metathesis plant to make propylene. So we continue to evaluate that and we will discuss a little more in detail next week at Investor Day how we think about those options, but we think we have a solid options ahead of us and the bottleneck projects have very good returns. Hassan Ahmed : Very good. Thanks so much, Bob. Bob Patel : Thank you, Hassan. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Bob, could you talk a little bit about sort of where we -- how we should think about the European operating rates over the next couple of quarters, obviously very high this quarter and obviously lot about it just, but how should we thinking about it into Q2 and then maybe thereafter? Bob Patel : European operating rates have been strong and in my view will be strong going into Q2. Vincent, there is a couple of things that are going on in Europe and I think are benefiting the operations there. One is the weaker euro is improving export competitiveness of our customers as the end users of our products. And we are seeing less imports because of the weaker euro. So more and more of what we are seeing is competitiveness of polyethylene or polypropylene exports as well as finished goods. The other is of course lower oil price makes Europe competitive on the global cost curve. So my sense is that we are going to run at full capacity for the foreseeable future Q2 and Q3. I don\u2019t expect that to change. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up, you addressed sort of how you think about the ethane price forecast going forward as it relates to new capacity. But what do you think might happen on the outlook price, on the polyethylene price as always new crackers come along, and presumably that product has get forced out into the export market and what do you think that could do to spreads for sort of balance for North America? Bob Patel : Well, I think longer-term as some of the larger green field capacity comes online that product will be exported on the increment to either Asia or to South America. And so the margins in the U.S. will largely depend on the crude to gas ratio and cost of production in destination markets like China. And so my sense is that just like the Middle East and years ago built out their capacity to export, will the U.S. will fulfill ethylene derivative demand growth in the coming years. And so I think the margins will still be good and in the sense the U.S. advantage is present today and could get better as the crude to gas ratio increases again. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks very much. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura. You may ask your question. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Your working capital declined slightly quarter-over-quarter? Do you expect to realize more pronounced benefit later in the year in terms of your working capital? Thank you. Karyn Ovelmen : We don\u2019t expect any major swings in working through the end of the year. We exclude LCM in some of the Forex. It really were pretty flat on a normalize basis in terms of working capital. And we expect that kind of -- we\u2019ll see some seasonality towards the end of the year, but no significant changes in working capital through the year. Bob Patel : Yeah. We don\u2019t have any significant inventory dislocations in our system. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. And as a follow-up, another question on ethane, do you think there is enough pipeline capacity that connects the Northeast NGL producing regions to the Gulf Coast? We currently have one pipeline? Do you think there are more pipelines needed and if that is the case, do you think those pipelines can be build in time for ethylene crackers startups in 2018? Bob Patel : Well, I think, there is sufficient supply of ethane here on the Gulf Coast already. And as those crackers get built out, I would imagine that some of the lines that we are going south to north will be reversed and will get more ethane from the north. Sergey Vasnetsov : Yeah. Aleksey, I think, in general Marcellus and Utica as they build up. Off take has been one of the issues. It\u2019s been address first by the ATEX pipeline. There have been two more pipeline proposals. It\u2019s a same in gas coming off of those facility but they have to build out the infrastructure. And really this is all part of what\u2019s been going on in the industry really for the last five years. The E&P progresses than the midstream catches up and we been a logical beneficiary of it as they develop. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. You may ask your question. Don Carson : Thank you. Question on U.S. feed slate in the quarter and going forward. Bob, you mentioned that you -- 90% of your feed slate was NGLs, was 70 percentage points ethane. Is that 20% dealt to the max propane and butane you can crack and if so would you plan on any investments to increase your flexibility to crack propane and butane? Bob Patel : Yeah. Don, not necessarily that that 20% is the max and we have more flexibility within that. It\u2019s just a question of economic and optimization, and how we run our crackers week to week, but we have flexibility. And remember we also crack some liquid feed stocks down in Corpus Christi. So its not just ethane and propane, we kind of crack full range. Sergey Vasnetsov : And we\u2019ll talk to this some more in the Investor Day as well. Bob Patel : Yeah. Don Carson : Okay. And then just a follow-up on near-term pricing, it looks like polyethylene is going to rollover flat in April. There is an industry thought an initiative in May that looks like it has real support? How long you think this tightness in polyethylene is seasonal uptake that we\u2019re seeing? What\u2019s kind of your price outlook for not only in Q2 but also going into the second half of the year? Bob Patel : Well, I\u2019ll speak to markets rather than price and I would say that, the supply demand is very firm today. And so there is market underpinning or what you see -- and so we\u2019ll just have you see how the quarter develops. But I\u2019m very bullish about demand for Q2. I think demand for Q2 will be very good as it is seasonal. Don Carson : Thank you. Operator : And so our next question comes from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. You may ask your question. James Sheehan : Thanks. Question for Karyn. How do you see the pace of share buybacks occurring through the rest of the year? Karyn Ovelmen : Yeah. We are going to -- we\u2019ll continue to on the pace that we are at. We have the second 10% that will be wrapping up here in the May timeframe. And in our next Annual Meeting we have the authorization that we expect to get approval for an additional 10% going forward. James Sheehan : Thanks. And on the Refining segments you mentioned some maintenance occurring here in the second quarter. How do you see that affecting throughput? Sergey Vasnetsov : I think it will be minimal. We just about completed and already started, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be material for the segment. James Sheehan : All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. You may ask your question. John Roberts : Good morning. Nice quarter. One of the messages from the IAHS Conference last month was that we\u2019re heading into a period where propylene would be long relative to ethylene. I don\u2019t know if you agree with that? And if you do agree with that, how does -- is that going to play out through your polypropylene, propylene oxide. You mentioned you're looking at expanding metathesis? I don't think you do that along propylene market, but maybe if you could give us your outlook on propylene? Bob Patel : Sure. Thanks for the question, John. Well, propylene is one of those molecules that when its get long, the sources of production tend to adjust. So, for example, when propylene values fall, generally you crack less propane, you crack more ethane. For us we have the flexibility to run the metathesis unit or not to run the metathesis unit. We\u2019ll certainly evaluate that as we think about investment. I know that IAHS has a view on propane. To propylene, the PDH plants when they come on. But remember as propane balances become narrower and propane price could rise and therefore, propylene from propane could become more expensive. So there are a lot of factors that impact the propylene price and it is very dynamic. So before we make an investment, certainly we would think through all of those factors. John Roberts : So you\u2019re thinking propane rises or are you thinking propane stays low? Bob Patel : I think if there\u2019s a lot of propane consumption, propane could rise. And remember propane can be exported as well in a much larger quantities that ethane can. So we\u2019ll just have to see how those supply-demand balances develop over the longer term. It all just depends on the timeframe. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : And so our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Bob, if we look at the industry data, looks like polyethylene resin exports surged something like 42% in March after five straight months of decline. So if you could talk about your own mix of domestic polyethylene sales versus exports and with outages overseas, would you expect the international trade component to remain strong? Bob Patel : Kevin, our exports have increased a little. But we -- as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past calls, we tend to export a little bit less than the industry average. And generally, we have longer-term sales contracts going to South America rather than Asia. So our focus is less on Asia when it comes to exports. I do think that the industry has exported a bit more, I\u2019ve seen that in some of the data that\u2019s been published but for us it\u2019s not significant in terms of the increase. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then as a second question, it looks as though you're propylene monomer production increased 12% in 1Q versus 4Q. Is that all explained by your metathesis unit and then did you run that unit full out in the quarter or did you crack more propane as well? Bob Patel : It\u2019s the combination of the two, Kevin. We did run the metathesis unit most of the quarter. That contributed to most of the propylene production increase. And then some of that was a bit more [Technical Difficulty] propane. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Thank you very much. Bob Patel : Mostly, metathesis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question. Frank Mitsch : Yes, good morning folks. And obviously a great start to the year. Bob, I\u2019m just curious, obviously, a big deal relative to the three. From your perspective where there any big surprises, relative to what your expectations were three weeks ago, I'm sorry three months ago or not necessarily? Bob Patel : Good morning, Frank. For us I think what\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen develop over the quarter is that the market is a lot stronger that we expected and supply demand are much more balanced, some of these outages that we didn't predict. Our sense is that we are really realizing markets where operating rates are in that 90%, 92% range and when there are outages, it causes some margin expansion. And of course, I think prices come off a bit during the period. Our share repurchases have benefited us as well. There are a lot of factors. And we ran well as we are known to do. So not necessarily surprises, but I would say just more confirmation that we have a fairly strong market environment. Frank Mitsch : All right. Terrific. I do concur that given everybody running as hard as they are, you are bound to have more unplanned outages than what the consultants are setting out there. So knock on wood, it\u2019s not even obviously your safety. Your safety slideshows that you know how to run assets? And then if I could ask a question on the I&D segment, you were talking about the PO/SM turnaround being about a $20 million impacting Q2. If I am not mistaken, I think you were thinking that the methanol turnaround in Q1 was also going to be a $20 million impact. But I think your comments today suggested that was closer to $10 million, is that correct and if so why was it less of an impact? Bob Patel : Yes. Actually, it\u2019s just because of the way the margins evolve in the methanol business during the quarter versus our prior estimate. And then on the PO/SM unit it\u2019s based on what we know today in terms of margins. But we\u2019ve largely prepared and mitigated most of the impact of that PO/SM outage. And by the way methanol plant is running very well and at nameplate capacity. So the team at Channelview did a really nice job in conducting the maintenance, getting it back up and delivering on what they had intended. Frank Mitsch : Terrific and thank you so much. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA. You may ask your question. Nils Wallin : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. In terms of your own operations obviously olefins in Americans has been running at very high rates for multiple quarters. Is there a risk that do you need to either pull back on those units at some point to prevent an unplanned outage or how do you look at the higher rates over sustainable period? Bob Patel : Yeah. Good morning Nils. No, we are not running these units at above benchmark. We are not pushing them beyond their capability. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in past calls, we\u2019ve been very diligent in doing our turnarounds at the prescribed cycles and so on. So I would say that our discipline around maintenance and around how we manage our operations allows us to run at our nameplate capacity. But we're not pushing beyond that necessarily. We don\u2019t want to go beyond the capability of the plant for near-term gain, that\u2019s not our philosophy so. And we\u2019ll continue to run within the capability of each of our units. Nils Wallin : Understood. And then with respect to polyethylene inventories, do have a sense of what level they might be down at the customer converter level? There has been some discussion that distributors are starting to get their warehouses pretty full? Bob Patel : No, I haven\u2019t heard any significant trend there. It could be that one or two have a bit more. But going into Q2, a bit more inventory shouldn't concern anybody because generally demand is very good. So my sense is inventory is kind of at par in the value chain. I don't think it\u2019s very high or very low frankly. Nils Wallin : Thanks very much. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. Good morning. Bob Patel : Good morning. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. Lyondell was always contemplating NLPs. Has it made a decision yet or positive or negative? Bob Patel : Jeff, that's one of the topics we were going to cover at Investor Day next week. So, we\u2019ll provide our analysis and how we think about it and we'll discuss next week at Investor Day. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. That sounds great. And then secondly, your tax rate keeps coming down even though you make more in the United States. Can you explain why that's the case and if there\u2019s a difference between your book taxes and your cash taxes? Karyn Ovelmen : Yeah. As far as the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, it\u2019s pretty much still in line that we are on 27% for an effective tax rate. And then on a cash tax basis, we are lower than that and we are in the 23% range. It\u2019s fairly consistent with prior years. We continued our optimized -- our tax cash structure but we did see a slight, slight uptick here this quarter with larger earnings in the U.S. And you will see that as the mix of earnings for more North America based, you\u2019ll see our rates 10 and 12 depending on what jurisdictions our earnings are at. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. You may ask your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, guys. Bob Patel : Good morning. Duffy Fischer : Questions on say just the last 12 months if we step way back 50,000 foot view, lot of volatility in oil and some of your inputs, not very much volatility in your earnings, Bob, I wonder if you could just kind of -- if you step back a year ago and we told you what would happen with energy, what surprised you and what actually played out over the last year versus what you would have thought a year ago? Bob Patel : So, I think markets, they were a lot stronger than we thought they would be a year ago. Demand growth has been very good globally. There have been these unplanned outages recently that we discussed. Natural gas price has drifted down. So if you look at the graph that we had in our earnings report here. While crude oil price dropped and butane and propane dropped as well, ethane dropped. So we\u2019ve seen our cost come off a bit. Our share repurchase program has also helped in terms of EPS, which is the intended purpose of the share repurchase program. And we continued to push reliability and push our units hard. So, I would say if there's one thing that I could point too to that\u2019s perhaps a bit different is that supply-demand is just much stronger. And so price declines on products have not been at the same pace as the oil price might indicate. Duffy Fischer : Okay. Thank you. And then your catalyst business gives you a pretty good insight into what people are thinking about building on the olefins, polyolefins chain. When you look into that business, how do you see the next three to five years as far as your Olefins, polyolefins business grows global build out? Bob Patel : Yeah. So in the case of polyethylene, if you just look at IHS data, it\u2019s even beyond our catalyst business. And supply growth is going to be somewhere in the 3% to 4% range annually. Demand grows at above that same pace. So our sense is based on what's been announced and the likelihood of some of the projects being pushed a year or two based on recent announcements. Our sense is that new supply will meet incremental new demand and that we could have a period of relatively high operating rates. And we\u2019ll show that next week when we have our Investor Day, our own view and IHS\u2019 view on operating rates. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Bob Koort : Thank you very much. Bob, you mentioned the volumes of your plastics in Europe were really quite exceptional. I think there maybe five or six force majeures during the first quarter or so. Where did all that product go? Were you displacing your competitors that couldn't run their plants at rates, or was there some restock inventories build and I'm speaking to Europe specifically and then how do you see that normalizing through the rest of the year? Bob Patel : Yeah. So in Europe, I think there were three factors. One was restocking. The other was just higher demand from our customers because of their export competitiveness, especially in film. Out of this film is where we see that the most. And then, yes, we did displace some of our customer sales when they had issues. And we also had a little bit of an issue at M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster, which we resolved. So it\u2019s a combination of factors. My sense is that the European market is going to be pretty strong here in the foreseeable quarter or two. And then we'll have the typical seasonality in Q4, barring any sort of economic issue. Bob Koort : And if I may follow up in the Americas looks like Total and Shintech have put their name to the list that\u2019s growing for U.S. new plant builds. I\u2019m just curious do you think Lyondell will ever build a brand new plant or will continue to be the incremental adds? And then secondly, you mentioned ethane at fuel value, but the need maybe to start sucking in some barrels from North and Northwest or Northeast, would you expect that at least you see the ethane price have to accommodate that transportation tariff down to the Gulf Coast or do you think you can still sell below fuel value plus traditional spreads out into the future? Bob Patel : In the case of our expansion, Bob, we still have quite a bit in front of us in terms of the debottlenecks. We really evaluate as we do many other alternatives, green field type project, that completes with share repurchase program and other projects. So we\u2019ll evaluate that. I know I wouldn\u2019t say that we would never do it. It is one of the options, and so we will just continue to think through that. In terms of ethane and maybe incremental increase because of ethane coming north to south, it\u2019s possible. But even if that increase were do occur, when you think about it on a global basis, ethane will still be advantaged compared to polyethane production in China based on naphtha. So my sense is that the ethane advantage and the U.S position on the global cost curve will largely be what we think it is today. There will be plenty of ethane and supply of this new expansion that are planned. And in the case of Shintech and Total, the timing of those were already essentially in the middle of the 2015. So I expect there are going to be towards the end of this wave of capacity that\u2019s been announced. Bob Koort : Okay. Thanks very much. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Can you aggregate your cost advantage feedstock tailwind that you had in the quarter, in Europe and the U.S. and how you think about it for the balance of the year? And given the strength in the supply-demand balances that you're seeing, do you expect sort of bump in the number of brown field announcements before the wave of green field announcements gets done? Or do you think that that sort of capacity is tied off at this point? Doug Pike : Laurence, this is Doug. Let me try to take that first and then maybe Bob will add some. I think when you think of the advantage feeds, let\u2019s go to Europe and look there. As we said about half of our ethylene was produced from advantage feeds. As percentage wise that where we\u2019ve been running. What perhaps is different about that is this year because of the pricing of NGLs, we\u2019ve been able to do it throughout the winter quarters. Now, the advantage we said it was down about $15 million from quarter-to-quarter, so it\u2019s a little bit of that trending there. And of course, like we told you last year in our facilities, the benefit from advantage features a little lower $200 million across the year. So I\u2019m going to give you kind of the picture of it, but I think key was the dynamic of the NGL markets even in the lower crude price allowed us to continue process enough at those rates. In the U.S, we are pretty much -- I think the graphs that we showed you pretty well showed you how you follow through. Our mix moved a little bit as it always does. Our guys optimize almost daily and weekly. So you move your mix a little bit around. Propane was attractive for a while, but that\u2019s a penny or two versus ethane. So we\u2019ve been able to hold those types of opportunities and advantages as we move forward. Bob Patel : And Laurence to answer to your question about brown field, potential brown field expansions, I think a lot of the debottlenecks sort of opportunities have been harvested because of the advantage that existed over the last two, three years. So, well, we might find some more, other companies might find some more. I would imagine that most of what was possible has already been harvested. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I\u2019m showing no further question. Bob Patel : Okay. Well, then I\u2019ll offer just a couple of comments as we close out the call. Look we had a terrific quarter with strong performance across the entire company. Our focus on safety, operational reliability, commercial agility, and cost discipline, they continued to prove resilient in a volatile crude oil environment. I'm extremely proud of what our team across the world has accomplished and their continued focus on everyday excellence. I think that's really what defines us. We look forward to seeing all of you next week at Investor Day and thanks for your continued interest in our company. Operator : Thanks. And this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

Roberts - UBS Securities LLC Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC Operator : Hello and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin. Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Mizelle. Well hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's second quarter 2015 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO, and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning & Transactions. But before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Now for more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com. Now finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time today until 11 PM Eastern Time on August 28 by calling 888-568-0061 in the United States and 203-369-3454 outside of the United States. And the passcode for both numbers is 62324. Now during today's call we'll focus on second quarter results, the current business environment, and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I' would again like to call your attention to the non-cash, lower cost or market inventory adjustment, or LCM, that we've been discussing on past calls. As previously explained this charge is somewhat unique to our 2010 company formation, when all assets and liabilities were measured at fair value, our use of LIFO accounting, and the recent volatility in prices for many of our raw materials and finished goods inventories. Our LCM adjustments have been updated for the second quarter, which for some segments resulted in reversals of some or all of the first quarter charges. And for the second quarter a $9 million favorable lower cost of market inventory adjustment was recorded. Our comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of LCM inventory charges. And with that being said I now turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our earnings call. Let's take a look at slide 4, and review a few financial highlights. Second quarter earnings per share was $2.79 with EBITDA of $2.2 billion. This quarterly diluted EPS figure is another new all-time high for LyondellBasell. And as represented by the orange lines in the lower left chart, our EBITDA has now averaged approximately $2 billion in each of the last five quarters. During the second quarter we completed our second 10% share repurchase authorization and received approval from our shareholders for a third 10% authorization. We also increased our dividend by 11% during the quarter. Our commitment to return cash to shareholders remains consistent. Turning to slide number 5 you will see that we continue to have an excellent and improving safety record. While these results demonstrate incremental improvement, we're always looking to attain our goal of zero incidents. To this end during June all employees of LyondellBasell participated in our Fifth Annual Global Safety Day. This is a day where we refocus the entire company, our contractors, and suppliers on our commitment to operate with zero injuries and pursue the safety perfection. We continue to believe that focus on safety and reliable operations go hand-in-hand. Before leaving the topic of safety I would like to address the fire that broke out at our Berre, France, site on July 14. We were fortunate to have no injuries and to quickly account for all personnel. The fire was limited to two remote storage tanks. And our assets at Berre continue to run. We're in the process of revaluating the financial losses sustained. Current estimates are in the range of $20 million to $30 million. We're working closely with local authorities to ensure that residents in the area have access to available information. The French authorities have opened a criminal investigation, and we therefore are not in a position to make additional comments. Please turn to slide 6 for our second quarter and last 12 months' EBITDA results. EBITDA in our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment was again near $1 billion. EBITDA in our Olefins and Polyolefins EAI segment was $492 million, a new all-time record. Our Intermediates & Derivatives segment also achieved record results, excluding LCM impacts, with EBITDA of $483 million. We saw typical seasonal increases in our oxyfuels business with large butane cost declines, the return of methanol production at Channelview following first quarter maintenance, and strengthened styrene business. Refining was stable quarter-on-quarter. And the Technology segment results declined by approximately $20 million. During the last 12 months LyondellBasell has generated EBITDA of $8.4 billion, with strong, strong results across all segments. This profitability has been achieved despite a volatile crude oil price environment and is a testament to our portfolio's resilience and stability. Please turn to slides 7 and 8, and I will discuss our cash generation and use. During the second quarter our cash and liquid investments balance increased by approximately $200 million. Cash from operations continued to be very strong, as we generated $1.5 billion from our operations during the period. Cash used for share repurchase and dividends totaled $1.1 billion during the quarter, and capital spending totaled $278 million. We anticipate capital spending of $1.5 billion for the full year. Share repurchases during the second quarter of approximately 8 million shares were somewhat below prior quarters. The number of shares purchased was impacted by an 18% increase in share price during the quarter and by the transition between the completion of the second and the start of the third repurchase authorization. During the past 12 months we generated $6.5 billion in cash from operations, while raising $1 billion from bond issuances and $500 million from commercial paper. Almost $6.3 billion was used for share repurchases and dividends. We invested another $1.3 billion in capital expenditures. Please turn to slide 9, which highlights the magnitude of our free cash flow and the dollars that we have committed to dividends and share repurchases as a percentage of enterprise value as of March 31. As you can see in a little more than four years we have generated approximately 30% of our enterprise value in free cash flow. And distributed this plus an additional 5% to shareholders. On a dollar basis the corresponding free cash flow was $14.5 billion. And accumulative dividends and share repurchases totaled $17.3 billion. By any measure, absolute or relative, these metrics exceed our peers. Please turn to slide 10, and I'll move to a deeper discussion of the underlying segment results. Olefins & Polyolefins Americas second quarter EBITDA was $993 million or $81 million lower than the first quarter. This result marks the fifth consecutive quarter with EBITDA at or near $1 billion. Olefins results declined by $105 million, as margins were adversely impacted by lower coal product prices and higher heavy liquid raw material costs. For example propylene prices declined $0.07 per pound during the quarter. The contribution from our metathesis unit declined by approximately $11 million. During the quarter we had some minor planned and unplanned rate reductions at two Olefins plants. Overall we estimate that this downtime impacted quarterly EBITDA by $30 million. Despite these rate reductions our U.S. Olefins plants ran at approximately 95% of capacity during the quarter. Approximately 90% of our ethylene was produced from NGLs with ethane representing approximately 70% of ethylene production during the quarter. Our propane and butane cracking was fairly consistent quarter-on-quarter. And our ability to process additional volumes was limited by logistics and in-plant processing optimization. During July we implemented logistics changes, which will enable us to increase propane cracking to the levels discussed at Investor Day in April. While Olefins results declined sequentially, Polyolefin results improved by approximately $25 million during the quarter, primarily from increased sales volumes. Polyethylene volume increased approximately 6%, and polypropylene volumes improved 11%. During the quarter we increased polyethylene prices and ended the quarter approximately $0.04 above the March price. Despite this increase the quarterly average price spread over ethylene was relatively constant. Thus far during the first weeks of July, sales and production volumes have been relatively consistent with the end of the second quarter. And NGL and natural gas costs remain low with abundant inventories. During mid-July we began initial production at our 250 million pound per year Channelview ethylene expansion. We don't have any significant maintenance planned during the third quarter. Please turn to slide 11 and a review of Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International. Second quarter EBITDA was $492 million, a new quarterly record, and $135 million higher than the first quarter. Olefin results improved by approximately $80 million. During the quarter industry outages were prevalent, peaking in June when nearly 15% of European capacity was unavailable. We capitalized on this, operating our assets at 97% of capacity. This tight industry supply and demand balance contributed to margin improvement from the first quarter of nearly $0.07 per pound, more than offsetting a rising cost of naphtha. During the quarter we produced nearly 60% of our ethylene from advantaged raw materials, which added approximately $50 million to EBITDA. Combined Polyolefins EBITDA improved by approximately $65 million. Restricted monomer supply and low customer inventories helped to support margins in both our polyethylene and polypropylene businesses. Polyethylene spreads over monomer increased by $0.06 per pound versus the first quarter, and polypropylene spreads were higher by $0.02 per pound. Volumes in polyethylene and polypropylene both declined versus very strong first quarter sales. Polypropylene compound results were lower by approximately $15 million, as margins were compressed by increased polypropylene costs. JV equity income improved $22 million with several of our polyolefin JVs reflecting similar margin improvement trends as our European businesses. July business conditions remain favorable. However the majority of the unplanned industry outages are resolved, and this should alleviate some of the regional product shortages. During September and October we will be taking a planned maintenance outage at our Munchsmunster olefins plant in Germany. Based on current margins we expect this to impact EBITDA by approximately $25 million, spread evenly over the third and fourth quarters. Please turn to slides 12 and 13 for a presentation of regional ethylene industry operating rates. During our recent Investor Day we presented slide 12 with our views on the global ethylene supply/demand balance and operating rates. At the time we expressed a view that industry operating rates were in a transition zone between a balanced and tight market. Second quarter proved this and supports a view that the market may be tighter than depicted, as industry operations have experienced more downtime than the basis for the chart. On slide 13 we're going to take a minute to take the analysis one step deeper by looking at regional operating rates. This slide represents IHS's view on capacity and operating rates in key regions. Based on their respective cost advantages it's reasonable to assume that North American and Middle East regions have been operating at or near their full capacity. During late 2013 and into the first half of 2015 Asia also began to experience increased local margins and effective operating rates. Second quarter turnaround schedule clearly pushed Asia into a tight supply situation, as margins expanded. As we said at our Investor Day we believe that when nameplate capacities approach 90% and effective capacities average in the mid-90% range, the industry typically begins to have pricing power. The European chart on the right implies that Europe operated below these thresholds during 2013 and 2014. However the chart suggests that European operating rates have been increasing and reached levels that were approximately 5% below these thresholds during 2014 and pushing the thresholds during the first half of 2015. Some of this can be attributed to unplanned downtime. If we step back and consider the pie chart of capacity together with regional rates, could paint the picture that most of the spare global capacity is in Europe. European capacity represents approximately 15% of total global capacity. So with utilization rates in Europe approximately 5% lower than the 90% threshold, European spare capacity represents just 1% to 2% of spare global capacity. We seem to be approaching or have already reached a tipping point for product availability and margins. Industry operations and economic activity will determine how this develops over the coming quarters. Now please turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Exclusive of the LCM impacts second quarter EBITDA was a record $483 million, $102 million higher than the first quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results were lower by approximately $20 million and volume declined by 14%. Sales during the first quarter benefited from seasonal aircraft deicer demand and competitor outages. Q2 volumes were consistent with historic averages. Intermediate chemicals performance improved by approximately $55 million. Styrene improved approximately $20 million, as variable margins increased by approximately $0.05 per pound. Volume was lower, as we took planned maintenance at our POSM II facility in Channelview. We estimate that this maintenance impacted second quarter results by approximately $15 million. Acetyl results improved by approximately $30 million, due to higher sales volumes following the first quarter Channelview methanol plant maintenance. The team at our Channelview site have had a very busy and productive first half. They've completed maintenance at our methanol plant, which now runs at benchmark rates. And they also completed a very large and complex POSM turnaround with no safety incidents. We're proud to report that both were done on time and on budget. I wanted to make special mention of this outstanding performance. Oxyfuels results increased by approximately $65 million in Q2 primarily from a typical seasonal margin uplift. Higher demand for octane, rising gasoline prices, and a lower cost of butane drove the majority of the upside. In the lower-right chart you can see the improvement in the industry MTBE raw material margins. July business conditions have generally been similar to conditions experienced late in the second quarter. We will conduct maintenance turnarounds at our La Porte acetyls plant and our French PO/TBA plant beginning late in the quarter. This maintenance will impact the production of propylene oxide, oxyfuels, methanol, vinyl acetate monomer, and acetic acid. We estimate that the total impact of these maintenance activities will negatively impact third quarter EBITDA by approximately $30 million. The fourth quarter impact is currently estimated to be approximately $20 million. Let's move to slide 15 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBTDA was $154 million. Excluding LCM impacts results are unchanged from the prior quarter. During the second quarter the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged nearly $24 per barrel. The realized spread at our refinery was moderately higher than the Maya 2-1-1 spread. Crude throughput averaged 255,000 barrels per day, an increase of 14,000 barrels per day. The higher throughput results \u2013 the higher throughout improved results by approximately $20 million. The volume upside was somewhat dampened by lower secondary product spreads, driven by higher crude oil pricing, RIN costs were lower by approximately $4 million versus the first quarter. Canadian crude oil and light U.S. crude oil were approximately 30% of our crude slate. Our Technology segment generated EBITDA of $57 million during the quarter, a decrease of nearly $20 million. This was the result of lower catalyst volumes from a very strong first quarter level and reduced licensing earnings. Due to the nature and timing of delivery of services under our licensing agreements, it's not uncommon for our earnings in this segment to be variable from quarter to quarter. Q2 results are consistent with the results seen in prior years. Please turn to slide 16. I will briefly summarize, and then I would be happy to take your questions. As I emphasized during April our portfolio has proven to be resilient and providing earnings consistent \u2013 consistent earnings despite market volatility. The strength of our results now spans five quarters with EBITDA at or near $2 billion. Second quarter was a record, both in terms of diluted earnings per share and EBITDA. While ethylene industry conditions were favorable during the second quarter with high global supply/demand, supply is returning to market, yet oil prices have been volatile. Thus far demand and margins have been minimally impacted. Our focus remains unchanged. And differential operating performance has been our hallmark, allowing us to capture value every day and especially when markets enter periods of constrained supply. O&P EAI's second quarter performance demonstrates this capability. Additionally natural gas and NGLs remain abundant and prices remain favorable in the U.S. Overall industry conditions remain favorable. Lastly, our project teams continue to work on the future of LyondellBasell. We're moving forward with our expansions. And we have \u2013 we will have added more than 1 billion pounds to our ethylene capacity over the last 12 months. Additionally we will continue to progress the balance of our projects that will grow the footprint of LyondellBasell and further strengthen our position for the long term. I would now be pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line, Mr. Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Sir, your line is now open. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thanks guys. Congratulations on another good quarter. I guess I wanted to just understand your comments a little bit more. Can you describe the environment you're seeing on the demand side both in North America and in Europe and in Asia in polyethylene, as well as ethylene? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Sure. I mean at this point we still see demand as being relatively strong. Arun, as you know when we have periods of macro volatility, oil price going up or down, it does impact sentiment. And so there are many inventory cycles that we see throughout the year. But if you step back from that demand has grown through the first half year over year in polyolefins globally in the 3% to 4% range. And the U.S. demand growth has been quite strong as has Asia. Europe I would argue has been constrained in Q2 because of less supply. So we're generally constructive on demand for the remainder of the year. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then I guess similarly on the supply side I mean you have some comments that conditions are getting little bit more balanced. What do you expect for the back half of the year on the supply side? I know you guys have some turnarounds. But from what I see it looks like there's a number of planned turnarounds in other parts in some of your competitors. Do you expect supply and demand to again tighten up in the back half of the year? What are you guys looking at there? Thanks. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well we expect that markets will be balanced in the second half. And it's difficult to forecast unplanned outages by definition. So my sense is that unplanned outages would create more tightness. So our focus is \u2013 continues to be on running our plants reliably and being commercially agile. So we're constructive for the second half. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just as a follow-up there is a price increase in polyethylene right now. Do you have any thoughts on whether that could be implemented? And why do you feel that way? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well we continue to monitor and discuss with our customers this $0.05 increase. And we'll just see how it plays out in the coming weeks. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line, Mr. Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks very much. Bob, I was just curious. Obviously you've got an impressive track record of cash flow generation and capital return. You've got a couple more projects on the horizon. But you gave a pretty confident appraisal of the upcycle here for several more years to come. At some point do you take advantage of some of these wounded peer commodity companies and broaden the portfolio? Are you on a perpetual 10% a year share reduction? What do you see as the path forward here if you keep earning at such high cash flow levels? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well as I had mentioned during our last call, Bob, we continue to develop our strategy and sharpen our thinking around the long-term plan for LyondellBasell. In the short term we continue to stay focused on delivering value to shareholders via our regular dividend as well as our share repurchase program. Our balance sheet is very strong. And so we'll continue to evaluate opportunities. In the meantime we're making an acquisition every day. We're buying our shares. And it's an acquisition that we're making at market price, and it's a company we know quite well. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Fair enough. And then on your cracking opportunity you talked a little bit about propane cracking. Do you sense an ongoing shift towards greater flexibility? Or do you expect maybe NGL prices will be fairly correlated amongst each other? So there's only short term opportunities there. And then lastly is the metathesis unit running currently? Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : So in the case of the NGL prices I happen to believe over the long run that they do tend to kind of equilibrate. In the case of propane certainly near term there's a lot of supply. Prices are depressed. We're going to increase propane cracking in the third quarter. We've implemented some pipeline improvements to be able to do that. Longer term, as we've discussed in prior calls, propane can be exported. There will be new PDH capacity coming. So my sense is that propane and ethane values will equilibrate and will compete to be part of the cracker feed slate. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And sorry. Is your metathesis unit running now? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : It's running, but not at full rates. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Bob, just kind of following up on some of your comments about where the industry operating rates are and outages. You guys have had a fantastic record vis-\u00e0-vis others, who've had all the outages. And I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on sort of \u2013 do you think we're having the outages because the industry is running really hard? Or do you think we're having the outages because of the \u2013 much of the asset base is old and may have been underinvested in for a long time? And I guess the bunch of my question is, is do you think the sort of pace of unplanned outages \u2013 and I get it by definition they're hard to predict \u2013 but do you think it's more likely that we continue at this pace going forward? Or do you think now that we've had all these outages and presumably a catch-up in maintenance work and so forth that the asset base might be more reliable over the next 12 months to 18 months? Speaking industry wide. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah, right. Thanks for the question, Vincent. When you think about Europe, the last two years, three years have been very difficult years. And it was not really a call on all of the capacity for most of the industry. Now we've been running more differentially in terms of operating rates over there. My sense is that since reliability was not at a premium, perhaps some of the maintenance were delayed. And so as demand became stronger this year with the weaker euro and some infrastructure spending coming back in Europe, the units didn't respond to the higher call on demand. So will that continue? Difficult to say. But my sense is that the units in Europe especially probably weren't prepared to run at very high rates. In our case \u2013 as you know I was over there for a few years, and we maintained our assets to run at full rates. And in fact we did run at full rates for the past two years. So difficult to predict whether the industry will catch up, or how this will evolve in the next 6 months to 12 months. But I can tell you at the company here, our focus continues on reliable safe operations. And we look \u2013 we start everyday; it sounds like yesterday, but how we perform today and tomorrow. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up, maybe it's more of a clarification question. I thought I heard in your prepared remarks when you discussed the share repurchases in the quarter, obviously you built cash, but that you sort of \u2013 I think you're indicating that the only reason why the share repurchase has sort of slowed down sequentially was because there was a gap in time between the completion of the prior authorization and the grant of the new one. Is that the right read of what you said? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : When you think about our share repurchase program, first of all from an execution standpoint we execute on a dollar basis. And so if you go back to Q1, because the share price was lower we bought back a lot more shares on a dollar-based program, which is what we do with our 10b5 plans. In Q2 we had the transition from the old plan to the new plan, as well as the share price was higher, so we bought back fewer shares. If you step back from the tactics, our focus and our pace has not really changed on share repurchase. It's more a just transitory and share price related. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Sir, your line is now open. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning guys. Question on leadership. One, I was hoping you could kind of update us on the timeline for your CFO search. And then, two, with changeover in I&D and kind of missing a CFO, how confident do you feel or the management team in the near term to kind of get done what you need to do? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Duffy. In the case of the CFO we're advancing very well on this front. I can tell you it's a very high priority for the company and high priority for me personally. So we hope to report some news on that over the coming weeks or months. And in the case of I&D we have \u2013 well look, we have a lot of talent in the company. We have a lot of people that know the business well. We've appointed someone to run the I&D business under the new EVP. This gentlemen who's running I&D has been with the company for 23 years and have a lot of institutional knowledge. So and that generally goes for all management positions. We have a lot of good institutional knowledge in the company that provides great continuity. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then just another one on all the turnaround stuff activity you had going on, whether it was Channelview or the methanol (34:56). A lot of weather issues in Texas in that area. Other companies were having significant delays, some were seeing cost overruns. You talked about not seeing that. Was that just because you got lucky, and weather didn't impact your direct sites? Or were you just able to overcome that? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : No. I think we were impacted by the same weather in Houston. Unfortunately we haven't found a way to build a bubble over Channelview. So I would say that it's really about execution. I think our team at Channelview planned really well for both outages, and they executed the plan. In fact I have asked them to reconstruct how they did that. And that should become the new model in the company. So I think it's great planning and great execution. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Terrific. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Sir, your line is now open. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Thank you. Morning, Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Bob, a question around volumes and inventories. As I take a look at both O&P Americas as well as O&P EAI, there seem to be fairly divergent volume moves sequentially. Right? I mean 6% polyethylene, sequential move up in O&P Americas, 11% for polypropylene. And the converse for O&P EAI, down 11% in polyethylene, down 16% in polypropylene. So just, A, if you could sort of comment on these divergent moves? And, B, just if you could tell us how much of this is restocking/destocking related? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I think most of it is inventory cycle. So if you think about Europe, in Q4 of 2014 there was a very significant inventory depletion going on. And you recall at that time the oil price was dropping. Right? So there was an expectation that the price next week would be lower. And so that's a period when converters tend to deplete inventory. And European converters likely ended with very, very low inventories. As the oil price bottomed and the expectation for price moved from decrease to increase, there was a fairly significant restocking that occurred in Q1, which probably overstated volumes in Q1. And in Q2 in Europe, because of all the unplanned outages, I think some of the demand was probably just constrained due to the lack of supply. So that's why I said earlier, if you just step back from the inventory cycles and look at year-over-year growth, it's fairly consistent across the world. And in the case of Europe polypropylene demand is up about 5% and polyethylene is about 1% year over year. In the case of the U.S. volume is up in Q2 just from seasonal factors. I don't think we had as much of an inventory cycle through year-end 2014 into 2015. Volumes are up as we've gone through the year in 2015 because of seasonality. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Very fair. Now changing gears a bit. I mean you commented a bit earlier on the M&A side of things. Obviously your strategy is very clearly laid out, i.e., the back to basics strategy, whereby if you were to grow it would be within sort of commodity chemicals, and that too I would imagine the low cost side of things. Now in a hypothetical world that in which you were to go out and acquire someone. In terms of the product profile of that company would it have to be a product that you're already in? Or could it be a commodity chemical product, call it chlor-alkali, that you currently don't have a presence in, but you could go out and buy sort of relatively cheap, low cost of production assets? Would that be something you would consider? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well when we think about our strategy and growth going forward, our focus is on our core businesses, and so a large scale commodity integration. But I'll tell you, Hassan, the question that I ask is, whatever it is we would consider acquiring, how is it that we would make those assets better than the current owner in addition to the strategic fit and so on? So those are some of the filters that we use. And we have a certain capability in terms of how we operate and manage our costs. And to the extent that we can apply our model and create unique value with somebody else's assets, then we would consider those things. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Super. Thanks so much, Bob. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Sir, your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Propane prices really collapsed during this quarter. And I understand that ships that carry propane, the deliveries have been delayed. But as those ships get delivered maybe next year, do you see propane prices moving up as we move into 2016? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : So again our view is longer term that ethane and propane will reach more parity on a cost of ethylene basis. We're positioned to take advantage of cheaper propane. But if you think about our cracking capability, we have flexibility to crack a wide range of feedstocks. And that's what we aim for. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. And then if you look at Asian naphtha crack spreads, they are down significantly from the peak, as oil prices have come down. And so you do you think Asian margins will be just a function of oil prices going forward? And then do you have any view on the recently started MTO plants in the region? Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I think Asian margins, if you were asking about polyolefins, they're going to depend as much on supply/demand globally as they will on naphtha prices. And again our sense is that demand growth based on what we see in the first half of the year is solid. And it points to global balance to tight markets in Olefins & Polyolefins. And as far as the new MTO capacity, certainly that adds a little bit more self-sufficiency in the region. But we expect Asia and specifically China to still be a very large importer of polyolefins and specifically polyethylene. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, David. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Bob, in polyethylene for the U.S. do you think the next price move is more likely up or down? And why? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well I think that depends on how demand develops here and the rate of unplanned outages and so on. But there's a few things that I can tell you. There's not a lot of inventory in the chain. And our sense is that economic conditions are pretty good in the U.S. So the magnitude and timing just depends on how the market conditions play out. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And just on I&D, Bob, very strong quarter. Obviously some seasonality with oxys. But how much of this strength is sustainable you think into the back half of the year in I&D, ex the normal seasonal decline in oxyfuels? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well oxyfuels should still be pretty strong through the summer. As you know that's driven a lot by gasoline blending and gasoline season. So we've still got another month or two months. And to the extent that butanes remain as cheap as they are, that adds extra boost to oxyfuel earnings. If you step back more broadly and look at supply/demand for octane, octane is pretty tight. And so that favors our oxyfuel business. So we think cheap butane, tight octane market favors oxyfuels over the long run. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And the rest of I&D? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Rest of I&D should be relatively stable. Styrene monomer has been doing pretty well. Our sense is that that strength in the near term should continue. David, I think the styrene business in general is really a proxy for the nature of our business. It has been underinvested for so long that the demand is finally catching up with supply. And you see more balance between supply and demand in styrene. So I expect consistency in the rest of the business through the year. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Alex Yefremov of Nomura. Your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning everyone. Could you quantify the benefit of additional propane flexibility that you're planning to gain in the next quarter? Maybe in terms of percentage of ethylene produced from propane? And also maybe longer term do you have interest in investing more heavily into propane cracking? Maybe to meaningfully increase your propane ability to benefit through the cycle? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Alex. In the case of our recent increase in propane cracking we have the ability to crack enough propane to produce 5% more of our ethylene from propane, as a result of the latest changes that we've made. Your second question about investing heavily to crack more propane. Again our sense is that NGL values will tend to equilibrate over time. And so we're going to continue to look for inexpensive high return quick projects that allow us to crack more propane. But I don't see us structurally shifting our portfolio for feedstocks focusing only on propane. We want to focus on cracking more NGLs and have the agility to be able to move from one NGL to another depending on the economics, so that we can capture the arbitrage quickly. And that has a lot to do with logistics and having the dedicated pipelines to be able to do that. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. And next question on ethylene derivatives, could you update us on your thinking on the tradeoffs between various derivatives, such as metathesis, polyethylene? And are there any options for you to explore the current ethylene monomer discount that's present in the U.S.? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well we continue to develop our projects on ethylene derivatives. We're very constructive on polyethylene long term. We think given the U.S. cost advantage on NGLs vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world, the cost of ethylene and polyethylene production should be very advantaged in the U.S. We see good demand growth. So to that extent we're advancing a couple of polyethylene expansion projects, one of which will employ our new technology, which will have capability to produce differentiated products. So we're advancing those projects very rapidly. We're continuing to study our \u2013 an expansion of our flex unit, which produces propylene from ethane. So all of those are still continuing. But I can tell you it's with an eye towards end markets, not just about consuming the ethylene that we're producing. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line, Mr. Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is now open. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning and impressive results as usual. Bob, I was struck by your commentary on styrene just now. I guess there had been a thought that with some of the restarts happening in Europe that it might start to cycle down. But you're not really seeing that much weakening in that? Nor are you really expecting too much weakening for the back half of the year in that area? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : So I think, Frank, on styrene it just depends on how the unplanned outages play out. Right. So if there are further unplanned outages that could have an impact \u2013 I know the one POSM unit in the Netherlands will start up here in Q3. So my sense is that I don't think that's enough to tip the global supply/demand balance on the increment. Certainly more supply is coming. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. That's very helpful. And if I could come back to Refining, just to get a little more granularity. Volumes are up nicely sequentially. Your RINs costs were down sequentially. Margins seem to be up a bit, although you did reference secondary product price spreads. How significant was that? And what exactly is that? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well the secondary product prices, that's what we call our capture rate. And that's essentially the value of the co-products compared to the cost of the barrel coming in. So you can imagine if co-product values are relatively stable and oil price comes down, then the value of that co-product as a percent of the oil price rises. And so our capture rate rises. And so that in a lower oil price environment helps us. Sorry. Your second question was? Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Well no. It was just \u2013 so that was the one offset I think to some of the positives in terms of volumes, margins, and lower rates (49:10). Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Right, right. So if you \u2013 correct, correct. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Roberts of UBS. Sir, your line is now open. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Given the pretty good naphtha based ethylene margins in Europe, as those plants have been down for unplanned outages are people investing in better reliability? Or are they just putting Band-Aids on the plants and restarting them? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : So it's difficult to say. But as you can imagine the pressure to restart those is pretty high, given the margin environment. So we'll just have to see how the industry operates going forward. And difficult for me to forecast that. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Well maybe a different question. With the relatively good margins now over there, do you think we're far away from people starting to put some real investment back into some of the facilities? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : It's possible. But you have to remember that investment in crackers takes a long time to realize, even if it is maintenance of existing crackers. Because if it's \u2013 if they have to order long lead equipment, it takes months, maybe a year to get some of the equipment in. And then they have to take a fairly substantial outage. So I suspect that if that were to happen structurally, we wouldn't see a shift until next year some time. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Nils Wallin of CLSA. Sir, your line is now open. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Regarding Olefins Americas, it appeared that your benchmark realizations, polyethylene and polypropylene spreads and ethylene was a little bit less than what you guys had done last quarter. Yet of course raw materials were down even more. So I was wondering if you would be able to tell us what caused a lower realization on the benchmark? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Hey good morning, Nils. It's just mix effects. I don't think there's anything specific in terms of the change from quarter to quarter. It could be product mix. It's export versus domestic sales. Those kind of things. Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : And, Nils, this is Doug. I mean you also have to remember that benchmarks are put in place when the price increase is announced and accepted. And reality, the industry always has contracts in times where it kind of comes in over a little bit more time. So what you've probably seen is the benchmark overstating things a little bit, that's all. Not uncommon at all. It's sort of the standard thing. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Sure, sure. Now with respect to sort of the high-cost producer in Asia, we obviously \u2013 Brent has come off significantly. And yet you have certainly had a fair number of outages in Asia and Europe that helped the prices stay elevated. Would you care to opine as to once this capacity comes online with this lower level of Brent, what type of price pressure you might see out in Asia? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Again I think it's \u2013 in fact, Nils, I think it's difficult to assess exactly how that will go. But it's not \u2013 first of all it's not a large amount of capacity. It may or may not start up on time. Again our sense is that global operating rates are north of 90% or around 90%. So I don't think it'll have a tremendous impact on global markets. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. And just one final one if I may. And we've seen kind of polypropylene margins rise both in U.S. and Europe. I know there's probably some changes in the contracts. But are we at a fundamentally different level for polypropylene margins? Or are we in a period of where they're perhaps overrunning due to outages? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Polypropylene demand has grown more than polyethylene demand this year globally. So it has been quite strong. Part of that is because polypropylene price and polyethylene price have come relatively closer together. So there could be a bit of product substitution on the incremental growth, and that occurs year over year. In the U.S. specifically with propylene price dropping and firm polypropylene markets, they do have a bit of margin expansion in polypropylene. Will that persist? Again polypropylene here has been underinvested. So as demand rises we reach operating rate environment where operating rates are north of 90%, and propane is cheap. So as long as that continues then I would say polypropylene margins are probably in a different regime than they were in the past. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. Thanks very much. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mr. Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. I have two quick ones. Can you just remind us on how much of a EBITDA tailwind you had from the advantaged feedstocks in Europe? And secondly, given the 5-year view of fairly tight operating conditions why not from \u2013 why \u2013 can you clarify why not frontloading the CapEx to bring on capacity more quickly to take advantage of that? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : So on the value of the advantaged feedstocks. In Q3 there was about $50 million of tailwind. In terms of CapEx we're executing at a very high rate right now in our growth plan. So truly about prioritization, how much can we get done? And so on. But I can tell you that we're executing at a fairly high level on capital this year. And the coming years will be very active for us. So our priority remains on U.S. expansions in cracker debottlenecks and in polyethylene. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : If we have no further questions, then I want say thank you for your questions and let me close with a few remarks. First, we delivered record results in Q2. And we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter with EBITDA of $2 billion. Our priorities remain consistent. We're focused on safe, reliable, cost efficient operations. We aim to deliver relative outperformance in any market environment. We're continuing to execute on our growth program. As I've mentioned we just started up our Channelview debottleneck. We have Corpus Christi next year. We have another Channelview debottleneck and polyethylene expansions coming. From a shareholder perspective we remain committed to return value to shareholders by way of our next 10% share repurchase program. We expect to execute that over the next 10 months to 14 months. And our strategy and focus continue to prove very resilient in any market environment. So thank you for your interest in our company. And we'll speak with you again at the next call. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Tori. Well, welcome to LyondellBasell's third quarter 2015 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO, and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions. But before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on the website at www.lyb.com. Now, finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time today until 11 :59 Eastern Time on November 23, by calling 800-856-2254 in the United States and 402-280-9961 outside of the United States. And the pass code for both numbers is 5671. During today's call we'll focus on third quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like again to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we've discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are somewhat unique to our 2010 company formation, when all assets and liabilities were measured at fair value, our use of LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in crude oil prices and prices for many of our raw materials and finished goods inventories. And during the third quarter, we recognized in LCM charges totaling $181 million. Now, comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of this LCM inventory charges. With that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's take a look at slide 4 and review a few financial highlights from this record third quarter. Third quarter earnings per share was $2.80, with EBITDA of $2.2 billion. This quarterly diluted EPS figure is another new, all-time high for LyondellBasell. And as represented by the orange lines in the lower-left chart, our EBITDA has now averaged approximately $2 billion in each of the last six quarters. Additionally, we have achieved 12 consecutive quarters of year-over-year EBITDA growth. This sustained level of earnings has translated into diluted EPS during the past 12 months of $10.60 per share. Achieving these record results during a period of slow economic growth and a volatile hydrocarbon environment speaks to the balance in our portfolio. We remain focused on safe, reliable operations and cost discipline. Our results support these statements and continue to surpass most, if not all, within the chemical space. In fact, our cash flow and shareholder-friendly policies not only standout within the industry, but also among S&P 500 companies. Our dividend yield play successfully within the top 15% of the S&P 500 and our share repurchase program is in the top 4%. Turning to slide number 5, you'll see that our safety performance year-to-date remains slightly ahead of 2014. We continue to operate as a top decile performer and a safety leader in the chemical industry. While we're proud of our safety performance, we're not at all satisfied. Our goal remains zero incidents. Our discipline around safety that the strong tone defines who we are, and we believe translates into both operational and financial success. Please turn to slide 6 for our third quarter and last 12 months EBITDA results. EBITDA in our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment was again in excess of $900 million. The Olefins and Polyolefins EAI and Intermediates and Derivatives segments each produced record EBITDA results for the second consecutive quarter. Olefins & Polyolefins EAI EBITDA totaled $555 million, as supply-demand balances in Europe remained tight early in the third quarter and moved to be to a more balanced position as the quarter closed. The Intermediate and Derivative segment recorded EBITDA of $506 million, strength in propylene oxide and styrene helped to offset seasonally lower oxyfuels results and scheduled maintenance activity. Refining EBITDA declined by $11 million, but results in this segment have been relatively stable throughout the year. Year-to-date EBITDA is $451 million, $75 million ahead of 2014 results. The Technology segment results declined by approximately $12 million, but are on a pace again to exceed $200 million for the full year. During the last 12 months, we've generated EBITDA of $8.5 billion. The composition of this EBITDA is in the lower right hand part of slide 6. EBITDA has been fairly steady across quarters. This has been achieved despite a volatile crude oil price environment and again as a testament to our portfolio's resilience and stability. As the chart shows, all segments contributed to our success. Please turn to slide 7 and 8 and I will discuss cash generation and cash use. Cash from operations continue to be very strong as we generated $1.8 billion from our operations during this period, an increase of more than $300 million from the prior quarter. Cash used for share repurchases and dividends totaled $1.7 billion. Share repurchases during the third quarter totaled 15.5 million shares or approximately 3.3% of the outstanding shares. During the quarter, capital spending totaled $373 million. We anticipate capital spending of approximately $1.4 billion for the full year 2015. During the past 12 months we generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations, while raising $1 billion from a bond issuance, and utilized $500 million of our commercial paper program. $6.3 billion were used for share repurchases and dividends during this period. $4.9 billion or 73% of our cash flow was used for share repurchases, reducing our outstanding shares by 56.3 million, or approximately 11%. Dividend payments totaled $1.4 billion. We also invested approximately $1.4 billion in CapEx with about half of this amount dedicated to growth projects. Before I comment on the performance of each of our segments, I wanted to make two broader observations. First, the quarter was characterized by generally stable volume across our portfolio. The second is that while margins in some product areas declined, some seasonally, other products improved. As a result, we generated another strong, stable quarter despite the oil price volatility and during a period where olefins and polyolefins market conditions shifted from tight supply-demand toward a more balanced market environment. Please turn to slide 9 as we look deeper into the segment results. Olefins and Polyolefins Americas' third quarter EBITDA was $920 million or $73 million lower than the second quarter. As a result of the rebalancing market and declining crude oil price, results declined from very strong second quarter levels as the third quarter progressed. Versus the second quarter, Olefins results declined by approximately $140 million as our average quarterly ethylene price declined by approximately $0.06 per pound. This downside was somewhat mitigated by a lower cost of ethylene production. Our U.S. Olefins plants ran at 94% of capacity during the quarter, in line with the second quarter. Our metathesis unit operated at reduced rates and its contribution declined by $6 million quarter-on-quarter. Approximately 90% of our ethylene was produced from NGLs with ethane representing approximately 65% of ethylene production during the quarter. Propane and butane cracking accounted for 22% of ethylene production. While Olefins results declined sequentially, Polyolefins results improved by approximately $70 million during the third quarter. Polyethylene spreads increased $0.02 per pound and polypropylene spreads increased $0.04 per pound during the third quarter. Polyethylene volume was steady and polypropylene volume declined 5%, partially as a result of maintenance at our Lake Charles facility. During the first weeks of the fourth quarter, the market remains balanced. Natural gas costs have declined from second quarter levels, while NGL costs have increased seasonally but still remain low. Inventories of both remain abundant. Sales and production volumes have been relatively consistent with the end of the third quarter. As you can see on the lower left on slide 9, third quarter price declines have led industry consultants to forecast lower ethylene chain margins. We do not have planned fourth quarter maintenance, but we intend to build inventory for the first quarter of Corpus Christi steam cracker turnaround and expansion, which will add 800 million pounds to our annual ethylene capacity. We estimate that this inventory build will negatively impact fourth quarter results by approximately $30 million. In addition, we declared force majeure in polypropylene due to a site-wide power loss in our Bayport plant. Bayport polypropylene accounts for approximately 15% of our global polypropylene capacity and approximately half of our North American capacity. Please turn to slide 10 and a review of our Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $555 million, another quarterly record and $63 million higher than the second quarter. Olefin results improved by approximately $60 million. Ethylene continued to remain tight early in the third quarter and prices were relatively constant. Margins increased approximately $0.06 per pound primarily from a lower cost of ethylene production due to lower feedstock costs. During the quarter, we operated our assets at 92% of capacity excluding planned maintenance at our M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster, Germany Olefins plant. We estimated that this maintenance impact impacted third quarter results by approximately $15 million during the quarter. We produced approximately 65% of our ethylene from advantaged raw materials, adding approximately $30 million to EBITDA over naphtha cracking. Combined Polyolefins EBITDA improved by approximately $20 million. An increase in polypropylene price spreads of $0.02 per pound and 9% higher polypropylene volume more than offset the 4% lower polyethylene volume. Polypropylene compounds results were lower by approximately $10 million. Volume was seasonally lower and margins were compressed by increasing polypropylene costs. JV equity income was relatively constant. The third quarter was characterized by rebalancing in both Olefins and Polyolefins markets, as the industry came off the high rate of outages that defined the second quarter. Volume continued to remain at second quarter levels, but margins in September closed lower than where they started the quarter. To this point, October margins, as forecasted by IHS, are located on the lower-left side of slide 10, have come off of the levels of the third quarter. Typically during the fourth quarter, the benefit from advantaged feedstocking declines and Polyolefin volumes decline seasonally with converter holiday downtime. The maintenance outage at our M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster olefins plant is scheduled to continue through October. Based on current margins, we expect this to impact fourth quarter EBITDA by approximately $15 million. Now, please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Exclusive of the LCM impacts, third quarter EBITDA was a record $506 million, $23 million higher than the second quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results were higher by approximately $30 million as lower feedstock and other variable costs led to the margin improvement. Intermediate chemicals performance also improved by approximately $30 million. Styrene results improved approximately $30 million as margins remained strong and volume increased following the conclusion of the planned maintenance at one of our propylene oxide styrene monomer plants at Channelview. C4 chemical volumes also improved. Acetyl results declined by approximately $20 million due to planned maintenance at our La Porte acetyls plant. Oxyfuels results followed typical seasonal patterns and decreased by approximately $30 million. To-date, October demand has been similar to third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we generally see seasonal margin declines in our oxyfuels and C4 chemicals businesses as butane becomes more expensive due to winter gasoline branding. As you can see on the slide, this year is not an exception. During the quarter, we will complete the maintenance turnarounds at our French PO/TBA plant and at our La Porte, Texas acetyls plant. This maintenance will impact the production of propylene oxide, oxyfuels and acetyls. We estimate that the total impact of these maintenance activities will negatively impact full quarter EBITDA by approximately $20 million. Let's move to slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. This quarter, third quarter EBITDA was $143 million, excluding LCM impacts, results are $11 million lower than the prior quarter. During the third quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged nearly $23 per barrel. The realized spread at our refinery was moderately higher than the Maya 2-1-1 spread, but approximately $1 lower than the second quarter. Crude throughput averaged 249,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 6,000 barrels per day. Canadian crude oil and light U.S. crude oil made up approximately 30% of our crude slate. During the fourth quarter, we are expecting maintenance at the refinery to impact fourth quarter EBITDA by $15 million to $20 million. Our Technology segment generated EBITDA of $45 million during the quarter, a decrease of $12 million. This was primarily the result of lower licensing earnings. Please turn to slide 13 and I'll briefly summarize the quarter. Third quarter earnings was another all-time record and marked the sixth consecutive quarter with EBITDA of approximately $2 billion. We again delivered record earnings per share to our shareholders and we continue to deliver industry-leading cash returns. Our operating excellence is the enabler and our balanced portfolio continues to deliver strong steady earnings and cash generation. During the third quarter, we returned nearly $1.7 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends. I describe the third quarter and the transitional market. The supply constraint of the second quarter transitioned to a more balanced market during the third quarter. As a result, there was some margin compression as the quarter progressed. Looking ahead, during the fourth quarter, we typically experience seasonal slowdowns in our Oxyfuels, Polyolefins and Refining businesses. Overall, we continue to see ethylene markets that are balanced. Thus far, sales volumes remained similar to the third quarter pace. During the fourth quarter, we will complete three ongoing turnarounds, and our Bayport polypropylene plant has resumed production. However, the force majeure remains in place in polypropylene. As we look ahead into the first half of 2016, we remain encouraged by what we see. The next several slides help explain our optimism. First, as shown on slide 14, the current oil-to-gas ratio remains healthy and well above the pre-shale average. This represents the U.S. shale advantage, and we remain well positioned to continue benefiting from it. Along with this cost advantage, we continue to benefit from an abundant supply of natural gas and NGLs. The markets that we serve also lead us to be optimistic. Demand for our products, approximately two-thirds of which go into consumable end users, remained steady. Our products are relied upon for fuel, food packaging and other diverse everyday end uses. Mid-markets grow consistently and in excess of global GDP, as you can see in the graphs on the right of slide 15. In the past 25 years, global polyethylene and polypropylene demand has grown year-over-year in all but one year, 2008, and we know how severe that recession was. Earlier in the call, I mentioned fourth-quarter seasonality and transitioning to a balanced order. But we also need to look further ahead. Slide 16 provides a view of global industry supply-demand. Operating rates in 2016 are projected to be very similar to 2015, with ethylene effective operating rates, again, above 90%. This suggests a balanced-type market, depending on industry operating reliability which, over the past two years, has not been that strong. Please turn to slide 17. As the fourth quarter trends lower due to seasonality, we typically see a demand increase during spring and restocking occurs. This pickup in demand coincides with planned maintenance and we could again see another period of supply tightness in the first half of 2016. It would not be unreasonable for the first half of 2016 to look similar to the first half of 2015. With that, I'm now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. The price of ethane today is $0.20 a gallon which equates to about $3 per MMBTU and the price of natural gas at Henry Hub order of magnitude is $2.40. And if ethane were trading or were priced with natural gas, it would be at $0.15 a gallon. And there is, I don't know, 500,000 barrels of ethane a day being rejected. So, it seems like there's plenty of ethane, yet a premium has been built into the ethane price. Do you have an opinion on why that is? Do you find it puzzling or straightforward? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Our sense is that ethane demand increased as Q3 progressed, as propane fell more out of favor, propane prices rising through the quarter, so demand increased and I think the rejection rates that you quoted are in line with our views, 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day. This price margin should encourage more of that ethane to come to market. And I would suspect that, over time, we would see ethane trade back closer to fuel value. So, I'd see this, Jeff, as really more transitional. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, for my follow-up, a good portion of your increase in EBITDA year-over-year came from your European operations. And in Europe, this was a year where there were all kinds of operational issues. How much of the improvement do you see year-over-year as being due to transitory events and how much do you see it as being due to steps that you've taken to improve the business in a more durable way? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Part of the improvement in Europe is improvement in demand year-over-year. But I would say that the restructuring work that we've undertaken over the past three years, four years, has really provided the foundation for this increase in earnings. Having said that, a weaker euro, lower naphtha price does increase competitiveness of Europe. So, our end use customers are more competitive in export markets, for example, for film. So, we've seen, polypropylene demand grow very solidly year-over-year, and polyethylene is incrementally higher year-over-year. I think those are all the factors and with lower oil price and weak euro, we expect that Europe should do pretty well. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks very much. Bob, I noticed in your ethylene forecast there, it looks like you've got operating rates. You're going to sustain a pretty consistent level here assuming ongoing downtime in the industry. Is there a reason not to simplistically assume that you should be able to continue booking this $2 billion quarterly EBITDA numbers? Or do you think there's some further leg up here as you bring on some new capacity or maybe do some other things with the portfolio? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : In terms of unplanned outages, Bob, it's difficult to really forecast those, right? So, we don't know what's going to happen next year. But the history is any indicator \u2013 recent history is any indicator, then next year's additional planned outages will create some firmness in markets. We'll just have to see how that develops. We do have more capacity coming on next year with our Corpus Christi expansion. So, we'll take a fairly large turnaround in the first half of the year as we bring that expansion on line, and then we'll have more operational leverage in ethylene in the second half of the year. So, I'm not sure if I answered your question, Bob, but we will just have to see how the operating reliability develops in the first half. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: If I might ask a follow-up. On slides 9 and 10, you show your U.S. or Americas and then the Europe metric. I found it interesting that in the third quarter, naphtha- and ethane-based spreads were the same. And then European and U.S. spreads were nearly the same. Do you think going forward, as you go through the next few years here, that you're going to see the European spread continue to be close to North America? Or do you think that was sort of a one-off because of those extraordinary shutdowns in the first half of 2015? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I think in third quarter, it was more than just about the tightness in the market. We also had a declining naphtha price which increased margins. As you know, we have a price lag on our ethylene price settlements. So, we settle price on ethylene at the beginning of the month. We buy feedstock throughout the month and in a falling price environment, we tend to benefit. So, there's some of that in the third quarter. I would not expect it to be that strong in future quarters. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Thanks, guys. So, just wanted to clarify a couple of your comments. So, I think a lot of us have kind of witnessed the loosening supply/demand over the third quarter and expect a lower fourth quarter. At the end of the call, you noted that the first half of 2016 could look like the first half of 2015. What drives that comment? I guess what are the factors that go into your expectation there? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, as we sit here today, Arun, I think inventories are average at best, maybe below average in the value chain. We see buyers only buying what they need. We don't see them buying ahead. Seasonally, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we tend to see demand decline in November/December, fourth quarter seasonal effects. Easily, we see spring pickup, not only in demand but then restocking of inventory to meet that higher level of demand. I don't expect next year to be any different. The year-over-year planned outages on the ethylene side, they're higher in 2016. And if demand grows year-over-year, then all of that points to tighter markets in 2016 compared to 2015. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. And on the cash flows, you're still generating very strong cash flow. If you're at a similar level next year, what are the plans and priorities for that cash flow? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, our cash flow deployment priorities have been relatively consistent and I don't expect those to change next year. We'll do growth CapEx where we see opportunity to leverage advantaged feedstock or technology and have a stable growing dividend. And then beyond that, share repurchase is a very good option for us, so I suspect that we would continue in the same rhythm as we have in the past. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Would it be possible to comment whether you'd be announcing any further new projects or considering M&A as well? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : On the project side, we're advancing discussions with our board and we're developing a few different projects and as we're ready to discuss those, we'll certainly do that next year. On M&A, our view has not changed from prior calls. My view is that M&A, first of all, competes with share buyback and our organic growth program. In the case of our organic growth program, we're leveraging local advantage through doing debottlenecks, not greenfield when it comes to ethylene expansion. So, that's a fairly high bar. Share buyback is also a fairly high bar because when we buy back shares, we're buying back something we know every day and we're buying at market. So, M&A would have to have significant synergy potential, would have to be accretive. And so, we continue to evaluate things on all fronts, but we think our organic growth program and share repurchase set pretty high bars. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Bob, on slide 9, you highlight polypropylene margins. Can you discuss the drivers of the expansion and your view of the sustainability of these higher margins in polypropylene? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, David. Polypropylene has been underinvested for the past few years, especially in the U.S. and in Europe. And this is the first year we've seen really significant growth, globally, in polypropylene. A part of that could be that polypropylene price has come down some and it's more competitive with ethylene, especially in the U.S. But we're definitely seeing demand growth in polypropylene. And with the prospects of capacity in the near term not changing a whole lot, polypropylene market in the U.S. and to even some degree in Europe, is structurally balanced and headed towards very tight markets. And I expect that will continue over the next year or two. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And Bob, just heading into (33:02) November, there are some polyethylene price increases on the table. What's your sense for the potential for those to be successful? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : My sense of the market environment at the moment is that our order book is pretty full. We see demand being solid here in the U.S. Inventories are low. So, we just have to see how this develops, but markets seem pretty firm as we sit here today. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Hi. Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): My first question is on styrene. It's not a market we have talked about a lot on these calls, but that profitability has improved. And, at least in the quarter, it more than offset the decline in MTBE. So, maybe, can you add a little bit color on the styrene market? What is the sort of approximate EBITDA you make there? I know it's a co-product. And then, what's the outlook for next 6 to 12 months? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, in terms of supply/demand for styrene, as you know, it's been very underinvested for years. In fact, demand was shrinking for styrene and derivatives for some time. We now see demand increasing year-over-year. It's been underinvested for quite a long time. And there had been some unplanned outages, as you know, in the Netherlands, there was a POSM unit that had a fairly significant incident which has created more tightness in the styrene market. Our sense is that the styrene market will remain balanced if not tight, much like I described polypropylene with a prior question. Of course, as that capacity in the Netherlands returns to the market, that will ease some of the tightness, but we do expect year-over-year demand growth. And also, you have to remember that benzene prices come off a bit as oil price came off in the third quarter, so, that also helps margins. But we're constructive on styrene. We haven't said that in a long time. But the styrene market looks decent to us. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. And then, my next question, Bob, is on NGLs. As some of these propane export terminals begin to ship propane, what's your outlook on propane, and do you think that ethane becomes more advantaged next year compared to propane? Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, in the case of both propane and butane, we have to consider seasonality in terms of the competitiveness with ethane. So, in the summer months, we're going to see propane and butane be more competitive and then, in the winter months, less so. The export capacity for propane is increasing, but I don't think it's increasing at a pace where propane becomes disadvantaged. As long as both propane and butane are of abundant supply, then I think they'll compete to be in the cracker slate. And, of course, coal products play a big role in this. So, as propane cracking decreases incrementally going into the winter, we should see less propylene production and that should change the outlook for propylene prices. So, you kind of have to think about the coal products in all of this as well. But my sense is that propane and ethane will be near each other in terms of competitiveness in the cracker. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, fellows. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: A question kind of on the split between profitability in your integrated ethylene chains. Obviously, I think it surprised everybody how much has kind of moved downstreams in the polyethylene from the ethylene side. Do you find that transitory or do you think that that's kind of a structural shift we'll see persist over the next three, four or five years? And then how would that affect your desire to be there net long or net short ethylene? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, I think in the near term, that's more transitory. It's local conditions and situations. As you know, PVC is a large consuming derivative of ethylene, and when the PVC producers are exporting more, they can certainly afford to \u2013 ethylene at the prices where it is today. Longer term, definitely, we're watching to see how some of these announcements develop. As you know, it takes a lot less time to build derivative capacity than it does ethylene capacity. We intend to be a merchant seller of ethylene long term in a similar proportion as we are today. So, we still think that that's an important part of our portfolio. We'll continue to evaluate derivatives and we are as we speak. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then maybe one for Doug. Just on the Corpus Christi turnaround next year as we're modeling that. With the inventory build, with the downtime and then kind of ramping back up, how should we think about that affecting year-over-year numbers? Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : Yes. Well, definitely, the first they do, a good comparison is somewhat like the La Porte turnaround that we did, right? We built inventory for that, then we had it down. And it's going to be an extensive turnaround, but is not only the turnaround but the expansion. So, if you can think of it in terms of maybe a 90-day or maybe a little bit longer, shorter turnaround, the inventory builds, what we're really doing is we're buying ethylene now, putting it in inventory, that's why you see the fourth quarter financial impact, and then that'll come out of the inventory as the turnaround proceeds. So, I think those things will guide you through kind of how to model and how to balance it as we go forward with that. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Bob, big spread has opened up between contract ethylene and spot ethylene in the United States and it's a lot wider than normal. Could you sort of discuss what's causing that and what gives you the confidence that we're not going to see the contract price leak down to where the spot price is? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Vincent. At spot ethylene, let me first frame the markets. So, the spot ethylene market accounts for about 10% from the total volume produced in the U.S. Now that includes both paper and physical trades. If you just look at the physical volume, it's like 5% to 7% of the total production, so that's quite small. It's a very thin market in the end. And so, near-term price movements, like we saw in the second half or the third quarter, those can be influenced by very local logistics-type issues, different producer issues, or whatever that might be. But I don't see this as being something that's structural. In fact, if you look at the forward curve on ethylene, it is in contango and it points upwards. So our sense is that this is just kind of a local situation. And then if you step back and look at next year's supply-demand balance on ethylene and the number of outages that are planned in Q1, my sense is that the market remains balanced to tight. And again, we'll have to see how operability develops. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up, is there any update on the CFO search? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yes. Well, that just remains a high priority for us and we were closing in on a selection. We didn't want to rush into this and we continue to advance all of our finance-related matters. So, stay tuned, we're getting close. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Mr. Byrne, your line is now open. You may want to check if you're on mute, sir. All right. Thank you. Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura. Your line is open. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Was polypropylene market being tight? Is there any opportunity for Lyondell to restart some of the older plans that had been idled in the past, either in the U.S. or Europe? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yes. Good morning, Alex. We're not so much looking at that as we are debottleneck opportunities, as you know. That's been kind of the hallmark of our expansion program, and we have a few possibilities there. So, we'll evaluate that. And this is more of a recent development, meaning in the last two to three quarters. So, we're starting to think about our capacity and the potential here in the U.S. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. And continuing the seam of merchant ethylene market, with the upcoming expansion of Corpus Christi, do you have that extra ethylene \u2013 do you have a buyer for that extra ethylene or you'll need to place it into the market on a spot basis? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : No. We've already contracted quite a bit of that volume and we have ongoing discussions, as we're a merchant seller and have been for quite some time. So, that just comes into our portfolio and a lot of it is already placed. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group : Yes. Thank you. Bob, we've seen propylene pricing come in quite a bit, and relative to ethylene, it's on its lowest levels since 2009 kind of pre the shell boom. So, what impact does is this having on line though? For example, that $140 million sequential decline in U.S. olefins, how much would be due to lower co-product credits? And then with this lower relative propylene price, I know that in the past, you talked about perhaps expanding your metathesis unit. Is that kind of on hold now? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, so in terms of propylene price, first of all, with higher propane cracking and that's what increased the supply of propylene. In terms of the impact on our results, we were just \u2013 as I mentioned during my remarks that we did run the flex or metathesis unit at lower rates. We'll have to watch how well this develops. I suspect, as we work through the next few months and propane is currently out of favor, we should see propylene rise. It has happened already. It's going to depend on supply-demand for propylene, of course. Longer term, the metathesis unit, that is one of the projects that we have that we're studying. We have to take a longer-term view rather than just what happened this month or this quarter. So, we'll kind of step back and look at propylene balances and our need for propylene, especially in light of a stronger polypropylene business here in the U.S. So, that's still an option, and that's something we'll look at with a longer-term view. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group : Then just a follow up, with the shift \u2013 industry shift in Europe to more propane usages. Has that reduced the effect of capacity industry by a couple points? Do you think that's one of the reasons behind some of the better-than-expected margins you're seeing in Europe beyond just the outages? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : It doesn't impact the ethylene output there as much as it does the coal products like propylene or butadiene, and even that is very incremental. So, I suspect it's not really the driver for some of the things you're seeing in Europe. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Morning, Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : A two-part question on methanol if I may. First question is how \u2013 one of your priorities, obviously, was better for the corporations or better running at the Channelview facility. So, how is that going? So, that's part one. The second part is that, obviously, you've been talking about evolving tightness within the ethylene side of things. As I understand it, there are roughly 3 million tons of MTO capacity that was supposed to come on line this year. But owing to volatility, a lot of that Chinese capacity has not come online. How does that fit in to your thinking as one thinks about 2016? Will those facilities start coming back on line? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : All right. So, first of all, on the Channelview methanol plant, it's running very well. We've been running at benchmark rates. So, I would say that our issues that we had in last year have been resolved, and I'm really proud of how well that plant is running today. And given where margins have been, we've virtually paid for that restart, so those are very quick payback for us. In terms of the supply/demand balance for methanol, I still see the U.S. as being an importer of methanol. Market balances, we don't think change a whole lot in the next year or so. As this decade develops, it's possible that the U.S. will become an exporter of methanol if all this capacity that's been announced will come on line. MTO plants, they are under construction or coming up in China. The demand is growing as well. So, our sense is that at least next year, methanol supply-demand balance is reasonable for the U.S. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Perfect. And as a follow up on methanol sort of derivative side of things, you talked a bit about acetic margin sort of compressing a bit through the course of Q3. Now, obviously, methanol pricing is lower and continues to go down. But the flipside is that, obviously, acetic supply-demand balances remain quite slack as well. How should we be thinking about sort of 2016 asset yields or profitability for next year-on-year? Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : Hassan, it's Doug. I mean, I think our reference to the asset yields, of course, encompasses methanol. So, when we talk about being down, it's more turnaround related as where we were referencing. We've got the La Porte facility which includes a methanol plant and acetic and then in turnaround that's going to come up pretty shortly. But that's what we're referring to in the comments. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Unknown Speaker : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Mr. Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. With respect to the oil-to-gas ratio chart you have in there, with oil production continuing to increase, how close to parity you think we get there? Just how do you think that chart moves as we go forward? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I mean, if you look at the natural gas price where it is today, we're sub-$2.40 on Henry Hub. It's difficult to predict where oil price will go on the near term; but longer term, certainly. There's a lot of production in the world that's underwater at $45. So, my sense is that longer term oil price should come up, it's a question of when and the time that we take to get there. But if you think about natural gas, it's very abundant in the U.S. and so we think this ratio is pretty resilient in different oil price environment. Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. And also, on the ethylene supply-demand balances that you're showing, how much of the production of ethylene is going to be for domestic markets versus export markets in your view? Do we have more growth internationally and is that what absorbs the capacity? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yes, you really have to look at ethylene derivatives because we don't really ship ethylene as monomer. We do, but not in material quantities. So the U.S. ethylene production increase later in the decade, will really meet global demand increase for PVC, for polyethylene, for MEG, and so on. And so, when you look at those markets, there's not a lot of ethylene expansion elsewhere in the world. Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Your line is now open. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. As you noted that there are a fair number of ethylene turnarounds next year, but there are also a fair number of polyethylene start-ups. So, I'm just curious how you're thinking about the interplay between those two and what that effect might have on the PE spread over ethylene? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Nils. The polyethylene expansions, I think they're in the second half of next year; most of them are. And those expansions, in the month that they start up, there may be a little bit of disruption, but our sense is if you look at markets at a global basis, there's enough demand growth based on the trend that we've been on to absorb that new capacity. So, could there be some change in the month? Perhaps, but we think that this capacity will be absorbed. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. And then, obviously, your comment just on the question before was instructive in terms of your long-term view around oil prices. However, in the medium or short term, rig counts have come down, and efficiency is decelerating. So, do you have a view on how all that might \u2013 in the U.S. that is, how all that might affect the NGL supply? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : So far, Nils, we don't see a whole lot of impact on NGL supply. I think it's still abundant. As I mentioned earlier, in response to one of the other questions, that ethane rejection still is north of 400,000 barrels a day. That's enough to feed five to six world-scale crackers. And some frac margin will probably bring even more supply to market. So, our sense, so far, not much impact on NGL supply. But we'll continue to watch it. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Rory Blake - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. This is actually Rory Blake sitting in for Frank Mitsch. Just a couple of questions following up. You guys spoke about demand improving in Europe. When you think about the global pace, this constant demand growth, has there been any change in terms of regional strength or how would you guys characterize maybe how things trended through the quarter? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Demand was pretty strong through the quarter in Europe on polyolefins. Now, you have to remember, that normally in July and August, there are pretty significant holiday periods that occur in North Europe, South Europe at different times. If you were to kind of take that out, year-over-year demand was stronger this year than it was last year. So, we're pretty constructive on where polyolefins demand is in Europe. Rory Blake - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just following up on the feedstock commentary. Obviously, it seems like the NGL view is to be long in the U.S. But given where you saw things trend, maybe in the middle of the year with propane coming off extremely strong. Do you see further investment opportunities to enhance your flexibility or do you think that's kind of everything is going to be parity longer term? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : We do find incremental opportunities to increase flexibility. We're going to do some work at Channelview to increase flexibility to crack propane. I continue to believe that flexibility will be the key going forward. There are going to be times when propane is favored like it was this summer and then ethane and so on. What I would say, it's more incremental flexibility improvement. We've already done a lot of work in the past two years, three years. Rory Blake - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much for your time, gentlemen. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. I was curious about your comment, always wanting to be net long on ethylene. I assume that's in excess of you metathesis capacity and many players like that have a more tapered integration strategy. So, why would you like to be long ethylene even in excess of metathesis? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I think it gives us an opportunity to, first of all, to optimize, right? I mean, we can participate in the spot market when it's strong via either merchant sales or spot sales. We can increase or decrease metathesis production or propylene production. It gives us another knob, if you will, in terms of optimization. But we're not significantly long. I think our length has been consistent over the past four or five years. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And secondly, I assume M&A activity still doesn't compete anywhere close to share buybacks? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Our share buyback program looks pretty attractive to us at this point. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I have a follow up on the MTBE side. You were talking about seasonal weakness on MTBE going forward. But a lot of the driving the MTBE price has been the octane premium. And the octane premium the last couple of quarters has been, I think, the highest that it's ever been. Do you have any comments on that dynamic and well, where we can expect that to be next year in the summer? Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : Hey, Jonas. This is Doug. We agree that the octane premium has been very strong and we think octane is going to remain in demand. If you think about the developing world, you think about the way crude is developing, shale produces quite a bit of high-vapor pressure, lower octane components, engine technologies driving towards needs for more octane. So, that's why we feel quite good about it. Our comments, really, around MTBE and butane are you do see, though, a seasonal thing. This is something, I guess, I've watched for 25 years. Seasonally, what happens is when you hit the winter months, there's demand for butane, both for gasoline blending and cooking, so, you pull up butane a little bit. And gasoline demand comes off a little bit. So, it usually comes off a little bit. So, those two bases are trends that you'll see. This year, so far, is no different than, really, most years. You see that strong summer period. And they'll come off a little bit. And then, you'll see in the spring, we, typically, will see it move back up. So, I think you've got it exactly right. We feel good about octane and we feel good about the oxyfuels position. Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sirs. Next question is form Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. I think maybe just to wrap up, just one quick question is, you've highlighted a bunch of different outage-related items for next quarter. If we roll all those up, that works out about $125 million to $150 million. Is that right or did I miss something? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I'm going to be a little troubled doing the math. That sounds a little bit high. But I'm not sure if you're doing a relative-to-relative. What we've got in the fourth quarter is we have a continuation of the asset yields and the PO turnarounds. So, there was one month in the third quarter, one month in the fourth quarter. In Europe, in EAI, they're kind of a similar thing with the M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster cracker, where we have a one month in the third quarter, one month in the fourth quarter. So, we have similar... Unknown Speaker : Refinery... (59:10) Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Similar impact across those periods. Now, when we get into the first quarter is where we do have more activity, because in the first quarter we'll have a part of the refinery in turnaround. If you recall, we moved out of this spring due to the strike in the labor environment, moved it into the first quarter of next year. And, of course, Corpus Christi will be there. So, that'll be a fairly large activity. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Brian DiRubbio with Tipp Hill Capital. Your line is now open. Brian V. DiRubbio - Tipp Hill Capital Management LLC : Great. Thank you for letting me ask the question. Just want to clarify a comment that you made earlier. You said first half of 2016 will look like first half of 2015. So, that's just on the EBITDA level basis. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : No, I was thinking more about market conditions and relative supply-demand, the amount of industry planned outages, along those lines. Brian V. DiRubbio - Tipp Hill Capital Management LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Cooley May with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Cooley May - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning, guys. So, if I'm looking at the market correctly, it appears that following heavy planned outages kind of in the first half of next year, the supply of U.S. ethylene will grow 3% year-over-year next year, 9% in 2016 and 17% year-over-year in 2017. So, I want your thoughts just generally on capital deployment during this period. Do you expect to buy back a similar rate of stock or similar amount of stock over this period? And also, if you're looking to keep merchant ethylene as a similar portion to what is consumed, what high ROI projects do you envision? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, in terms of cash deployment, our approach so far has been to prioritize our high return growth projects CapEx. And what remains, we would dedicate to share repurchase. In the absence of significant M&A, that would be accretive. That \u2013 our approach will be similar in that regard. In terms of derivative projects, I think we're continuing to study a lot of different options in that area. I think we'll be a merchant seller in the future, a degree to which a merchant seller will depend on our opportunity in the derivative projects. So, that \u2013 as we develop those and we align with our board, we'll communicate with all of you on our progress. Cooley May - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Okay. Well, I think if there are no further questions, then thank you for all of your questions. And let me close with a few comments. We delivered another record quarter despite further declines in oil price and related volatility in end markets. I think this is a testament to the balance and resilience of our portfolio. Our continued focus on safe, reliable, cost-competitive operations, it defines who we are and enable our financial performance. We're a strong cash flow generator with the discipline and shareholder-friendly approach deploying our free cash flow. In the past 12 months, we have returned $6.3 billion to shareholders via repurchases and dividends. Our growth program continues to focus on low capital cost debottlenecks and end products that leverage our technology. We're increasing operational leverage where we see structural advantage, i.e., the U.S. So, our focus stays steadfast. I hope you see our approach is consistent while we remain constructive about the industry outlook for 2016. Thanks for your continued interest in our company. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you, all, for joining. You may now disconnect.",

(Broker) Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC Operator : Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin. Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Tori. Welcome to LyondellBasell's Fourth Quarter 2015 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO; Thomas Aebischer, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions. Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com. And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time today until 11 PM Eastern Time on March 2, by calling 866-465-1311 in the United States and 203-369-1427 outside of the United States. And the pass code for both numbers is 22160. During today's call we'll focus on fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance, the current environment and the near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the non-cash, lower of cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we've discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the fourth quarter, we recognized LCM charges totaling $284 million, and comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. With that being said, now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thanks Doug. Good morning, to all of you, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. For those of you that follow LyondellBasell you might recall that one year ago, in my first earnings call as the CEO of LyondellBasell, I had described how we built a company capable of delivering differential results for our shareholders in a variety of business climates. I'm pleased to report that we successfully navigated the volatility of 2015 to deliver another record year for you, our shareholders. Before we get into the numbers, I would like to introduce a new member of our team, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thomas Aebischer. Thomas comes to LyondellBasell with a long history of global accomplishments in the arenas of finance, information technology, accounting, tax, and procurement. I'm confident that Thomas will provide our finance and IT organizations with the experience and leadership to drive our continued success. Thomas, welcome to LyondellBasell. Thomas Aebischer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you very much both for your kind words and good morning to all of you. Although I have only been with LyondellBasell for a few weeks, I'm very impressed with the relentless commitment and focus for superior results that I have already seen in the company. I look forward to meeting all of you, our stakeholders and the investment community and describing how we will continue to build value with disciplined and consistent financial management. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thanks Thomas. Let's take a look at slide four and reflect on a few of the more notable financial accomplishments for 2015. Although we operate in a very capital intensive industry, LyondellBasell's record earnings in 2015 generated robust cash flow and a 34% return on our invested capital. $1.4 billion of this cash was used to fund our capital program, while over $6 billion was committed to dividends and share buybacks. Our dividend yield placed us in the top quintile of the S&P 500 index and the purchase of our outstanding shares relative to our average enterprise value placed us in the top 3% of the S&P 500. The strength of our earnings and our disciplined use of cash helped us to again outperform the S&P 500 on total shareholder return basis. Before we dive deeper into the financials, I would like to call your attention to slide number five. LyondellBasell culture places a strong emphasis on continuously improving our health, safety and environmental performance. I'm proud to report that our team again achieved record safety performance in 2015. This is top decile performance for our industry. We believe that outstanding safety performance is an essential foundation for reliable operations that deliver differential financial performance. While I'm pleased to see the improvement for the past year, we'll continue to be relentless in our drive for safety perfection. Our annual results summarized on slide number six, exceeded the previous records established during 2014, with $8.1 billion of EBITDA and $10.35 of earnings per share during 2015. As seen in the quarterly results on the bottom of the slide, LyondellBasell's strong operating performance during the second quarter and third quarters enabled us to capture the benefits of tight markets, due to industry outages. Relatively lower margins resulting from more balanced markets, seasonal trends and lower crude prices coupled with several planned and unplanned outages in our plants reduced the company's fourth quarter profitability. Slide seven, summarizes some 2015 accomplishments and segment results. Three of the five segments Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International, Intermediates and Derivatives and Technology achieved a record results, over $5.8 billion of cash flow from operations enabled us to buy back 52 million shares or 11% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Additionally, we increased our interim dividend by 11% to $0.78 per share bringing our total dividend for 2015 to $3.04 per share. I won't mention each of the operating accomplishments shown here, but I think these items exemplify our continued operating strength in advancing growth programs. Strong operations, advantaged feeds and incremental volumes reflect a common and consistent theme from how the entire team at LyondellBasell continually finds ways to realize more productivity from our existing assets. Let's turn to slide 8, and look at some of the metrics that drove 2015 performance. I'll highlight a few. Across the top of the page, we have plotted our key volumes. From the left, you can see the additional volume from our La Porte ethylene expansion, and the steady increase in polyethylene and polypropylene volumes largely from existing assets. In the charts, along the bottom of the page, you see a summary of product margins and spreads. The indexed ethylene and polyolefins charts represent our internal data, while the other two represent industry benchmarks. Falling U.S. ethylene margins were partially offset by rising polyethylene and polypropylene margins, helping to maintain strong chain profitability. In Europe, both Olefins and Polyolefins margins increased. MTBE and refining industry spreads remain relatively constant with prior years. Please turn to slide nine, which plots fourth quarter and full year segment results. As I already mentioned, this has been a record setting year for both EBITDA and operating income. I'll review these in detail during the segment discussions. Please turn to slide 10, which provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2015, we generated $5.8 billion of cash from operations. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $1 billion at a coupon rate of 4.625%. The cash and short-term securities balance ended the year at $2.4 billion. Turning to slide 11. You can see the $5.8 billion in cash from operations; this cash generation has allowed us great flexibility. Over the past four years we have funded $5.6 billion of capital investment and $18.7 billion towards dividends and share repurchases. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 142 million shares or about 25% of the total shares outstanding. At the end of 2015, we had approximately 15 million shares remaining under the existing share repurchase authorization. Since this is the beginning of a new year, I wanted to address some of your 2016 modeling questions. Regarding capital, we're currently planning to spend approximately $1.9 billion during 2016. This spending level progresses both our base maintenance and growth programs. Approximately 40% is targeted toward our growth program. Base maintenance spending increases this year due to a heavy turnaround schedule and increased health, safety and environmental spending. The majority of the growth spending will be dedicated to the Corpus Christi ethylene expansion that should begin production during the third quarter. Although not all plans are finalized, we expect capital spending to remain around $2 billion annually through 2020. The largest individual growth project is our PO/TBA plant, which is currently estimated to cost approximately $2.1 billion. While we have not yet finalized plans and timing for all of our polyethylene growth projects. We are currently performing design engineering for a 1 billion pound expansion that could be complete during the 2018 and 2019 timeframe. Our net cash interest expense for 2016 is expected to be approximately $320 million. This includes interest on $7.7 billion of outstanding bonds at an average coupon rate of approximately 5.2% and $12 million of interest on short-term facilities. At current conditions, we estimate that these expenses will be offset by approximately $100 million in benefits from interest rate and currency swaps and interest on our cash balance. 2016 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.1 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions that total of approximately $110 million, and we estimate a pension expense of approximately $65 million. We currently expect a 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 28%. The cash tax rate is expected to be somewhat lower. Now let's turn to slide 12, and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $834 million, $86 million less than third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $3.8 billion. Relative to the third quarter ethylene margin decreased by $0.06 per pound, this decline was driven by prices that were lower by $0.04 per pound and higher cost due to lower coal product prices. Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter averaging 95%. 72% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs. In Polyolefins our polyethylene spread was relatively unchanged, while the polypropylene spread was up approximately $0.04 per pound. Polyethylene volumes were relatively unchanged, polypropylene experienced sales volume decline of approximately 8% due to operating issues at our Bayport plant. For the full year results decreased by $369 million with higher Polyolefin results offsetting more than half of the decline in Olefins. Polyolefins results provided approximately $570 million of improvement over the prior year due to margin improvement and increased polyethylene volumes from our 2014 Matagorda debottleneck. Overall 2015 was a year of transition with lower crude prices moving margin from Olefins into Polyolefins. Industry operating rates for Olefins improved and our crackers operated reliably. We completed our Channelview expansion during the third quarter and captured the additional capacity from our 2014 La Porte olefins expansion and Matagorda polyethylene debottleneck. Our growth program for ethylene and polyethylene continues to add value. In January, spot ethylene prices have continued to decline as the market follows lower oil prices. We continue to see margins holding for polyethylene and additional upside for polypropylene margins in a very tight North American market. A heavy turnaround season is planned for U.S. crackers in 2016, with the schedule particularly heavy during the second quarter where IHS estimates that 10% of North American capacity will be offline. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion will begin during the second quarter with completion planned during the third quarter. Let's turn to slide 13, and review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and international segment. During the fourth quarter, underlying EBITDA was $451 million or $104 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, underlying EBITDA was a record of nearly $1.9 billion, a $445 million increase versus 2014. Olefin results decreased versus the third quarter by approximately $130 million due to lower margins. Polyolefin results improved and the sales volume increased by 6% and 5% for polyethylene, and polypropylene respectively. Polyethylene margin remained strong, but we're relatively unchanged, while polypropylene margins had a modest improvement. Our polypropylene compounding business improved modestly on higher sales volumes. Equity income decreased by $11 million due to reduced margins at our Saudi Arabian joint ventures. Olefin results for the full year increased by approximately $25 million over 2014. This increase is largely the result of a lower cost of naphtha that outpaced the declines in ethylene pricing. Excluding the impact of our M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster cracker turnaround, we operated our crackers in Europe at 95%. Our Polyolefins results increased approximately $420 million year-on-year reflecting improved spreads and higher volumes for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Polypropylene compounding and Polybutene-1 results were relatively unchanged versus 2014. Equity income from our joint ventures increased by $54 million due to strong margins at our joint ventures in Poland and South Korea. During January, industry conditions were generally consistent with the fourth quarter. During March, we'll start to turnaround on our Berre, France olefins cracker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $20 million. Joint venture equity earnings are anticipated to decline modestly in part due to lower Polyolefin prices and the Southeast feedstock price increases that took effect in late December. Now please turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $286 million, a decline of $220 million from the third quarter. For the full year, the segment generated record EBITDA of nearly $1.7 billion, $104 million more than 2014. The fourth quarter decline was attributable to typical seasonal demand declines combined with planned outages and uncharacteristically high unplanned outages in our plants. The segments fourth quarter results were impacted by planned maintenance totaling approximately $20 million and unplanned downtime impacted results by approximately $50 million. Propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased by approximately $10 million with slightly lower margins due to sales mix. In our Intermediate chemicals business, EBITDA declined by approximately $160 million as styrene margins declined by $0.07 per pound. Included in the Intermediate chemicals results, acetyls results declined by approximately $30 million due to lower volumes from an extended turnaround, and a $0.17 per gallon decrease in methanol pricing. Oxyfuels results were lower by approximately $60 million in line with typical, seasonal trends. During most of 2015, LyondellBasell's propylene oxide and derivatives and styrene business captured opportunities while the industry experienced operating problems that tightened the markets for those products. Intermediate chemical results improved by approximately $120 million due to improved styrene margins that were partially offset by lower methanol and vinyl acetate margins. Oxyfuels results decreased by approximately $60 million versus 2014, which benefited from unseasonably strong fourth quarter margins one year ago. The New Year has started with stable demand in the propylene oxide market. Oxyfuel margins remain near typical winter levels, methanol prices have come under pressure with additional capacity entering the market and lower crude oil prices. In contrast to the fourth quarter, we do not have any significant planned maintenance scheduled during the first quarter. Let's move to slide 15 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $68 million, a decline of $75 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $519 million of EBITDA, an increase of $110 million versus 2014. During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $18.55 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 206,000 barrels per day. Rates were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance. The total impact is estimated to be approximately $50 million, the lower Maya spread was primarily driven by seasonally weaker gasoline crack spreads. The cost of RINs increased by approximately $10 million related to the EPA ethanol requirements. 2015 full year Refining results improved over 2014, despite challenges from a labor strike in the first quarter and fourth quarter operating issues. Crude throughput averaged 238,000 barrels per day down 21,000 barrels per day from 2014. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $22 per barrel for the year. The refineries capture rate of this margin improved during 2015 with improved secondary product margins and higher utilization rates \u2013 higher utilization of discounted Canadian crude oil volumes. The cost of RINs were relatively unchanged. We're currently performing planned maintenance on a crude unit and a coker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $40 million. First quarter crude oil throughout is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2015. Turning to slide 16. Let's step back and consider the changes that are occurring in our core Olefins and Polyolefins markets. As crude prices have fallen over the past 15 months, there has been some compression in North America and monomer margins, but they remained quite good. This is illustrated by the grey bars it the chart on the top left. The chart in the upper right demonstrate that polyethylene and polypropylene demand growth improved in 2015, relative to the prior four years to approach the long-term growth averages we have seen over the past 25 years. This strong growth supports the balanced to tight conditions that are likely to persist into 2016. These healthy markets have resulted in the strong Polyolefin margins in both Europe and the U.S., as you can see from the blue bars on the left. Finally, the table on the lower right, highlights LyondellBasell's leverage to be strong integrated chain margins. Global supply and demand balances, regional feedstock advantages and industry operating rates continue to support our positive outlook for our industry and our business. Let me conclude with slide 17, the fourth quarter was a period, where the ethylene industry returned to a balanced market, as industry operating problems subsided. Polyolefin margins expansions offset much of the decline in monomer margins. At LyondellBasell planned maintenance activities across our assets negatively impacted our results by approximately $55 million, while unplanned events increased the negative impact by $105 million. The fourth quarter was also impacted by seasonal factors, primarily in our fuel related-products, which negatively impacted the core group by approximately $100 million. This is generally comparable to the seasonal impact over the last few years. During 2016, oil price volatility and concerns about the global economy will undoubtedly foster uncertainty in financial markets. Despite such uncertainty, we believe that we continue to benefit from abundant supplies of low priced feedstocks and from solid underlying demand for our products. Additionally, we anticipate that the heavy industry outage schedule for the first half of 2016 will continue to be constructive for the markets we serve. Before we open the line for your questions, I want to make you aware of our upcoming investor reception to be held here in Houston in conjunction with the IHS World Petrochemical Conference. As in the past, we will be hosting the reception with members of our executive leadership team at the end of the first day of the conference near the venue. Please watch your email for invitations or contact Doug for further details. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Stephen Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, thank you. You mentioned your ethylene operating rates at 95%. What would you estimate global cracker operating rates to be? And where do you think they could be over the next couple of quarters, in light of the pickup in turnarounds that you mentioned? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Stephen. Global operating rates, you know our sense is that they've been averaging in the high 80%s to about 90%, excluding some of the unplanned outages. So, last year in the second quarter they probably drifted a little lower. I think in 2016, markets are going to be relatively balanced. In 2015 demand growth for ethylene nearly matched supply growth for ethylene. So market conditions look very similar. I think the thing we're going to have watch is the level of unplanned outages that created the tight markets in second quarter. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And what feedbacks are you getting from your customers with respect to their inventory levels, as oil fell during the fourth quarter? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well if you think about it, throughout last year, as oil price declined and there was uncertainty about global economic growth, we saw our customers depleting inventory especially downstream of our polyolefins business. By the end of the year, our sense was, they were buying only what they needed and they were buying kind of one week at a time. So anecdotally, I would say that inventories are very low and we see even in the last week of January, when we saw oil prices move up a little bit, we had a certain sudden rush in terms of demand, both in Asia and in Europe. So my sense is inventory is very low. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to get a \u2013 I guess some thoughts on this demand situation. It looks like demand is flowing through slightly better on polyolefins. Is that \u2013 would you attribute any of that to inventory building ahead of this large turnaround schedule that's coming in North America? And then secondly, do you think that there is any kind of flow through from lower energy prices on demand? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yes, good morning, Arun. First of all, in terms of inventory build in polyolefins, we haven't really seen that. And typically, with turnarounds, my sense is that the industry doesn't tend to build polyolefin inventory, especially here in the U.S. where we're able to supplement ethylene production through purchases and so on. So, I think inventories are probably at average levels in our industry and I would say downstream they're on the low side. In terms of demand benefiting from lower energy, difficult to say. I think the more important theme is that in 2015, we saw very good strong growth in polyethylene and polypropylene globally, including in Europe where we saw demand growth. And I think this is a testament to the fact that both of those product areas and about two-thirds of our total output from the company goes into non-durable applications, which tend to grow generally irrespective of economic conditions. And so, again, I see next year 2016 being very similar, that demand growth and supply growth will likely match, and we'll have pretty balanced markets. And again, if there is inventory replenishment downstream then that should add to demand in 2016. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, and just as a follow-up, just want to get your thoughts on capacity growth in general, there is obviously a lot of crackers set to come online in 2017 through 2019. Do you see all of that coming through, and how does that affect your own decisions to expand polyethylene capacity? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : There are \u2013 I think there are something like eight crackers that are planned here in the U.S. between 2017 and 2020. As evidenced by prior start-ups, not all of those will start-up on time. Our sense is most of those will go; timing could vary based on what's been announced. Our approach has been, in the past, and will continue to be in the future, that we want to be largely integrated in the ethylene and derivative chain. But we do have some merchant \u2013 we do have a merchant position, I expect us to have one in the future. And as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, so far we're advancing a 1 billion pound expansion and we have a few others that we're working. So, those others, it will be more a matter of timing and phasing. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, it's Brian Maguire on for Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Hi, Brian. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I was hoping you could share your thoughts on any potential impacts on the lifting of the crude export ban in the U.S.? And I guess, particularly and refining operations, any expected impact from that? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Brian, I don't see much impact, in terms of crude supply. We've been diversifying our crude supply over the past three years or four years and we have a good mix of Canadian, Mexican and other sources. So, I don't expect much of an impact. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And one follow-up, I know, you mentioned couple times, how strong polypropylene margins have been recently. I guess, just kind of what are you seeing in January and how do you expect that to play out through the rest of 2016? Is it a case kind of like with polyethylene, where the polymer margin can \u2013 is tight enough that you can sustainably hold on to that? Or do you expect to have to pass some of the lower monomer through, as 2016 goes on? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, in the case of polypropylene, we see a very, very tight market, there is really not any new supply coming here in the U.S. So, I would expect that to continue. We've had years of fairly modest margins. And as you know, our company has significant leverage to polypropylene. We're the largest polypropylene producer in the world. And so we're very constructive about polypropylene. Polyethylene, I think is very balanced. We get these inventory cycles that come through, but again as I mentioned in the prior question, small increases in crude price have caused spurts of buying which tells me that, there is not a lot of inventory downstream. And I think, as we go into the seasonally strong period in March, April, May, we should see markets be very firm. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks very much. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Bob, on styrene, you've been positive, constructive for the last number of quarters, what's your view now on styrene heading into 2016, post the little bit weakness you saw in Q4? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : David, I'm still constructive, I mean, I think if you step back and look at supply \u2013 new supply, there isn't much that's coming. There is \u2013 anticipated restart or already restarted POSM unit in Europe that was down, there're some others that are down in Asia right now. But again styrene, a lot like polypropylene has gone through even more so I would say, styrene has gone through years of under investment and demand has finally caught up. And we see styrene market being much more balanced over the coming years. And we think, now that the shift in polystyrene demand has happened. Demand should grow reasonably well year-over-year. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And last Bob, there's been some M&A activity pick up this week, what's your view on M&A for Lyondell, maybe over the next two years, three years, four years? How will that play into your growth plans? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I think as I've mentioned David in prior calls, our priority thus far has been on share repurchase, and when we think about deploying our free cash flow. But as all good companies do, we study various different ideas, and we know the lane that we want to play in, we know our strengths, and so we continue to monitor the market. And we're always weighing share buyback versus other options. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Thank you. Bob, just I thought you might outline in more detail some of your derivative expansion plans in this call. Just wondering when can we expect more of an outline? And is it primarily polyethylene that you remain interested in, do you have that capacity to increase your polypropylene plants? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah. So far I've defined for you the 1 billion pound expansion that we're thinking we'd bring online in 2018 and 2019. We'll develop further plans as the year progresses. So you can imagine, I don't want to get out in front of my board in terms of the kind of growth plans that we envision. But if you just step back and think about our strategy and our approach, we aim to be largely integrated in ethylene and derivatives. And I think that will stay true as time goes on. In terms of polypropylene, we're actively studying debottleneck ideas, and we'll consider greenfield as well. Still early, we've seen this improvement in polypropylene very quickly in 2015. So, we'll be very thoughtful and methodical as we've been in the past, but to the extent possible debottlenecks have served us well in the past and that's an area, we'll explore in the future first. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And just on the polypropylene outlook, as you showed in the slide 16, polyethylene demands recover to its long term trend, polypropylene hasn't. Do you think that as propylene is come down to a more normal ratio relative to ethylene that you could still see further demand expansion in polypropylene? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Absolutely, I think, polypropylene demand will likely accelerate more as propylene is much more competitive, especially here in the U.S. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I'm surprised you thought that customers' inventories of polyethylene are low going into all this outage activity that we going to have in North America. Why do you think, they are not preparing for that? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I think, their sense is that the product is very available. That's usually been the trend. The only time John that I have seen customers build inventory is when we had a couple of bad hurricanes come through Houston, I think that spooked people. And so prior to hurricane season they build for a year or two. But generally they don't do that, we haven't seen that. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, I'd imagine by now you've repositioned your ethylene that gets displaced by the new oxy cracker. Could you just confirm that? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yes. We've been actively contracting ethylene, as you know, with our Corpus Christi startup in the third quarter. We're well ahead of our planning on all of that and we had a fairly, matured merchant portfolio in terms of customers for ethylene and so we were planning for that very well. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : You touched in your prepared remarks, you touched on a bit of a hit to your Saudi joint ventures. Now we all know obviously that the Saudi's escalated cost towards the end of the year, in terms of natural gas cost, ethane cost and the like. So what sort of \u2013 if we were to sort of freeze product pricing at current levels and oil prices and the like. What sort of a year-on-year hit should we expect from that feedback cost escalation in Saudi? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah, Hassan for us it's very modest. As you know, our joint venture, equity ownership is about 25% in the biggest ethane cracker investment over there for us. I would estimate that to be in the $10 million to $15 million range annually. So it's not significant, frankly. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Super. And as a follow up, on the acetyl side of things, bit of an interesting year last year, where you had like a series of industry outages in 2015, then you had initially higher methanol prices then a precipitous decline in methanol prices. So how should we be thinking about, the acetyl business on a year-over-year basis, particularly in light of \u2013 some of this capacity coming back on line and continue downward pressure on methanol prices? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well I think, in terms of methanol Hassan, certainly more capacity has come on line and you can see the impact of that. I think, it's going to be a more competitive market in 2016. In terms of further downstream into acetyls, we're going to have to watch how Asia demand develops and how well global capacity runs. But likely, a little bit more competitive market in 2016 than there was in 2015. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Super. Thanks so much Bob. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. Can we talk a bit about feedstocks, in particular ethane and propane, I'm just looking at natural gas, is at $1.99 and propane has become the preferred crack again. So, I guess two questions within this, one is how low do you think ethane is actually going to be able to go with the natural gas price and we passed the point where propane can't drag it lower either, and then I have a follow-up. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Sure. Well, first of all, we talked about this last time that as ethane price moves up and down, it doesn't track exactly with its cost floor day-to-day. But over time our sense is that there is \u2013 ethane is still very well supplied, and it should sell closer to its cost floor. The fact that propane is more in favor today in terms of economics, I think that will ebb and flow as we crack more propane then ethane could come back in and the key for us at the company is to focus on flexibility. And then, so I think we have a very flexible cracker fleet that can crack all the way up to naphtha still and then that's what we are aiming to do, Vincent is to make sure that we retain that flexibility and incrementally build on that. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, I guess that gets into my follow-up question, which is the new oil price stack and futures curve. Are you changing your thoughts on flexibility and what you want to be more flexible for, is that shifting away from ethane at all as we move into the latter half of the decade where there is going to be a lot more ethane demand and maybe not as much production? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I think \u2013 again I think flexibility is going to be the key and so we are investing incrementally to increase our flexibility to crack more propane, a few other feedstocks. And so, that's what we want to retain longer-term. It is difficult to call two years, three years from now whether it will be ethane or propane. We want to make sure that we can crack meaningful amounts of the big feedstocks. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, fellas. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Question just on the split between ethylene and ethylene derivatives. When we get through with the \u2013 your debottlenecks that are going on this spring for you and for others. It looks like ethylene capacity is going to increase, until you bring on your potential polyethylene. Should it be fair to think about things sliding for the ethylene side and moving more towards the derivatives over the back half of 2016 and 2017? Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : Well, Duffy this is Doug. We've long had a very solid merchant position with the key supplier base there. And obviously, as we increase the ethylene when we bring up the capacity at Corpus Christi, we'll add that probably in the third quarter you'll see that come into the market. That's contracted, but you'll see that as merchant sales. I think (44:45) remember its merchant sales, is where it's going to, so it's contracted merchant. Then, as we move down the road, what we'll do is we'll bring the polyethylene capacity up, and that will sort of rebalance across that. And as Bob said, he's looking at other polyethylene options, and other derivative options for it within the company. So, yeah, you will see our merchant position for a while step up in a contracted manner. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, just the lower oil price environment, how does that affect the economics of the PO/TBA plant you guys are contemplating in Texas? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah. I think, Duffy on that one, the key is first of all having a view on octane and we think octane is going to be very tight because a lot of the new engines are high compression engines, who require high octane. The other thing that's important to remember about PO/TBA is that the TBA benefits from butane selling below oil price. So, we see butane discounts relative to oil sustaining at the kind of levels that they've been \u2013 50%, 60%. If you think about the gas barrel, or associated gas that gets developed, wet gas will be preferred because it has co-products that have good economics. So, we think that still looks solid, and remember the startup on that is mid-2020 or early 2020. So likely by then, I would think oil prices are higher than where we are today. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Terrific. Thank you, guys. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. If I remember correctly, you were initially thinking about 1 billion to 2 billion pounds expansion for your polyethylene plant, and it seems like you have decided on the low end of this range. Could you just give us some thoughts on why? Why did you come down at a 1 billion versus 2 billion? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah. I think, Aleksey, this is really more about phasing. So we're advancing the first project in a more focused way, and then as the year progresses, we'll be in a position to talk a little bit more about the phasing of the next project. So, it's not an absolute, this one is the only one we'll do. We have several ideas; I just want to make sure that we do them in a paced kind of phased manner. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And as a follow up, in the medium-term, it appears that your cash flow does not support both dividend and the share buybacks at the current pace; you would need to keep borrowing incrementally to sustain this pace of buybacks. Is your medium-term plan to keep doing that, to increase the leverage, or perhaps the level of buybacks could be impacted? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, if think about our cadence, what we have done up to this point is we've been on this pace of 10% share buyback. I think you should expect that we're going to be relatively consistent with that. We'll be issuing our proxy in early March and so you can read the detail there. But given where share price is today, given what our earnings outlook is, I think we should be able to support a reasonable share buyback program. We've shown in the past that we've been willing to take on incrementally a bit more debt to support the share buyback program. I think we're prepared to do that; if you look at our leverage we're quite low. So, we'll continue to evaluate that as the year goes, but I would expect that our pace in the past is what should occur in the future. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey good morning, gentlemen. Hey Bob, you outlined a \u2013 coming back on polyethylene, you outlined a case that you're not really seeing margin compression here in January relative to Q4. And your expectation is you're going to see demand improve seasonally and there is a lot of industry turnaround. So, I'm guessing you're thinking things are going to stay relatively stable through the middle of the year. And then, when things start to pick back up, operations start to pick back up, what do you say to investors that might be expecting to see some more margin compression in the back half of this year? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah good morning Frank. Absolutely, in the first half of the year we think that markets are going to be fairly tight. In the back half of the year, we are going to have to see how demand develops in China, here in the U.S. and there is certainly new capacity coming online. So I think, that it will probably more of a balanced market in the second half, as opposed to the first half that has the potential to be a very tight market. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And staying with that demand theme globally, obviously you will see how China develops. How are you thinking about that region right now and for that matter, how are you thinking about European demand as well. Obviously the stock market is telling us one thing; what are you seeing on the ground? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : In terms of polyethylene demand? Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sure, yes. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah, well I think demand is still \u2013 is developing quite nicely. Again as I mentioned earlier in one of the questions, we're seeing buying activity pick up as we move towards the second half of January. And I would expect that this year we ought to see similar growth to last year. And frankly, if I'm right about lower inventories downstream, the higher \u2013 as the oil price incrementally stabilizes or moves up, we should see inventory replenishment downstream, which will add to demand growth year-over-year. So frankly, I'm pretty constructive about polyethylene growth here going into 2016. Frank, downstream, our customers don't have a lot of inventory globally. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's very helpful. Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thanks very much. There's been an enormous curtailment of oil drilling in the United States, and presumably that curtailment will continue. Do you think that that will affect ethane supply over the next couple of years? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Jeff, so far we don't see an impact. It's certainly something we watch, and if we look at what industry consultants have been talking about and our own intel, our sense is that ethane should be very well supplied. There is enough ethane to supply the expansions that are upcoming. Our sense also is that, if you think about gas drilling, likely the wet barrels could develop first because ethane and propane and butane incrementally provide value to the economics of gas. So, we're pretty constructive and again for us, we continue to focus on our ability to also crack more propane and butane and so on. And I think the industry will swing from ethane to propane and propane becomes more favored and that'll naturally balance the three NGLs, I think. So, more and more we need to consider the NGL pool as a total rather than the individuals, I think. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, for my follow-up, you talked about stability in polyethylene margins. And I mean, no one exactly knows where polyethylene prices are going to go, but isn't that sort of the general drift of things, that maybe in the next couple of months they'll come off, I don't know, a nickel a pound, something like that? So, do you have a different view, or do you think that your margin compression in polyethylene will come in the second quarter? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : I think, you said it well Jeff, it is difficult to predict the price where it's going to go. But, one thing that I think about is the balance between supply and demand, whether it's regionally or globally and my sense is that we still have fairly balanced markets. While coming into a March, April, May timeframe, it will bring a seasonal uptick in demand, likely inventory restocking. I would imagine at some point oil price will reach some kind of a bottom and if that happens it will bring buyers back. We've had \u2013 if you think about 2015, we had a year where not only there was lack of confidence on oil price, but also there were questions about economic growth in the U.S., and in China, and we are destocking, despite that polyethylene demand grew more than 4%. So that's what makes me constructive. In the near-term, I don't where polyethylene prices are going to go, but I think markets are pretty balanced. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Hi. Good morning. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Bob, if the first wave of crackers start up in the U.S., at least four or five crackers, and if we need to get Marcellus ethane down to \u2013 of course to feed those crackers, do you see a port pressure on ethane if it has to be brought in from Marcellus? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah, I think if it has to be then certainly there is a tariff that they have to pay to get the ethane down. But I would say that as the first wave of crackers come online, there are closer supplies of ethane that will come to market. If ethane price were to rise enough for propane and butane to become much more economic, I think you'll see those who can shift to those other feedstocks, we'll do it. So \u2013 so that will all bring things in balance. And our sense is that the industry is still rejecting somewhere 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of ethane. And albeit some of that is up further away, but there's certainly enough nearby that I don't see ethane price rising dramatically above its fuel value. But it's something we'll continue to monitor of course. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. And you have a great balance sheet today, and given that if we do get into a cyclical downturn, how do you think your capital allocation strategy could change, and how can LyondellBasell take advantage of that situation? Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, in past investor meetings that we've had and when we did Investor Day last year, we showed you our cash deployment hierarchy. And I would say we're still very consistent with what we've shown you. Our first and highest priority is to making our assets very well. So we're going to spend money on maintenance capital and health, safety and environmental capital. We'll pay our dividends, we'll service our debt, and \u2013 when you think about our dividend, it's about 30% of our EPS. So, there are a lot of capacity certainly in our balance sheet as you rightfully mentioned, is very flexible. So, I thing we want to maintain this kind of strength and flexibility as we work through the back part of this decade and I think we'll find opportunities based on these strengths. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you speakers. Our next question is from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Your line is now open. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Yes. good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. What is your view on the ethylene price in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world? It seems significantly lower than Asia, certainly, and Europe. Is it going to sustain itself at this discount, or do you think that there's any sort of arbitrage opportunity? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Good morning, Nils. Well, first of all, when you think about the ethylene price, let's go back to Q4 and think about what developed during Q4. Production of ethylene in the U.S. was at a record level in Q4, where we had the highest production. At a time, when we also had a largely merchant supplier of ethylene had logistic issues where they had to move ethylene out of a cavern because they were going to do some maintenance on it. Also we had a very weak PVC market. So I think all of those things led to a decline in ethylene price in Q4 and that's kind of where we are today. As we work through Q1 and Q2 and we've talked about some of these large unplanned \u2013 sorry planned outages that are in Q2 that will likely tighten the market. I would expect PVC to improve. This specific logistics issue I described, and I think that will run its course by the end of Q1. So we'll have to see, but it seems to me that ethylene price ought to drift somewhat higher and the forward curve indicates that for ethylene. The other thing that's important here in the U.S. is to also look at polyethylene price, and look at polyethylene price in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world. And I think that starts to make a lot more sense. So, our ethylene is priced more locally and polyethylene is priced globally. And it's important to remember that distinction as we move through the year. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. Understood. Now, certainly, polypropylene has seeing a significant jump in its margin through 2015, it seems like 2016 even in January, there was some margin expansion there too. Is there to \u2013 it's a kind of a two part question. At what point, will this encourage additional investment in the U.S., you think to build more capacity? And then, is there a chance that polypropylene is getting to expenses relative to say high-density polyethylene and it might encourage some inter-polymer substitution. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Well, I think in terms of expansion, first of all you have remember that from the time somebody decides they're going to expand it to takes two to three years to that polypropylene capacity. So, I think meaningful expansions as we sit here today likely not until back half of the 2018 and maybe 2019, something like that, if someone were to decide today. In the near-term, polypropylene expansions have to come in concert with some thought about the source of propylene, and as we have more flexible crackers and propylene output varies, those who are going to expand have to take a view on where propylene prices are going and where the supply is going to come from. So, my sense is that this year, people will probably take a look at that and see where we go. In the near-term, I don't think higher polypropylene prices will impact demand or substitution from polyethylene, we've seen these periods in the past. I think polypropylene is very competitively priced. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. Thanks very much. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : All right. Thanks, guys. Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay. I think we're about out of time. So, I think we'll have one more question, please. I apologize to anyone that we haven't been able to take their questions. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our last question is next from Alexander Laurence with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Just a quick one. As you look at the cadence of investment over the next four or five years, to what extent is that being regulated by engineering bandwidth? And is there a need to sort of improve the bandwidth or increase engineering capabilities into the next cycle? So, can you just give us a little bit of longer-term context on that? Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : Yeah. I think certainly, that has been the most challenging part of this construction cycle is the frontend engineering and so the industry or the EPC companies have added some of that capability. And if you think about our projects like the PO/TBA project and our polyethylene project, those are kind of on the backend of construction of the big crackers and so on. So I think those projects will benefit from some slackening in demand, but not only engineering capability, but also for construction and commissioning and so on. So, I think, we're well placed and if you think about future cycles, the industry has certainly added capacity to be able to execute projects. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board : All right. Well thank you for all your thoughtful questions as always. Let me close with a few comments. First of all 2015 was a very challenging year, we had significant oil price decline, feedstock price volatility and uncertain outlook for global economic growth. Despite all of these headwinds, our portfolio continues to prove its resiliency and we delivered record results. I think our focus on safety, operational reliability and cost efficiency continue to serve us very well and position us to outperform in a verity of market conditions. This focus has enabled robust free cash flow generation, which has been deployed in a very shareholder-friendly way through low cost, high value growth projects, strong regular dividend, and large stock buybacks. Going forward, our focus and priorities remain very consistent. Thanks for your continued interest in our company. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin. Doug Pike : Thank you, Michelle. Well, hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's First Quarter 2016 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO; Thomas Aebischer, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.

And the pass code for both numbers is 42216. During today's call, we'll focus on first quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the non-cash, lower of cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we've discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And during the first quarter, we recognized LCM charges totaling $68 million, any comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. With that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thanks, Doug. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share improved relative with fourth quarter to $2.48 per share with EBITDA of $1.9 billion. This excludes the $68 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment. The sale of our Argentine subsidiary Petroken resulted in a gain of $78 million, which impacted earnings by $0.18 per share. We continued to deliver with three of our five operating segments improving in profitability relative to the fourth quarter. During the quarter, our downstream integration in polyolefins and other derivatives enabled us to capture profitability as margin moved from monomer into polymers and other downstream products. Our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well across most sides and we completed a planned maintenance turnaround in our refinery. After the close of the quarter, we completed our second Indian polypropylene compounding acquisition. We continued to execute on our financial priorities during the first quarter and Thomas will provide you, with an update on this progress in a few moments. Slide 5 reflects the outstanding safety performance that our employees and contractors achieved during the first quarter of this year, by reducing injuries to almost, the already low rates of the past several years. We strongly believe than an unrelenting focus on safety provides benefits to our operations and ultimately profitability. Good operating reliability across our chemical faculties supports this belief. And now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the first quarter. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, Bob and good morning. On Slide 6, we outline our quarterly and trailing 12 months segment result. As Bob mentioned, three of our five business segments improved relative to their fourth quarter 2015 performance. In olefins and polyolefins Americas results were similar to the fourth quarter. Olefins and polyolefins, EAI benefit from falling after prices and continued strength in polymers. Intermediates and derivatives benefit from a strong global styrene market and improved production following fourth quarter maintenance work. The refineries for low seasonal margins and reduced volumes largely due to a planned turnaround. Overall, despite the substantial fall in the price of crude oil and global economic uncertainties. Our profitability has remained strong with $7.9 billion in EBITDA over the past 12 months. Please turn to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the first quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized the similar amount in dividends and share repurchases. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates to borrow \u20ac750 million at a coupon rate of 1.875%. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to $527 million, during the first quarter. With the majority of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and turnarounds at the refinery and our Berre, France facility. During the first quarter, we increased our cash and liquid investment by $577 million to end with a balance of nearly $3 billion. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.7 billion of cash from operations and again used a nearly equal amount for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program, our borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investment balance inclined by approximately $600 million. Slide 8 provides a longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchased shares. Additionally, it has allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB plus, EAA 1 credit rating. We finished the quarter with approximately $5 billion of liquidity and the total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.2. Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 12.3 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased approximately 155 million shares or approximately 27% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3 million shares remaining on the existing authorization. In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early March. We proposed that our shareholders vote to authorize an additional repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares. During February, we received gross profits of $184 million from the sale of Petroken, our wholly owned subsidiary in Argentina. The Petroken polypropylene sale provided an after-tax gain of $78 million, $57 million is booked to the O&P Americas segment, while $21 million is related to the PP compounding business and booked to O&P EAI. The gain represents an $0.18 per share impact from our first quarter earnings. Before, I wrap up. I want to point out a few other items that may help you modeling of our company. First, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, slightly higher than our annual estimates. The first quarter was impacted by discrete [ph] tax events and our estimate for the full year remains unchanged at 28%. Depreciation amortization and interest expenses are currently running at rates in-line with our previous annual estimate. With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob. Bob Patel : Thanks, Thomas. Let turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, by discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our olefins and polyolefins, Americas segment. First quarter EBITDA was $878 million, a $44 million improvement over the fourth quarter. This includes a $57 million gain from the sale of Petroken. Relative to the previous quarter, olefins results were relatively unchanged. Ethylene prices declined by approximately $0.005 per pound and our margin slightly declined as we incurred and estimated $20 million negative impact related to ethylene purchases in preparation for our Corpus Christi plan turnaround. Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter. Averaging 94%, with similar high rates seen across the North American industry. 69% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 88% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $20 million. Results were driven by lower polyolefins spreads of approximately $0.04 per pound, with price declines partially offset by lower ethylene cost. Declines in polyethylene were partially offset by improved polypropylene results, which spread the expanding by approximately $0.06 per pound over the fourth quarter. Polypropylene volumes were relatively unchanged with improved US volumes offset by the absence of Petroken volumes from also the first quarter. During April, spot ethylene prices have improved over first quarter averages, as supply has tightened during a heavy industry turnaround season. The quarter is benefitting from a $0.05 per pound March, polyethylene price increase. Polypropylene prices may decline by few cents during the quarter, but demand and margins remain strong. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion began last week with completion plan during the third quarter. We currently estimate this to impact second quarter results by approximately $10 million and third quarter by approximately $40 million. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the olefins and polyolefins, Europe, Asia and international segment. During the first quarter, underlying EBITDA was $549 million or $98 million higher than the fourth quarter. These results include a $21 million gain from the Petroken sale. Olefins results improved by approximately $65 million with reduced cost for naphtha and other fees, outpacing a decline in ethylene prices. Our ethylene production volume was relatively unchanged as both periods included the impact of a planned turnaround. Utilization of an advantaged feedstocks increased by 7% of ethylene production to provide a $15 million advantage over naphtha during the quarter. Operating rates for the ethylene industry during the first quarter had been reported at 91%, a level that has not been seen in Europe since the first quarter of 2008. In polyolefins, improved results were driven by higher margins. European polyethylene spreads increased by approximately $0.01 per pound, while polypropylene spreads improved by approximately $0.02 per pound. Our polypropylene compounding and equity income was relatively unchanged. During April, global markets continued to tighten on strong demand with occasional reports of olefins and polyolefins shortages across various geographies and end uses. Next week, we anticipate completion of our Berre turnaround. Now please turn to Slide 11 for discussion intermediates and derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $354 million, an improvement of $68 million from the fourth quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives and oxyfuels were relatively unchanged. The improvement in I&D was largely driven by higher volumes and margins in the intermediate chemicals business. Styrene margins improved by approximately $0.02 per pound versus the fourth quarter. Our asset yields, C4 chemicals and the ethylene oxide and derivatives businesses all benefited from volume improvements relative to the fourth quarter, when we performed maintenance. Oxyfuels were relatively unchanged as low seasonal margins were offset by volume improvements. April has exhibited continued tightness for styrene that has supported strong pricing. Oxyfuel margins have started to rebound from winter levels. And methanol prices continued to be pressured by additional capacity entering the market, with some offset from higher crude oil prices. Let's move to Slide 12 for discussion of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $14 million, a decline of $54 million from the prior quarter. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined by $0.69 per barrel to average $17.86 for the quarter and crude throughput averaged 186,000 barrels per day. Rates were impacted by our planned turnaround and some unplanned maintenance. The cost of the RINs was relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. And you may be aware, a fire occurred in one of our two corporate processing units at the refinery on April 8. While we have not yet completed the investigation to determine the cause and full impact of the incident. We have continued to operate the refinery during the two weeks, following the fire and we expect to operate, at approximately 75% of full throughput during the second quarter. At the current time, we expect that repairs to return the refinery to full processing capability can be completed before the end of the second quarter. At current market conditions and repair expectations. We estimate a $40 million to $70 million second quarter impact. Our technology segment continued to perform well, with an $18 million improvement to $73 million of EBITDA during the first quarter. Turning back to the O&P segments, Slide 13 describes how our integrated positions in the ethylene chain help provide consistent profitability. The left chart illustrates the balance of ethylene production and consumption among products in the US and relative to our wholly owned and joint venture share globally. In the US, typically less than 20% of our sales are into the merchant markets. In addition to our polyethylene integration. Approximately one quarter of our US ethylene production is consumed internally in products and processes including ethylene oxide, styrene, vinyl acetate and metathesis. On a global basis, our ethylene positions relatively balanced. The right chart illustrates, how polyethylene is partially offsetting moderation of regional ethylene margins and improving our capture of the full obtained margins established by global price of polymers. Turning to Slide 14, this slide provides a similar view of the propylene chain. In the US, our propylene oxide business consumes approximately one-third of our propylene production. Although, we're short of propylene both in the US and globally. We're comfortable with our strong, long-term supply arrangement in all regions. With the addition of new on purpose propylene production from PDH and MTO technology around the world. We believe, that the world will be well supplied for the foreseeable future. In expansion of polypropylene margins illustrated by the prices and spreads on the right chart, has leveraged our leading global position in the propylene market. And with lower propylene pricing, the lower absolute price of polypropylene has driven strong demand growth globally. Slide 15 illustrates the impact of new capacity and new technologies on the global ethylene market. As we've discussed before, we believe that global demand growth in ethylene chain will continue to support effective operating rates between 90% and 93%. This is the zone, that we have operated in since late 2014 and where the market will typically behave in a balanced type manner, depending on maintenance schedules and operational reliability. While the upcoming capacity additions may create periods of disruptions in local markets. The global market should be able to absorb these additions, reasonably quickly. In the first quarter of 2016, the industry appeared to shift from a balanced market toward the high-end of this transitioning zone. We estimate that, first quarter industry effective operating rates were 95% in the US, 91% in Europe and about 90% in Asia. Today, global conditions are quite tight. The chart on the right, describes why we believe that new and rapid additions of methanol to olefins based ethylene capacity in China, is beginning to play a role in establishing a high cost floor for global ethylene chain pricing. While naphtha and LPG economics drive the majority of global ethylene supply. The last incremental global supply is increasingly filled by production from new China MTO price. Early in the first quarter, ethylene price was supported by this high cost floor and as we entered the spring demand and turnaround season, global supply demand tightened and March prices reflect the transition from a balance to tight global market that is approximately $0.15 per pound above this high cost floor. With approximately $0.25 per pound lower cost than MTO. US ethane-based production should continue to benefit from strong operating rates. Let me conclude with Slide 16. The first quarter developed, as we anticipated. We continued to see strong and growing demand for our polyolefin products in all regions. This supported full chain margins for our O&P business. Our I&D segment benefitted from higher volumes after completion of fourth quarter maintenance and strengthening styrene margins. Refining results were impacted by the turnaround and seasonally lower industry spreads. We're actively managing our portfolio, with a successful European bond placement. The completion of our Argentine divestiture, our second polypropylene compounding acquisition in India and continuation of the share repurchase program. Looking forward, we see olefins and polyolefins markets remaining tight during the near-term. There are heavy turnaround schedules in both the US and Asia. The recent rise in crude oil prices provides tailwinds for both pricing and demand, as customers no longer feel incentives to delay purchases, in hopes of future declines in product prices. In field markets, we're realizing typical seasonal spread improvements that support both our oxyfuels and refining businesses. Planned maintenance at our facilities is expected to impact second quarter results by approximately $20 million to $30 million and the refinery repair will impact results by an additional $40 million to $70 million. The supply and inventories of natural gas and NGL feedstocks remain strong and we expect pricing to remain favorable for the foreseeable future. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne of Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : I'm curious to your view on whether you think the European polyethylene price premium over the US is sustainable longer term and the opposite on polypropylene pricing, with the premium in the US, is that sustainable longer term? And then secondly, as the US polyethylene industry shifts to a more export-oriented market down the road, here in the next few years. Where do you anticipate your incremental exports are going to go? Can you move them into Europe? Bob Patel : Good morning, Steve. First of all, on the European markets and even your question about US. So I think you got to step back and look at operating rates globally. I think, we're in a regime where operating rates are balanced, in that balanced zone to tight zone. In Europe, PE prices have held up well. We think operating rates are relatively high. We're moving into a seasonally strong period. So I suspect that, generally polyolefin prices will be pretty resilient in Europe, for the foreseeable future, going into Q3. In the case of USPP prices, a very large gap had developed between Asia and the US. And we had anticipated that some of that gap would need to be narrowed. Now part of that's happened with Asian polypropylene prices moving up in Q1 and part of that has been with PP price declining some in the US. I think, those things are coming back in the balance. But if you step back, we'll likely land in a zone, where margins are very good from a historical perspective. And I suspect that, given where operating rates are. We should be able to sustain that or for some period of time, you know. In terms of your last question, about exports. Our marginal export from the US, should go to Asia, that's really the destination. To the extent, that we produce products in the US. And we could supplement our production in Europe. We might consider doing that, but we have a big base in Europe already. So we're really well positioned I think to optimize globally. We have a great marketing position in Asia. We have a big presence in Europe and so our shift is really moving more to global optimization in polyolefins, as this new capacity comes on. I think, we're well positioned to capture value in that regard. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan Chase. Jeff Zekauskas : In your refinery operation, in the quarter you just reported. Did maintenance activity lower EBITDA by $40 million or what's the different number? Bob Patel : Well, we didn't really quote a number around the maintenance. And I'll look to Doug in minute, but our refining segment results reflected a few things. We came into the year, as an industry here in the US, with pretty high inventories of gasoline. Diesel demand has been struggling, so we saw margins come in. I mentioned the crack spread declined some, one premiums had come in as well. And then in addition to that, we had our crude unit and coker turnaround which took some capacity out during the period. So it was a combination of both. Doug Pike : Yes, Jeff I think you're in the right, ballpark and the guidance that we gave before and you see it in the volumes being down, so that's where you see that predominantly. But also, what you found in the first quarter versus fourth quarter was there was a Maya 2-1-1 declined a little bit. So you saw some impact from that and naturally, when you're in a turnaround period, your mix and yields tend to be affected. So there's some impact of that, in that quarter. So it's a combination of those things. Jeff Zekauskas : Sure. And for my follow-up, what's your tentative date for when you'll be fully up and running after your $800 million pound expansion? Bob Patel : We're expecting the latter half of the year of Q3. Jeff Zekauskas : The latter half of Q3. Okay, good. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Roberts of UBS. Your line is now open. John Roberts : I think you originally expected $162 million in proceeds from the Argentine sale, did it come in at that level? Bob Patel : Yes, generally we came in at the level we had expected. John Roberts : Okay. Bob Patel : $180 million cash for the proceeds. John Roberts : Okay, thank you. And then, is polyethylene from recycled material globally larger or smaller than MTO? And kind of where does it sit on the cost curve? I'm thinking that's also been one of the swing factors out there recently in balancing polyethylene markets. Bob Patel : It has some, but we think that as we move into the next couple of years. MTO will really be the bigger picture because if you look at Asian capacity expansions on ethylene. I think about half of them are MTO, CTO type of capacity. So more and more I think that last increment will become more of the price setter as we go forward. John Roberts : Because you don't think recycled has been a major factor in helping to tighten the market here because it would be high cost as oil came down. Bob Patel : Yes, I think it has been a factor. I think it's been a factor, but it's a combination of that and the need for MTO for new sort of virgin polyethylene, if you will. That's created demand for the virgin polyethylene. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is now open. David Begleiter : Bob, just on polypropylene. It should also be, I guess a good Q2, but what's your expectation for polypropylene margins in the back half of the year versus maybe the first half of the year? Bob Patel : I think, we're still going to see a pretty balanced type market for some time and there's not really a lot of investment in the Q. And albeit, polymer plants don't take as long, as crackers do to build, it still takes some time to do engineering and get permits and so on. So our expectation is that, the polypropylene market globally should do reasonably well and certainly in the US, operating rates will be fairly high through this year and into next year. David Begleiter : Very good. And just lastly on styrene, Bob. Do you expect these strong conditions continue through the remainder of 2016? Bob Patel : Yes, I think so. I think styrene has been very resilient. Demand is growing, much like polypropylene. It's been under invested for so many years and we're seeing demand growth in the case of styrene in the last couple of years at reasonable levels. So, we think we're again in that operating rate zone. Where any outages would cause margins to stay relatively strong. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And now the next question comes from the line of Mr. Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Vincent Andrews : Obviously, we all know it is a big turnaround season, underway. But one of things that's changed over the past months or so, is that. The sort of length of the season appears to have extended as a couple of cracker turnarounds have been pushed out, later into the year. I'm just wondering, what impact do you think that will have in terms of how the market, how and when the market will reset itself, close to turnaround season in terms of, it seems like there'll probably be some pretty good pricing into the season. And there's a lot of concern about what happens to price thereafter. So, any thoughts on that would be helpful? Bob Patel : So if you look at April - May timeframe between - planned our outages are around the 10% range. But I think the shift of that, one cracker turnaround into the fall creates a tighter environment in the fall as well. Now so, our view is that, that with these planned outages being at a higher level now in the fall as well. We see a pretty tight market through Q3 and so far, we see pretty good demand growth, not only in the US, but globally. So, we expect pretty good market conditions through Q3 certainly. Vincent Andrews : Okay and just as a follow-up, Sasol recently announced delay in the start-up of their Gulf Coast cracker and it appears there are some subtext from that, was that in the low oil price environment, there's some funding issues. As you look around the world to some of the other planned capacity over the coming years, do you think it's plausible that we'll see delays for funding reasons as well? Bob Patel : Well, I think the delays could come from, not only funding but just general project delays from executions as well. I think, Vincent that this, so called second wave of cracker certainly would need to be evaluated and to what degree globally the MTO capacity will come on and. We have in our materials, the operating rates for ethylene and you see based on the current planned production increases in 18, there's a slight dip in operating rates and certainly, some of the delays occurred, it could see a much flatter operating rate curve in that balanced zone. And I think there's a possibility of that, that's an outcome of this lower oil price environment. And we've talked about this in other venues, in other in IR sort of meetings that in a lower oil price environment Greenfield cracker investments looked to high single-digit kind of returns. So I think it's feasible that some of this could get pushed out. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan : I guess I had a question, maybe can you describe the inventory environment out there. Do you think, your customers have built inventory in Q4 and Q1 as well, ahead of the turnaround season? Bob Patel : I think the inventories are at normal level. I don't think they're overly excessive downstream because while there was turnaround season anticipated, oil prices were also dropping. So that caused people not to build too much because maybe there was some expectation, of prices coming down and polyethylene prices did decline earlier in the first quarter and then they moved up recently. So, I don't see Arun. I don't see inventory is being theme here. The bigger theme is, is improving seasonal demand which we typically see in this April - May timeframe not only in US, but globally. And fairly heavy turnaround season here in the US and in Asia. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, thank you. And then maybe you can just describe, your views on the refining segment. Would you still characterize that as core or and something you'd invest in or is it harvest mode [ph], what are your plans are there, thanks? Bob Patel : It's a refinery there, that you know it's very complex, large scale refinery. It's here in Houston in very prime real estate. We like it, we like the asset and it generates good cash flow that we can deploy elsewhere. I don't think it's a segment where we would aim to grow, but certainly we view it as an important part of the cash generation capability of our company and deploying that cash, elsewhere in other segment that we see as being more strategic perhaps. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov : Back to MTO question, what percent of global demand do you think is supplied by non-integrated MTO? So merchants methanol buyers and also, what are the operating rates for those MTO units currently? Bob Patel : The amount is maybe in the 2% to 3% range. It's not a lot, but it's enough and is needed today to meet that last increment of demand and as I mentioned earlier. If you look forward and you look at the amount of expansion that are planned in Asia, quite a bit of the new capacity is going to be based on MTO and CTO. So I think it's important to think about that becoming a more meaningful slice of demand that will be price setter. And then in terms of operating rates, that's more difficult question to really asses because it's need based right. So, we do know that today MTO is needed and that's really to the extent that I can answer that question. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. And as a follow-up, turning to asset yields and VAM specifically. Two of your competitors announced plans or at least consideration for VAM expansion in North America. Have you looked into this and have you made a conclusion whether this is, all of interest to you or not? Bob Patel : Well, we're basic in methanol. VAM, we see as another ethylene derivative. So just kind of bit a high level and we would evaluate VAM, like we would any other ethylene derivative. So, you know that's how we think about it. It's one of our ethylene derivatives. Aleksey Yefremov : No current plans or evaluation of? Bob Patel : No, nothing that we've announced, no. Aleksey Yefremov : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. Don Carson : Bob, I want to go to Slide 15. You outlined your views of global ethylene supply and demand. Can you talk a bit about your outlook for feedstocks in the US specifically ethane availability and do you see propane perhaps you know capping, how high ethane can get on the basis of increased demand from these new crackers? Bob Patel : Yes, I mean I think certainly that interplayed between ethane, propane and butane as important. and as we come into the summer months, propane and butane tend to price lower and are more abundant here in the US. But let me talk a little bit about ethane and we know, this is a topic that's on a lot of people's mind. If you think about different time horizons. Think about the very near term. We still think, there's a significant amount of rejection that's occurring in the US and some of that nearby the Gulf Coast in some of the shale play like the Eagle Ford and the Permian and so on. So we think in the near-term, there's plenty of ethane available and certainly during this turnaround season. There's a little bit less ethane demand. As we go into the second half of the year in Q3, there's still quite a bit few turnarounds. So I think between that and propane and butane becoming more competitive in the cracker feed slate in the summer month, ethane should do quite well. Longer term, I can't help to think that with all of the reduction in E&P CapEx that eventually, this should be a price response, in oil. And we've seen a bit of that already with fairly big move in oil price recently. And as the oil price moves higher presumably that makes propane and butane more valuable. And likely I think wet gas more desirable to develop. And so we think that, that the crude to gas ratio should be favorable. We think, that wet gas ought to be more desirable to produce and that in the end, that ethane demand increase overtime will be met with more supply and we've seen that in the past, where the midstream space is able to respond pretty quickly. The infrastructure to the west is still fairly scalable. New fractionation capacity can be added very quickly. The capital cycle is far, far less than that for crackers. So in the end, I mean I think if I stand back, I think about there's a plenty of hydrocarbon here and ethane available. It's a matter of degree of advantage and I do think that, Greenfield investment will need to be undertaken more carefully in a $60, $65 oil environment compared to the $100 plus kind of oil environment. So that's how I see ethane, you know short, medium and longer term. Don Carson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar: I just wanted to ask you another question on this ethane, propane. And it's, as you see the new cracker start-up and also you have this ethane exports. And at what point in time at what price, you think the ethane export has become unviable and how do you see, exports playing a role in ethane pricing? Bob Patel : Yes, I think some of the ethane exports are needed for just feedstocks. I don't - I think they're going to be independent of price and some are more sensitive to price. And the thing you have to look is propane based, ethylene economics in Europe, compared to landed ethane from the US and what economics that would infer about ethylene in Europe. So some of that could change, but again more importantly I think P.J. there will be a reasonable supply response, if ethane prices were to rise and I think fundamentally there's plenty of ethane available and the ability - for ethane to provide a turn on, is a relatively shorter time period then that for ethylene. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you and for follow-up. I think Bob you mentioned that, roughly 20% of your ethylene is merchant ethylene and you announced potentially a new polyethylene plant. Would that basically close your merchant position, when the plant comes online? Bob Patel : No, it wouldn't close it completely. And frankly, P.J. we'd like to have some merchants positions. It's for us, that's another sort of optimization now that we have. Our ethylene and derivative value chain and as many of you know, we also can convert ethylene and propylene through our metathesis process. So when we think about merchant, we can kind of balance through producing propylene, but our aim longer term, is to have that merchant position somewhere in the 10% to 15% range overtime, and if you think about back in 2013 and 2014, that merchant position clearly served as well as part ethylene prices expanded. And so we'll have those kind periods and we think that, having some merchant position provide the opportunity to optimize the value chain even more. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan Ahmed : Bob, just wanted to revisit the whole MTO side of things. It seems to me that last couple of quarters, as ethylene prices have continued to come down. It seemed that there were a few new sort of MTO facilities in China, which were mechanically complete, but are still waiting for some sort of stability or positive inflection in ethylene pricing to start up. Now what's your view? Are those facilities beginning to come online? And the reason I asked that because obviously that could have a meaningful impact on methanol demand in pricing. Bob Patel : Well certainly, and it's difficult to assess unit-by-unit, but again if you step back and you look at demand growth. It seems to me, that more of the demand growth in Asia will be met by, it will be met with MTO-based polyethylene production. And so, today we're kind of in this period of trying to assess how many units are running or not and so on. And I think as we move through this year and go into next year. MTO will be an important part of satisfying their last increment of demand. And will be a more consisted price setter. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. Now moving onto the I&D segment. The sort of production volume numbers that you guys provide on a segment-by-segment level basis. Within that, if I take a look at the asset yield silo. It seems that there were big sort of jumps up on a year-over-year as well as quarter-over-quarter basis. If I have these numbers right, asset yields was up production volume-wise 28% year-over-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter. Now I know, there was some turnaround activities in Q4, but I'm just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of these sort of big volume moves. Bob Patel : I think, it is turnaround, but that turnaround was a very big turnaround in Q4 and it went a little longer that we had expected. So, I would say Q4 volume was lower even more so than we had expected because of the turnaround and the volumes are sustainable. Our contract portfolio is set up such that, Q1 volumes are kind of what you're expecting. Hassan Ahmed : So but what sort of underlying call it with within acetate and VAM, what sort of underlying demand growth are you seeing globally? Bob Patel : We're seeing reasonably good demand growth. I don't think it's anything unusually above trend line. But it's fairly steady from our perspective. Doug Pike : Hassan, I think the larger changes that you're seeing are really related to the two methanol plants and their output and turnaround in maintenance activity with them. And if you know as you look back, recall in 2014, the channel, the plant didn't run at full capacity. Adjustments were made in 2015, we bring that to full capacity late in 2015. You had the report [ph] turnaround. So I think what you're seeing is basically methanol volumes and maintenance and turnaround schedules. Hassan Ahmed : Very good, thank you guys. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Bob Koort : Bob, I was looking into your supply demand curve, it looks like maybe there's a little iteration for some slower demand there. So the operating rate comes down a little bit, more than maybe we'd seen in the past going into 18. And I guess relative to the interesting chart, you have on the right side of the Slide 15. I'm wondering, how should we think about the margin half, as we go to those operating rates that look similar maybe there's 2012 or 2013 period. I mean, I recall back then the naphtha guys in Asia didn't make any money. So should we assume pricing would go on top of that MTO, north of Asia MTO price or is, there's some reason to think maybe they could retain some margin in that kind of global operating rate environment. Bob Patel : I think again, it depends on how that balance develops, but if we step back. The way I think about this cycle, whatever it turns out to be. It looks to be fairly shallow. I think there's a few characteristics about what lies ahead that's different then what we've had in the past. In the past decades or past cycles. Now this time, first of all we don't see operating rates dropping into the low 80s, like we've seen in the past. This is kind of around 90% plus or minus depending on timing of capacity expansion, how demand develops as you say. The other thing that I think is very different about this cycle was, the US is positioning in the top quartile of the cost curve. So we're going to run our asset hard. And if you think about the fourth quartile, MTO does become more meaningful, as time goes on. And so to your point, that ought to be more and more the price setter. And as all price rises going into presumably rises, going into 17 and 18. We ought to see, the slope of this cost curve maybe you know inch up some and so, you got to look at margins I think in that context. And also the operating rates, they're going to be on either side of balance. They're not dropping as low as 80%, as they have in the past. Bob Koort : Got it, that's helpful. Thank you. Bob Patel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jim Sheehan of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Jim Sheehan : Could you take a little bit about free cash flow in the quarter? It dipped a little bit. What is your outlook for free cash flow for the rest of the year? And do you think, that working capital changes influence what happened in the first quarter? Bob Patel : Well, I'll start with that and then Thomas will supplement certainly. I think, first of all working capital changes. We don't think they're going to significantly - we're not going to be really material with our cash flow development. If you look back at the last 12 months, our free cash flow yield is been about 10%, 11% in that range. They've been double digits for quite some time. So I think our cash flow generation should continue to be pretty strong and Thomas, I don't know if you want to add more. Thomas Aebischer : No, I don't think I can add more here. The cash flow generation for 2016 is going to be strong, as we've seen in the past. As we have talked at our year-end call. The CapEx expenditures are going to be higher in 2016 versus 2015. So that obviously, when we look at the free cash flow perspective were impacted, but we're expecting strong cash flow generation, net working capital no significant changes expected to-date. Jim Sheehan : Very good and also on, could you talk about the - how you're thinking about M&A these days. Is there any view to diversifying the company further or how would you look at? You've got a very strong balance sheet here. Where does M&A fall in your uses of cash priorities? Bob Patel : Well, there's really no change in our position regarding M&A. I think, I've talked about this entire call, so that we like first of all from a portfolio standpoint. We think that, the O&P and I&D value change provide a very white plain field and then I think, both play to our strengths of running large scale operations, safely, reliability. We know how to manage cost well. We understand cycles and we know, how to do well in all parts of cycle. So as we think about cash flow deployment. And we think about various options and certainly, we study all kinds of alternative. So I don't think our positions has changed on M&A. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Mr. Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Sir your line is now open. Frank Mitsch : And just quickly follow-up on that, that obviously begs the questions. You're on share buyback, you're going to your shareholders to get more approval. Is this 2.8% per quarter rate is at kind of the baseline thinking right now? Bob Patel : Yes, so in May. Frank, hopefully get approval for this next 10% and we'll commence that program. Our approach is been, we would do these 10% programs up to 18 months kind of timeframe. So, we'll evaluate that, you've seen us increase the pace in Q4, when we thought it was even better value in our shares and so, I think we'll continue to evaluate that. Frank Mitsch : Thank you and then following up on I&D. The PO and derivatives business of material volume growth sequential and you also pointed out, how the PG margins were essentially flat Q1 versus Q4. But you said, that your margins were down due to sales mix. Can you elaborate on what's going on in that business and what we should be expecting in Q2 and beyond? Bob Patel : Well I&D in terms of Q1, it was really on oxyfuels. We had a couple of things going on there. Seasonally, Q1 is usually weak in terms of margins. And in addition to that, as I mentioned during the refining discussion, when premiums came in, gasoline inventories were high. So it was kind of an unusual period where, in additional to the seasonal impacts. We had some down draft in margins and we kind of see, already we see oxyfuel margins coming back. So that was an important feature, but frankly part of that was offset by pretty good styrene margins and we think those should continue. Doug Pike : And frank, within the volumes as you look at the volumes. If you recall fourth quarter, we had maintenance turnaround at our French, PO plant. So that affects both the propylene oxide and the oxyfuels businesses. And then, we also had the maintenance going on across ethylene glycol and the acetyl. So fourth quarter volumes pretty heavily affected by maintenance. First quarter really reflects all assets up and running. There's a little bit of mix effect across PO. You got to compare it as a global business and as different events occur in the industry, often with other players. Which parts of the globe you're going to be supplying. But in general, I think if you went back over our past five years. The way you see is a typical comment about propylene oxide and derivatives is a very stable quarter-to-quarter profitability. Frank Mitsch : And in terms of the mix effects, that's really a Q1 sort of an issue and not something that we should count on for Q2 and beyond. Bob Patel : [Indiscernible] fuel, seasonality. I think that's when you boil it down, kind of net-net, that's what it is. Frank Mitsch : Thank you, so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Nils Wallin of CLSA. Sir, your line is now open. Nils Wallin : I was wondering, if you could update on your thoughts on PO/TBA plant, when you would expect to make a final decision and if you do go ahead with it, how that might affect your ability or your interest in doing buybacks while it is being built? Bob Patel : So, we're progressing that project. We're doing detailed engineering as we speak and we would expect sometime in the first half of next year to make final investment decision, with a projected start-up date of about mid-2020. And that's currently where we on that project, Nils. And we evaluate lot of different scenarios in terms of our cash flow deployment and so on. And so I would say, more broadly I see us being able to support and continue to invest in that project through whatever is ahead of us in the next three four years and in terms of share buybacks, we're always evaluating that as one of our options in deploying cash flows. So when you look further out, I think we're going to continue to develop a variety of options. But remember, our aim is to meaningfully create shareholder value and continue to generate the strong cash flow, that we've been known to generate. Nils Wallin : Of course, that's helpful. Thanks. And just another questions back on ethane. I think that they understand is that those, plenty of ethane out there in terms of you know potential capacity supply and rejection. But I'm curious as the new plants, new ethylene plants come on stream. Do we have to get the sources of ethane from further out locations like the Marcellus or the Bakken and how might those deliver cost to supply the incremental demand effect the ethane price? Bob Patel : I think there could be periods where Marcellus ethane is needed, but if you think about the amount of new consumptive capacity that's coming. It's something in that 400,000 barrels per day sort of range, by mid-to-late 18s. But the price of ethane, I think where it also needs to be considered in the context of, propane price in the context of butane price. And also, if Marcellus ethane is needed then you know my view is that, Eagle Ford ethane and Permian and Haynesville is even more profitable because it's much closer to Gulf Coast. So I would imagine that there would some supply response from more closer in production of ethane and the market is out of balance. Nils Wallin : Got it, that's very helpful. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Laurence Alexander : Just two quick ones. What's your thinking now about the incentive to shut naphtha capacity given the MTO dynamic that you outlined? And secondly, as you think about the European prospects in the medium term. The extent that ethane exports can effectively provide an alternate for the price mechanism and possibly provide a bit of support of naphtha margins in Europe. Bob Patel : Well I think first of all in terms of naphtha crackers. We're not expecting rationalization either in Europe or in Asia, for naphtha crackers. Most of what was going to get done earlier in the decade. And as far as ethane setting the ethylene price in Europe. I don't think that's going to be the case because I think the mainstream market still kind of settles on naphtha and supply demand and I expect that to continue. But I suspect that those who have the ability to crack something other than imported methane. Then they'll kind of run those economics and they'll import more or less depending on whether ethane based ethylene make sense in Europe or not. I don't think that will become a price setter in Europe. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the lien of Mr. Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Jonas Oxgaard : So question on ethylene North America. So you're adding another couple of hundred thousand tonnes. Other people are adding left and right and no derivatives. How much more ethylene do you think, North America can absorb being going to cash cost? And when would that happen, you think? Bob Patel : Well, I think it's just sort of timing of derivatives and ethylene expansions and when you kind of look at turnarounds and so on, these increments are not that big to change the underlying ethylene supply demand dynamic. So our sense is that, there's still more derivative capacity in the aggregate and that, we ourselves have already a view on, where we're going to place our ethylene. So and longer term, I think we'll see more derivatives come on and some of these cracker start up. So we don't see it quite that dramatic frankly. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay, how long would it actually take for you to get your derivatives online, once you finally announce it? Bob Patel : Well, so our polyethylene expansion that we're advancing. We're aiming for sometime in 2019 to have production. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this point, we have no further questions in the queue. Speakers you may proceed. Bob Patel : Okay, well thank you. Well let me just close with few comments before everyone disconnects. I want to just summarize by telling you, little bit about where I think our priorities are for Q2. To me, they're pretty clear. I think we got to get the refinery expeditiously and safely return to normal operation. We have our large turnaround at Corpus Christi and the expansion that will follow. For as I mentioned, we're aiming to start that up in late Q3. And then ultimately, we had a more higher level. Our aim is to really maximize cash flow during this very balanced and tight market environment, not only in the US but globally. From a financial perspective, assuming that we receive shareholder approval will start our fourth 10% share repurchase program in May and so we look forward to updating you on progress on all these items and others in July. Thanks for your continued interest in our company. Operator : Thank you and that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Douglas J. Pike: Okay. Well, thank you, Tony. Well, thank you, all and hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's second quarter 2016 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO; and Thomas Aebischer, our CFO, who is calling from our Rotterdam office. Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Now for more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com. And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time today until 1 AM Eastern Time on August 29 by calling 866-453-2318 in the United States, and 203-369-1226 outside the United States. And the passcode for both numbers is 72916. And during today's call, we'll focus on second quarter results, the current environment, and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the non-cash, lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the volatility and prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And second quarter price recoveries for impacted products resulted in the reversal of the entire $68 million first quarter LCM charge. Interim LCM charges are reversed in subsequent periods when information shows the LCM charge may not be sustained through yearend. However, I'd also remind you that LCM charges that exist at yearend cannot be reversed. Additionally, if there are future price declines within our inventory pools during the remainder of the year, this could lead to additional LCM charges. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. Now with that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Thanks, Doug. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide four and review the highlights from the second quarter. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share declined relative to the first quarter to $2.45 per share with EBITDA of $1.7 billion. This excludes the $68 million lower of cost or market inventory gain. When the gain on sale of the Petroken Argentine business is also excluded from first quarter results, underlying earnings per share in the second quarter increased by $0.15 per share. Overall, second quarter business trends were as we had expected. During the quarter our downstream integration in polyolefins and other olefin derivatives enabled us to capture strong chain margins. Positive seasonal oxyfuel margin trends benefited the Intermediates & Derivatives business. While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was scheduled maintenance and some unplanned downtime across company. Most significantly, the refinery operated at reduced rates throughout the quarter as repairs were required following a fire in our coker unit in April. The refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of second quarter loss production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $140 million. The ability to generate strong earnings during a period of heavy planned maintenance and a refinery upset is indicative of our solid portfolio. We progressed our financial priorities during the quarter as well and Thomas will provide you with an update on those in a few moments. Slide five reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. As I mentioned, during the first half of this year we performed an unusually high amount maintenance. Periods like this often result in an increased number of injuries. However, our results remained steady. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on safety has resulted in the excellent performance we have seen over the past four years. Now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the second quarter. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, both, and good morning. On slide six, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined olefins and polyolefins generated good results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA in the second quarter and $5.5 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment remained steady with second quarter EBITDA of approximately $370 million and $1.5 billion over the last 12 months. Due to operating issues, the refinery recorded a loss. Technology continued to perform well at an LTM pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and global economic uncertainties, our profitability has remained strong with $7.5 billion of EBITDA over the past 12 months. The first half 2016 EBITDA represents an annual pace of nearly $7.2 billion. Please turn to slide seven, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized $1.1 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to approximately $560 million during the second quarter with a significant portion of this investment focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Berre, France facility. During the second quarter cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $400 million to end with a balance of $2.5 billion. Over the last 12 months cash from operations was $5.5 billion. A nearly equal amount was dedicated to dividends and share repurchases over the same period. After investments in our capital program, returns to our shareholders, borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investments balance declined by approximately $1.3 billion. However, at $2.5 billion this remains well above our minimum requirement. Slide eight provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase shares. In May 2016, we increased our quarterly interim dividend by 9% to $0.85 per share. Additionally, our results have allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet, BBB/Baa1 corporate credit rating and available liquidity of approximately $5 billion. During the first six months of 2016, cash flow generation remained strong although somewhat less than the pace seen in 2014 and 2015. On an annualized basis, using June 30 market capitalization, the cash flow yield is 9.4%. Our share repurchase program remained at an approximate 10% annual pace. During the quarter, we purchased 8.8 million shares representing 2% of our outstanding shares with approximately 4 million shares purchased during June. Notably, during May, we received approval for our fourth share repurchase program for up to an additional 10% of outstanding shares over the next 18 months. Based on the June 30 share price and the May quarterly dividend increase to $0.85 per share, the current dividend yield is approximately 4.6%. Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that may help your modeling. First, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%, several percentage points lower than our previously communicated estimate. The rate variance for the quarter compared to our forecasted annual rate was impacted primarily by discrete items including the impact of a non-U.S. tax law change, as well as by our global earnings mix being balanced towards lower tax regions. We currently estimate our full-year tax rate at approximately 27%, which is approximately 1 percentage point below our previous estimate. 2016 CapEx spending is on target to meet our forecast of $2.1 billion. Depreciation, amortization and interest expense are currently running at rates in line with our previous estimate. With that, thank you very much for your attention and I will turn the call back to Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide nine and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory gain. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment second quarter EBITDA was $754 million. Results declined by $67 million, excluding the first quarter gain of $57 million on the sale of the Petroken polypropylene business. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results were generally unchanged. Ethylene prices improved by approximately $0.04 per pound and our margins improved while customer and internal derivative plant maintenance resulted in reduced ethylene volumes. Our operating rates during the quarter averaged approximately 80% due to the planned maintenance and expansion at our Corpus Christi facility. Excluding the Corpus Christi outage, quarterly rates were approximately 90%. During the quarter, we operated our metathesis unit but the contribution was not material. 74% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs. We initiated the Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion during mid April with completion planned for the end of the third quarter. At industry benchmark margins, second quarter lost production impact was estimated to be approximately $65 million. However, all but approximately $15 million was offset by purchases and inventory management during prior quarters. In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $60 million. Results were driven by lower polyethylene and polypropylene volumes. Approximately, half of the polyethylene volume decline was due to scheduled plant maintenance. Polypropylene volumes declined 5% primarily due to lower sales following the first quarter sale of Petroken. Polyethylene price spreads were relatively unchanged while propylene's price declined by approximately $0.02 per pound, several cents less than industry data would indicate. Thus far, during the third quarter, Olefins & Polyolefins Americas' industry trends are relatively unchanged. Our heavy planned maintenance schedule continues into the quarter. The Corpus Christi plant is scheduled to remain down throughout the quarter. Two weeks ago, we began a turnaround in our Morris, Illinois facility. At current industry benchmarks, the net value of lost third quarter production is estimated to be approximately $135 million. Let's turn to slide 10 and a review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, underlying EBITDA was $536 million. Exclusive of a $21 million first quarter gain from the Argentine Petroken sale, EBITDA was relatively unchanged. Olefin results declined by approximately $30 million as increased feedstock cost outpaced olefin price increases. A turnaround at our Berre facility impacted olefin and polyolefin production during both the first and second quarters. At industry benchmark margins, the second quarter value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $35 million, $20 million greater than the first quarter impact. Advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production contributing approximately $25 million over naphtha and polyolefins results were relatively unchanged. Exclusive of the gain from Petroken sale, our polypropylene compounding and polybutene-1 results improve by about $10 million. Joint Venture equity income was very strong, increasing by $27 million consistent with strong polyolefin margins. During the early weeks of the third quarter, underlying industry conditions have followed expectations and remain relatively unchanged. However, the third quarter is typically impacted by slower seasonal conditions. During the quarter, there is no significant maintenance planned at our wholly-owned facilities, but there will be some at our joint ventures. Now please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivative segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $369 million, an improvement of $15 million versus the first quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $20 million, partially due to sales, product mix and derivative margins. This was offset by an improvement in the intermediate chemicals of approximately $10 million. Styrene margins were the leading factor with an improvement of approximately $0.04 per pound versus the first quarter. Higher oxyfuels volumes and seasonal margin increases contributed approximately $30 million more than the first quarter results. Thus far in the third quarter, PO and derivatives and intermediate chemical industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the second quarter. However, weaker gasoline markets have negatively impacted oxyfuels. This is seen on the slide in the reduction of the July MTBE margins. Additionally, a turnaround at our Bayport EO/EG plant is estimated to impact third quarter results by approximately $15 million. Let's move to slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was a loss of $13 million, a decline of $27 million from the prior quarter. Crude throughput averaged 183,000 barrels per day as rates were impacted by the April 8 fire and other maintenance. During the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread increased by $3.21 per barrel to average $21.07 for the quarter. However, due to our processing limitations, we were not able to benefit from the increased spreads. Based on the second quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity is estimated to be approximately $85 million. Repairs are now complete and the refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. As you can see on the slide, during July, industry spreads trended downward. Additionally, the cost of RINs increased following the issuance of new EPA guidelines. Compared to the second quarter, market RIN price July month-to-date has increased by approximately $0.17 per gallon. At full refinery rates, every $0.10 change in the RIN cost is estimated to impact quarterly cross by approximately $5 million. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with second quarter EBITDA of $73 million. I will conclude with slide 16. Second quarter industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. We continued to see strong results in global olefins and polyolefins businesses. Our I&D segment benefited from strengthening styrene margins and seasonal oxyfuel improvements. Refining results were impacted by the refinery coker unit fire. Our solid cash flow enabled us to increase our dividend and extend our share repurchase program. In the near-term, we believe that olefin and polyolefin markets will remain balanced with periods of potential tightness. Our refinery has returned to normal operation. Due to recent gasoline market changes, our oxyfuels and Refining business are experiencing some margin pressure. We continue to invest in our facilities with third quarter planned maintenance turnarounds at two olefin sites and our EO/EG facility at Bayport. At recent industry margins, we estimate the impact of the related production loss in the third quarter to be approximately $150 million. However, this maintenance is the foundation for continued reliability over the coming years. Due to our unusually high planned maintenance schedule this year, the value of lost production through the first three quarters based upon the industry benchmark margins is estimated be approximately $300 million. In contrast, next year's schedule is quite light. Within chemicals, there are no olefin plant turnarounds and only one PO plant turnaround. The refinery will also have a fluid unit turnaround. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that in a separate press release to be issued shortly, you will see that we have made the final investment decision for a new 1.1 billion pound per year polyethylene line. Startup is targeted to occur during 2019. This facility represents an 18% increase in our U.S. polyethylene capacity. Additionally, it is the first of its kind process combining attributes of both of our polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. As a result the product capabilities will range from basic benchmark resins through to higher value-added grades. We are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Stephen Byrne : Yes. Thank you. It looks to us like polyethylene imports by China year-to-date are a little below year ago levels. Just wondering if you think that's a reasonably good metric for demand in Asia. Anything that you're seeing that would suggest any softening in polyolefin demand in that region? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Good morning, Steve. I think the imports of polyethylene into Asia or into China are generally they do vary because of inventory changes and planned outages and so on. But what we're seeing is still very solid growth in Asia year-over-year. So I would not read too much into just that import statistic. Stephen Byrne : And any root cause of that refinery fire that you found meaningful or lessons learned from that that you'd care to share? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Well, we've corrected what we found and we've checked out more than just the source of that fire. So we think we've addressed the root causes and we understand those well. And the refinery is back up and running at full rates. Stephen Byrne : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thank you. What's the startup date on the new polyethylene unit and could you give us an update on the propylene oxide project as well? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Sure. So the startup we're estimating to be mid-2019. And that's progressing very well. The PO/TBA project, we're continuing with our front-end engineering and so that project is progressing very nicely. We expect to make a final investment decision in the first half of next year, but it looks good so far. John Roberts : And are you basically longed at ethylene in the marketplace until the startup of the polyethylene unit? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Well, we've been a merchant seller of ethylene and we place some of that Corpus Christi volume already. And so over time, yes, that's our intention is through the addition of this derivative capacity, we would move towards our long-term target of something around 15% of our ethylene as merchant sales. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to get your tenor on the markets right now. You discussed a balancing environment. How would you describe your customer inventory levels? How would you discuss polyethylene pricing. We have seen some movement up in spot ethylene in the last couple weeks and it looks like the polyethylene price declines that were expected in July have been pushed out to August. Maybe you could just discuss what you're seeing on demand and your expectations for polyethylene pricing for the next maybe, say, six months. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Good morning, Arun. We're seeing very balanced markets. The demand is growing very solidly year-over-year. As in prior calls, we've talked about this that lot of polyethylene and polypropylene demand is tied to everyday use, sort of, applications. And so that's evidenced in the growth rate despite some uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and we're seeing that play through in terms of demand growth globally. It has been pretty solid year-over-year. Because of planned and unplanned outages in the industry, including our planned maintenance that we're doing at Corpus, the market seemed to be balanced to tight. Our sense is that inventories are about average or below average. So my view is that in the next quarter or two markets should be pretty well-balanced and anything unplanned would create tightness in markets. There's a reasonable planned maintenance schedule both in the U.S. and Asia in Q3. So I think that will keep things pretty well-balanced to tight for most of the remainder of the year. Arun Viswanathan : Just as a follow-up on the cost side, ethane has also come off. Maybe you can just give us your view on ethane and propane over the next couple quarters as well. Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Sure. Ethane came off a little here because there were some unplanned cracker outages. There's some turnarounds going on. So ethane demand has been off some. Propane looks to be pretty long. And we think that propane will play an important role in setting the price of ethane, not only in the near-term but also longer term. And so for now we see an abundance of ethane supply. And, as I've mentioned in prior calls, over the medium-term, we'll expect for ethane to trade a little bit over its fuel value. Historically, it's traded $0.05 to $0.10 over and that still affords the U.S. a reasonable feedstock advantage, and in a tight market environment like we have today, it provides for a good backdrop for solid earnings. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David I. Begleiter: Thank you, Bob. Polypropylene margins have come off pretty hard since Q1. Can you discuss your expectations for the back half of the year and any potential for this to improve? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Good morning, David. Yes, polypropylene margins, last time we spoke there was pretty wide gap between Asia and the U.S. And we'd said that that would come in some, partly with Asian prices coming up, which they did, and U.S. prices coming off a bit. I think we've reached that delta where likely we don't see a whole lot more. If you step back and look at supply/demand and especially here in the U.S., there's not a lot of new supply coming in. And there is growth year-over-year. So I expect the polypropylene market in the U.S. to be relatively balanced to tight over the coming quarters. And we don't really see meaningful new capacity in the U.S. for a couple of years. There might be some debottlenecks, but I think it's probably two, three years out before we see new grassroots capacity. David I. Begleiter: And, Bob, you did highlight again strength in styrene in the quarter. Could you discuss your outlook for styrene over the next maybe six to 12 months here? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Yes, styrene demand continues to grow. Again, no real new capacity in the near term. So we're pretty constructive about styrene, and we haven't had the opportunity to say that very often in the past few years, but it seems like there is some resilience in the market and we'd expect that to continue. David I. Begleiter: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open. James M. Sheehan: Yes, could you discuss your priorities for cash allocation? You've got a lot of free cash flow and you went over some of the dividends and share buyback that you've done in the past. Are you considering M&A to be more of the mix going forward? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Let me start and then I'd ask Thomas to also jump in. But, Jim, our free cash flow so far we've deployed it towards a very strong dividend and share buyback program, and I would say over time as we ramp up on our growth projects, certainly we'll use some of that cash flow to fund these growth projects. In terms of M&A, there's not a lot of change from what we've discussed in prior calls. We'd have to see a clear path to value creation to consider M&A. It's certainly something that many companies think about, but for us, we've got to make sure we know clear path to value creation. So, Thomas, I don't know if there's anything more you'd like to add to that? Thomas Aebischer : No, thank you very much for the question. So, as you see and as I have mentioned in my comments, we are in the fortunate situation with a strong balance sheet. Clearly we are committed, as we have repeatedly said, to a progressive dividend policy. We maintained the dividend. We were able to increase the dividend again to 9%, which we have mentioned. And we've just got another approval for another 10% share buyback over the next 18 months. So we're in the fortunate situation to execute on our financial objectives. James M. Sheehan: Thank you. And on the polyethylene unit, you're timing it for mid-2019. Looks like that the environment for delays is a hot topic. How have you evaluated the potential for delays in the industry and the resources that are needed in timing your own project? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : I think generally, Jim, we're timing the construction of this project quite well, because it will be post some of the large greenfield projects completing construction. So I like our position there. And in terms of delays, they're always difficult to forecast, but if you look back at history and including some of our debottlenecks, these are very large, complicated plants, and so we've seen delays with not only some of our debottlenecks but also other projects, and we expect some of that to occur, which frankly has some implications on how operating rates turn out in 2018 and 2019. But I like our position in terms of the construction cycle. James M. Sheehan: Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Excuse me, P.J. Juvekar, your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar: Can you hear me? I'm sorry. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Yes, we can hear you, P.J. Go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Sorry about that. So there is a large price gap between Asian ethylene, which is $0.20 higher than U.S. ethylene, and the situation could get potentially worse in 2017. So how do you see this resolving? You are building a new polyethylene plant. Some of the MLP companies are talking about ethylene exports. So how and when do think the situation gets resolved? Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Well, I think, P.J., we're going to have to look at ethylene prices more regionally rather than globally. So it's more important in my view to look at polyethylene prices globally. So to the extent that the Asian price is the price setter, then I think that's what we have to watch. Ethylene exports out of the U.S., I think they can only be good for the U.S. ethylene market. So it's a relief valve if you will, for the U.S. ethylene business. So if those are to be built, I would consider that to be a net positive for U.S. ethylene producers. P.J. Juvekar: And I wanted to go back to your ethane comment on the medium-term. There are some new crackles coming up. You have ethane exports going up. But balancing that what is your outlook for supply, particularly on the Gulf Coast, in Eagle Ford and Permian? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Yes. Well, there's still a significant amount of rejection that's occurring, even some still in Eagle Ford and then places more further away. P.J., I think what's going to be important to see is how propane and butane prices develop because part of what will balance markets is feedstock flexibility. That's something that we're very focused on for the long run is to continue to find ways to increase feedstock flexibility. The cracker fleet in the U.S. has a reasonable amount of feedstock flexibility, which if ethane prices were to rise above let's say propane or butane economics, then a lot of us could switch, which would take some of that pressure off of ethane. The other thing is in a low oil price environment, I would think that some of the ethane exports could be more variable, and they could be shut off if ethane price were to rise. So I think there's balancing factors in the market from a supply standpoint. With some premium over fuel value and with oil price moderately rising over time, I would think that that will attract more supply. So we think this will balance out over time. And also the timing of startups of crackers will impact that too, right. So there are delays, then that pushes out that tightness of ethane and more time for more ethane productions to come to market. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you for your detailed answer. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. Don Carson : Thank you. Bob, you recently announced that you're going to delay your planned expansion at Channelview in ethylene. So wondering if you could go over the rationale for that. Was that related to the fact that you just don't think the returns are there right now at current prospective margins, or is that more of a strategic issue that you just want to not expand your merchant ethylene position? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Yes. So that project looks very good to us, even in today's environment. So we didn't delay it for economic reasons. It's really a matter of priority. First of all, we've got a lot going on in Channelview where that debottleneck was to be done. That's a large part of our PO/TBA project potentially as we go forward. So we have a certain number of resources and we've got to deploy those in a way where we can focus and execute well. So we want the team over there focusing on PO/TBA. Also if you look more broadly in the company, near-term our priority is more to build out our derivative portfolio. And then in time we'll come back and do that debottleneck. When we do our turnarounds at our Channelview crackers in 2018 and 2019, we'll likely be able to put in tie-ins such that we can implement that debottleneck any time and it may not have to be dependent on a turnaround. So we're going to do that project at some point. But I'd like for us to focus in the near-term on the polyethylene plant and on PO/TBA and build out our derivatives, and then we'll come back and take a look at that one. Don Carson : I've got a follow-up on polypropylene. You mentioned that your spreads were only down $0.02 in the quarter, which certainly was a lot less than the overall decline we saw in North America. So was this something unique to Lyondell in terms of your sales mix or was this just the consultants getting the data wrong? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : No, I think it has to do with our sales mix and geographic mix. Don Carson : So would that imply that there's more downside to come in Q3 and the second half in general that some of this industry reduction in spreads has been delayed at Lyondell? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : No, not necessarily. We don't really see that. Don Carson : Great, okay. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vincent Stephen Andrews : Thanks and good morning. Bob, if I heard you correctly, you said you ran at 80% rate in the U.S., 90% ex-Corpus Christi, and I'm just wondering what types of rates we should be thinking about going forward. At least I can think back over the past two years or so and sometimes those rates were at or above 100%. So whether it's that's sort of rate we should be thinking about going forward. Douglas J. Pike: Hi, Vincent, this is Doug. If you think going forward, really the key thing is that we do have the two facilities in turn around. Otherwise, everything should be running full. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Yes, and so the two facilities are Corpus and Morris. And remember, Morris is an integrated ethylene, polyethylene site. So when we're not making ethylene, we don't run polyethylene up there either. But otherwise our plan is to run full for the rest of the year. Vincent Stephen Andrews : So something around 100% then? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Yes. That should be near the base. Vincent Stephen Andrews : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Securities. Your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. Could you talk about your outlook for propylene? There is some new seaborne exports of propylene out of the U.S. and inventories appear to be low. On the other hand, there's new PDH unit in the startup mode. Any prospects for higher price for this monomer? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : I think propylene prices depend a lot on where propane is and refinery rates and so on. Our sense is that with the new PDH units that are being built propylene looks to be coming more in the balance and could be long here in the U.S. over the medium-term. So we're watching that but the feedstocks do have a role to play in how much propylene is produced and when propane is favored, the crackers that have flexibility tend to produce a lot more propylene. Aleksey Yefremov : So it sounds like you think the export facility is not a big deal basically for the U.S. market? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Well, for propylene there have been exports in the U.S. for some time. And so, I think it has a role. But I would summarize my comment by saying that, I think propylene is going to move towards a long position as some of this new PDH capacity comes on and if there are derivatives, if they are lagging then it becomes a bit long. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. And then turning to MTBE, what is the supply/demand balance there, especially on the demand side. Outside of seasonality, is there any reason to be worried that sort of that octane value that MTBE was getting over the last year or so is diminishing? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : No. I think this has been more of a gasoline phenomenon that you've seen this year in terms of spreads. Our view about MTBE longer term and we still think octane is short. When you think about new fuel regulations, they are requiring us to take sulfur out of the gasoline pool, which reduces octane and then also on a demand side more and more higher compression engines require more octane. So our view is that octane is tight to short and MTBE plays an important role in that. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan I. Ahmed: Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed: Bob, question around the I&D segment. You know, as I was taking a look at your sales volumes, the asset yield volume sequentially saw a big jump-up. We are talking, if I've run my numbers correctly, you are around 17%. So I'm just trying to figure out, you guys have reported a 17% rise in acetyl volumes Q1 to Q2. While one of your big competitors reported double-digit volume declines again for the same time period. So, I'm just trying to understand clearly the market is a bit oversupplied. So, is there an element of sort of gaining market share at the cost of pricing going on over there? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : For us it was more about just running methanol at higher rates and also we had some planned maintenance earlier in the year on the van (43:36) unit and now that's done. So we ran at higher rates in Q2. Hassan I. Ahmed: Fair enough. Okay. Now moving on, obviously a lot of questions on this call as well as on previous calls about ethane. Clearly, a lot of paranoia sort of about ethane potentially jumping up significantly. Now, even partially is there a desire on your part maybe even sort of small, you know, one facility or a few facilities to at least try to lock into some longer-term contract in terms of ethane? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : We have an ongoing sort of contracting strategy around ethane. We are one of the bigger buyers of ethane from the Gulf Coast. I think we buy the largest right now. So we have a very balanced strategy around buying ethane. I will come back to my earlier comments which I think around ethane is we have to think about what are the balancing factors on ethane price. And, again, I think propane and butane will play an important role, also exports. Some of those could be variable at very high ethane prices so I think the market will balance. The other thing if ethane values persist at much higher than its fuel value that ought to attract more supply or incent more supply. And so really I think what we're all concerned about here, I suppose, is more about the volatility not about some structural change and how ethane will be priced. I think as we saw earlier in this decade, when ethane price rose and margins on ethane over fuel value were $0.30 per gallon or $0.40 per gallon that was met with a lot more supply. And so we think that these crackers start up and so on, a combination of switching to other feedstocks, maybe less exports and more supply, the market will find a new equilibrium and that leave us in a position where the U.S. still has advantage vis-\u00e0-vis heavier crackers globally. Hassan I. Ahmed: Super. Thanks so much, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Nils Wallin from CLSA. Your line is now open. Nils- Bertil Wallin : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to Corpus, the delay, the turnaround is extended. I'm curious was this extension due to lower efficiency? Was that did you have some issues getting equipment or are you just trying to help the market find a little bit more balance into the back half of the year? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : No, Nils, we'd like to get this done as soon as possible. So it's really about just the complexity in the construction and the debottlenecks are very, very complex, because we are working in tight spaces and so on. But having said all that, we are a few weeks later than we had anticipated. We are expecting to be done by the end of September and commissioning. The other thing is when we started the turnaround and especially in June and early July, we had some very, very unusual weather patterns, had a lot of \u2013 we had a few days where we couldn't be in the field because of lightning and heavy rains. So on the Texas Gulf Coast those things do have an impact at this time of year. But we're aiming to get that done by the end of Q3. Nils- Bertil Wallin : Understood. And just on polyethylene expansions this year. Obviously the Mexico plants have taken a while to get up. Some JVs in the Gulf Coast are apparently getting pushed out. Saudi Arabia had some issues as well and is not up. So are these delays going to \u2013 will they be sufficient to allow demand to grow into the capacity growth or is there a risk that at some point all this capacity comes on stream in the next six to 12 months and the market is surprised by a supply shock? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : I think, again, you are highlighting that these projects are complex and they don't tend to start up as people plan and hope, including our debottleneck, as I just mentioned. So I think with delays, as you say, demand will grow into the capacity. And we see a pretty balanced market through the balance of this year and well into next year. And then we'll just have to see how the timing develops on the other big projects. But they are quite large and complex and it's just history indicates that a quarter or two delays are not unusual. Nils- Bertil Wallin : Understood. Thanks very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Frank J. Mitsch: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Good morning, Frank. Frank J. Mitsch: I was wondering, obviously volumes were off in Olefin, Polyolefins Americas due to the planned/unplanned outages, customer turnarounds, et cetera. And you mentioned that your plan is to run flat out for the balance of the year ex the Corpus and Morris turnarounds. How should we think about sequentially Q3 versus Q2 volumes in O&P Americas given those factors? Would you expect it to be up, flat or down Q3 versus Q2? Douglas J. Pike: Production will be lower, Frank, right, because of Morris being down and the timing of that turnaround. So that's one of the things you have to factor in. That's also going to put some pressure and impact kind of polyethylene, as Bob said. So, I think you'll see that. We had some maintenance and turnarounds planned work in the second quarter. So, that you will probably see hold pretty even I think across the quarters. But we will see ethylene production being down. Frank J. Mitsch: All right. Terrific. And then just to clarify, you are expecting a $10 million sequential headwind from planned/unplanned outages Q3 versus Q2, correct? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Well, we said in our prepared comments that third quarter production loss would result in about $150 million impact for the quarter. Frank J. Mitsch: Right. But sequentially you were off $140 million, so it's just a modest \u2013 if we're looking sequentially, correct? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Yeah. Douglas J. Pike: Yeah. No, of course, with the $140 million you are considering the refinery in there. Frank J. Mitsch: Fair enough. And then, lastly, you mentioned a 1.1 billion pound polyethylene plant scheduled to come online mid-2019. What are the capital costs associated with that facility? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Well, we're in the low to mid $0.60 per pound range for \u2013 per annual pound of capacity. Frank J. Mitsch: All right. Terrific. Because we actually \u2013 there's a lot of facilities that are bumping against the dollar per pound range. So, terrific. Thanks so much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open. Duffy Fischer : Yeah. good morning, fellows. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer : Question on Europe which just seems to keep doing better and better. And I am getting some pushback from folks that it might be too good to be true. Can you just walk through how much of the European improvement over the last several years you think is kind of structural and therefore sustainable, and how much of that will be susceptible to the cycle over the next three or four years? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Yeah. Duffy, if you think about the improvement, probably about half of it is structural based on feedstock improvements, fixed cost improvements and so on. The rest is more market related. But having said that, if you think about the European market, there is really no new capacity coming. The euro is weaker than it was two, three years ago. We had $1.4 euro-dollar. Today, we're $1.1. So my sense is that Europe will kind of be an insular market. I don't see a whole lot going out or coming in. And with no new capacity being installed in olefins and polyolefins there and demand growing modestly but growing some, we see a pretty balanced market. So I think the operating rates ought to be reasonably high over there. Duffy Fischer : Okay. Thank you. And then coming back to the U.S., we were long derivative capacity, short ethylene. That seems to have flipped. When you look out over the next three or four years with the capacity additions in the U.S., when do you think we get to the maximum point of being long ethylene, short derivative capacity? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Well, I would suspect that will be some time back-half 2018, into 2019. But, Duffy, not all of the derivative capacity has been announced yet. So just like we're announcing today our polyethylene plant. And so I think that will balance out. But on paper, you would assume that it's something in that back half of 2018, 2019 range. Duffy Fischer : Terrific. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Jonas Oxgaard : Hey, guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Hi, Jonas. Jonas Oxgaard : A question on polypropylene in Europe. Normally, polypropylene in Europe ties to polyethylene. But in the last six months, we've seen the polypropylene like 200 or so below polyethylene. Any comments on that and whether that will persist? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : No. I think the European market just has a different underpinning, given the feedstock and olefin prices there. So our sense is that that should continue for the foreseeable future. Jonas Oxgaard : You don't think polypropylene will rise up to polyethylene anytime soon. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : No. Polypropylene is a little bit \u2013 in about flat or a little bit less than ethylene over there. So I think you've got to step back and look at global pricing as well to be instructive on that. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay. And on the U.S. side, you talked a little about the propylene exports. But, right now we are only exporting to Colombia. If we were to start cracking more propane and then some of these PDH plants actually come online, how much more propylene do you think LatAm can actually absorb and at what point would we have to start exporting to Asia or Europe which are then the much lower net back? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : No, I suspect that some of it would need to go to Europe which would be the next logical destination. Europe over time will probably need propylene. So, I think Europe seems logical. Of course, Asia, they have large need. And for them it's also make versus buy. Because in Asia you see a lot of new PDH capacity coming. So, we will have to watch that. The thing we have to see is how much propylene export capacity there really is in the U.S. and whether somebody would build more or not? And I don't have a fresh view on that. Jonas Oxgaard : Enterprise talk yesterday about how they can repurpose on their propane to propylene. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Okay. Well, I would think Europe would be more logical destination as a next to South America. Jonas Oxgaard : Yeah move on. Once South America is full clearly, and I just how \u2013 if they can absorb anything else. It makes perfect sense. Thanks guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Robert Andrew Koort : Thank you. Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Good morning, Bob. Robert Andrew Koort : Bob, we have seen, I guess, there was some ebbs and flows. Sasol may be pushed out their plant for a bit and now we've heard Total, Shell, SABIC, Exxon, maybe all mobilizing the build capacity. So, just curious do you have any more appetite for a greenfield and is there any option to maybe do it in a joint venture arrangement with either Middle East partner or maybe a North American partner? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Bob, you know what we see is that, in a more moderate oil price environment, over the medium or longer-term, and ethane trading somewhat above its fuel value, construction cost being what they are in the Gulf coast, greenfield is challenging, we think, to earn reasonable returns and perhaps our return aspirations are a lot higher. I don't know. But so far we would like to see how the rest of the decade plays out before we take a really firm view on that. In the meantime, we still got some debottleneck capacity that we can do. As I mentioned, we have one more we can do a Channelview. We are focused on PO/TBA and polyethylene. So we have pretty healthy slate of growth projects and capital projects ahead of us. And I'd like to see us execute those really well before we think about new greenfield plant. Robert Andrew Koort : And can I ask on the \u2013 you are talking about these new investments, new capital as you say it's PO and polyethylene. Is this given after margins have come in a little bit in the industry. Does this decelerate your share repurchase activity or can you give us some sense on what you think your buyback pace and balance sheet looks like over the next 24 months? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : So we've announced this 18 month and this next 10% buyback over 18 months. And so we are on pace to be able to fund that. Beyond that, we'll just kind of have to see how markets develop and what \u2013 our view is that we have sufficient cash flow to do to continue to supplement our share repurchase and so one and still engage in these growth projects. So, Thomas, I don't know if you have anything else to add to that? Thomas Aebischer : No. We have been able really given prospectively information or estimates about share buybacks. As we have said, we have a new program approved for 10%. We have more than $5 billion of liquidity if you look at the committed credit facility as well. So, we are in a good situation to execute on the progressive dividend and on the share buyback program. Robert Andrew Koort : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question would come from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Maybe if I can follow up on Bob's question. Share repurchase for Lyondell right now is a good idea maybe you are above 1 times levered. And CFO talked about your borrowing capacity. Would you be willing to move up to 1.5 times leverage or 2 times leverage or maybe another way of asking it is, under what circumstances would share repurchase not be a feasible option for you exclusive of acquisition opportunities. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Jeff, I'll start and then I will turn it over to Thomas. Generally speaking, our aim is to create value for shareholders. So the range of options you outlined, we evaluate those. At the end of the day, that's what we are focused on near-term, midterm, long-term. So, Thomas, I don't know if you want to add more to that? Thomas Aebischer : No, we are evaluating the share repurchase, obviously, with other options. But, answering your question about how far would we go with respect to leverage. What's very important to us is to maintain a healthy balance sheet and we are focusing on the BBB+ rating as mentioned in my initial outlines and that is clearly a very much a guiding benchmark to maintain that BBB+ rating through the cycle. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel : Okay, Thank you, Jeff. If there are no other questions then I will close with a few comments. First of all in the near-term we see markets being very strong. We see solid demand growth year-over-year. Planned maintenance and some unplanned outages in the industry and our planned maintenance have kept supply moderate. So we see pretty balanced markets. When we think about the cycle with some delays in new capacity, operating rates were not going to dip much below 90% on paper in the past. And as we see, some of these delays and even some of the CTO project in Asia being canceled, there's a higher likelihood that 2018 effective operating rates may not dip below 90%. So, our view is that we are very constructive on markets near-term, medium term. We are continuing to deliver strong earnings, last 12 months at a pace of nearly $10 per share. Excluding LCM, we have a strong dividend. We are engaged in our fourth 10% share buyback program. So by virtue of those two things we are returning significant cash back to our shareholders. Our focus remains very consistent, safe, reliable, cost efficient cost operations. We're going to finish the Corpus turnaround and debottleneck it by the end of Q3. We're want to continue to execute on the other turnarounds that we have. I think what all of this planned maintenance activity sets us up for is a strong 2017. We have very little turnaround activity in 2017. And so I think that positions us well for next year. And we're starting to build out our growth project portfolio with our polyethylene project in 2019 and potentially the PO/TBA project in 2020. So we're continuing to advance those growth projects as well. So we look forward to updating all of you on those items at our next call. So thanks again for your interest in our company. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to highlight, the comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of LCM inventory adjustments. That being said, I'll turn the call over to, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thanks, Doug. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide 4, and review the highlights from the third quarter. Our third quarter diluted earnings were $2.31 per share with EBITDA of $1.6 billion. Overall, third quarter business trends developed as we expected. During the quarter, olefin chain margins continue to be healthy, most notably, excellent results in our European Olefins & Polyolefins business, demonstrated the strength of our global portfolio. Despite the significant planned maintenance and the Americas, the combined Olefins & Polyolefins results were $1.3 billion, relatively unchanged versus second quarter. While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was planned downtime in these operations and unplanned downtime in our Refining segment. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of third quarter loss production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $285 million. Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. Our results here today have remained steady despite performing an unusually high amount of maintenance. Thomas, will discuss our financial highlights for the third quarter. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you both, and good morning from Rotterdam. On slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined Olefins & Polyolefins continue to generate good quarter results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA and $5.3 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment third quarter EBITDA was approximately $300 million, and $1.3 billion over the last 12 months. Utility supply and other operational upsets resulted in a loss at the refinery. Technology continued to perform well at last 12 month's pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and refinery upsets, year-to-date earnings are near a $7 billion annual pace. Please return to slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations. We utilized $1.2 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and growth capital investments were approximately $590 million during the third quarter with a significant portion of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion, and the turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility. During the third quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $420 million to end with a balance of $2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, quarterly cash generation and spending trends were relatively similar to the third quarter pace. The $2.1 billion ending cash and liquid investments balance remains above our minimum requirement. Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. I will just mention a couple. First, our last 12 month's cash flow was approximately $5 billion with free cash flow off the CapEx of approximately $3 billion. With respect to share repurchases during the third quarter, we purchased 10.3 million shares, bringing the year-to-date purchases to 7%. 2016 CapEx spending is trending above our forecast of $2.1 billion. With that, thank you for your attention, I will turn the call back to Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 9, and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, third quarter EBITDA was $682 million, a decline of $72 million versus the second quarter. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results increased by approximately $15 million. Ethylene prices and margins increased, while scheduled plant maintenance at our Corpus Christi and Morris sites negatively impacted the quarter. Olefin operating rates averaged approximately 70%. Excluding the scheduled maintenance, quarterly operating rates were approximately 95%. Ethylene production from ethane was approximately 70%, and about 87% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, results declined by $70 million. Results were driven by lower margins, partially offset by increased sales volumes. Polyethylene price spreads declined approximately $0.04 per pound, while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.09 per pound. Polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes increased by approximately 6% and 13%, respectively. At third quarter industry benchmark margins, the net value of lost production related to our planned turnarounds is estimated to be about $205 million. Thus far during the fourth quarter, Olefins & Polyolefins Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. The Corpus Christi ethylene facility is currently being commissioned after the turnaround and expansion. We expect the plant to be operating at the expanded capacity during the month of November. Let's turn to slide 10, and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, underlying EBITDA was $584 million, a $48 million increase over the second quarter. Despite a decline in polyolefins and equity income, overall results represent a record quarter. The quarter benefited by $11 million from the restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of Australian polypropylene assets. Olefins' results improved by approximately $95 million as feedstock costs decreased coupled with olefin price increases. Additionally, volumes for the third quarter increased in the absence of second quarter planned maintenance. Advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $40 million over naphtha. Polyolefins' results declined $25 million, driven by reduced polyethylene margins. Equity income declined by $29 million due to scheduled maintenance at joint venture facilities. During the early weeks of the fourth quarter, naphtha feedstock prices have increased, while underlying industry conditions remain relatively unchanged. Planned maintenance is underway at one of our ethylene crackers in Wesseling, Germany. The value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $25 million. Now, please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $304 million, a decline of $65 million versus the second quarter. Planned maintenance impacted the quarter by approximately $15 million. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $15 million as a result of lower derivative margins following propylene price increases. Intermediate chemicals declined approximately $60 million versus the second quarter. Styrene margins were the primary factor with a decrease of approximately $0.03 per pound. Oxyfuels' results were relatively unchanged with increased volume offsetting lower margins. Thus far in the fourth quarter, I&D industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the third quarter. However, it is typical for oxyfuel margins to weaken during the fall and winter months. Let's move to slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was a loss of $10 million. Crude throughput averaged 209,000 barrels per day as throughput and yields were impacted by operating disruptions. The industry Maya 2-1-1 spread decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $19 per barrel in the quarter. Based on the third quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity due to operational issues is estimated to be approximately $65 million. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with third quarter EBITDA of $45 million. Let me summarize our results with slide 13. Overall earnings and cash generation continued to be satisfactory, and industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. Olefins & Polyolefins conditions remained quite tight as evidenced by increased prices in U.S. ethylene and polypropylene chains. Although our O&P results were impacted by a heavy planned maintenance schedule, they remain consistent with the prior quarter. In the I&D segment, increased raw material prices impacted PO derivative and styrene results, while planned maintenance impacted the ethylene derivatives. These events are temporary and within the normal quarter-to-quarter variability. During the fourth quarter, we anticipate some typical seasonal slowing in the ethylene chain in oxyfuels and Refining. However, reduced scheduled maintenance, completion of the ethylene expansion at Corpus Christi and improved Refining operations should provide a positive counterbalance. While there will be some planned maintenance within the system, the current testament of the lost production value is approximately $75 million to $100 million, well-below the maintenance impact of second and third quarters. I expect that there are some questions regarding the refinery status within our portfolio. Let me address that now. The company currently is exploring its options relating to our Houston Refinery, which is the core asset of the Refining operating segment. As the company has stated in the past, we believe the Houston Refinery may be more valuable to others. We've engaged an investment bank to assist us in a process to explore our alternatives. We believe this refinery is a very unique asset, and to that end will only consider a sale if it is in the best interest of all stakeholders. Any sale of the Houston Refinery would be subject to the approval of our Supervisory Board, and assuming such approval is obtained, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions would also apply. No decisions by our Supervisory Board with respect to the sale have been made at this time, and any further comments on a potential transaction would be speculative in nature. Before I finish with closing remarks, I'd like to spend a few minutes looking at the near to medium-term outlook for supply and demand, particularly within the ethylene chain for both LyondellBasell and the global industry. Turning to slide 14, I'd like to outline how LyondellBasell's heavy maintenance schedule for 2016 compares to our relatively light plans for 2017. We typically have turnarounds at only two crackers in a given year. However, during 2016, we had four major cracker turnarounds and significant derivative turnaround activity. We also expanded the capacity of our Corpus Christi cracker by 800 million pounds. With this hard work completed during 2016, we have no cracker turnarounds scheduled during 2017. At the refinery, planned and unplanned maintenance helped crude runs to a level that is projected to be 40,000 barrels per day below our 2017 planned throughput availability. And that behind the increased earnings power associated with these volumes is pretty straightforward, and we have provided 2016 benchmark margins for each of these businesses. The additional throughput has the potential to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the LyondellBasell bottom line during 2017. As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, the combination of delayed and capacity additions and continuing growth in global demand is improving our views on the market. Let's turn the slide 15, and view the drivers of O&P demand. Within our polyethylene and polypropylene businesses, approximately two-thirds of the demand for our polyolefins comes from non-durable end users that are largely driven by population growth and a rising standard of living around the world. The large population's GDP growth and consumption trends seen in China, India and other emerging economies will continue to drive these markets towards higher consumption. We believe that polyethylene and polypropylene can maintain the 4% to 5% demand growth that we have seen for these products over the past 25 years. Given this demand growth, the operating rate question turns to the capacity additions that we have outlined on slide 16. Crackers require billions of dollars of investments with long engineering and construction lead times. This enables good visibility of olefin capacity additions for the coming five years. Earlier this year, we combined the IHS supply and demand outlook with a 4% forecast for planned and unplanned maintenance downtime to arrive at the effective operating rate illustrated by the green dotted line on the right side of slide 16. Operating rates were forecast to remain strong with only a brief decline in 2018, below the 90% to 94% range shaded in blue. This is a range where we would consider markets to be in a transition between loose and tight conditions. Over the past several months, consultants have upgraded their views on capacity additions to reflect their increasing likelihood of project delays and cancellations. The result is a 6 billion pound reduction in an available capacity for 2018 that elevates global operating rates by about 1.5%. We also reviewed recent operating history on the left side of the slide 16, which shows that downtime from planned and unplanned maintenance averaged 6%, 2% higher than our previous 4% estimate. The net result of these updates is shown as the black line on the right. A historical shape for this operating rate curve shows good correlation with profitability that the global industry has seen since late 2014, when prices and margins began to surpass the cost of the marginal producer. While we likely see reductions from current operating rates as new capacity comes online, it appears that these reductions in operating rates will be shorter and less severe than previous estimates. On slide 17, global balances are quantified in terms of the annual capacity of a world-scale cracker using ethane feedstocks to produce 3 billion pounds of ethylene. The three time periods provide perspective of the oncoming shale-based capacity additions relative to global demand growth, and earlier capacity additions in other parts of the world. As seen in the left chart from 2007 to 2011, global capacity additions exceeded demand by approximately eight crackers. Most of these new crackers were built in the Middle East to leverage advantaged feedstocks, and these crackers ran at maximum rates, even through the 2009 recession. Over the past five years, world demand has outpaced capacity additions by an amount equivalent to three crackers, primarily due to growing demand in China. As a result, global markets have tightened. Even with the eight cracker equivalents forecast to come online in the United States by 2021, the forecast is relatively balanced over the next five years. In summary, delays and cancellations coupled with continued population-driven demand create a positive outlook for the coming years. Our team has completed several major turnarounds and we head into 2017 very well-positioned. The view of the next several years is indicating better operating rates and conditions than we forecasted earlier this year. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day on April 5 in New York. Please hold that date on your calendars, and we look forward to seeing you there. Thank you, and now we're pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I was hoping you could provide, maybe your view on \u2013 your expectations for ethylene price discussions ahead of what sounds like there's going to be three or maybe even four new crackers next year. In the past when you've seen supply come into market, maybe in some your other regions; how does that impacts kind of your contract discussion with your customers? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Good morning, Ryan. In the case of ethylene, generally price discussions are not quarterly or annual; they're more longer-term sort of contracts. So it's really, the discussions have been about how our customers might bridge supplies. They're adding derivative capacity that has a different timing than crackers, and some are pure merchant buyers, who need to continue to buy. So our pricing discussions tend to be more longer-term rather than quarter-to-quarter in nature. Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then do you think that there'll be any additional \u2013 or do you think the lag between when the derivatives and the crackers come up this cycle will be materially different from kind of a normal six-month period? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, I think next year, it seems that some derivatives may come earlier than the cracker start-ups, but ultimately that'll catch up in 2018. So if there is a lag, it's a six to nine month sort of lag. Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. In propylene oxide business, would you describe the decline in margins as temporary, and do you expect to pass through higher costs of propylene in the near-term? Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Hi, Aleks, this is Doug. Yeah, I think what you're seeing in propylene oxide is you saw propylene price movements; and it takes a little bit of time to move that through particularly the derivatives. So we'll see how propylene responds this quarter. But I think it's temporary, and as we've said in the past, propylene oxide business tends to be a very stable business, overall. But you are going to see quarter-on-quarter movements, particularly with raw material changes like that. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks, Doug. And in O&P your year-over-year, the benchmark integrated margin for polyethylene is quite a bit lower, and yet your EBITDA is higher. How will you explain this? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So first of all, I think our results, Aleksey, in Europe are reflective of strong global operating rates. We talked about that earlier. That markets are pretty well-balanced, and for us, our sense is that, the operating rates in the region have increased significantly, demand is growing at 1% to 2% per annum, there's really not a lot of capacity growth. In our case we have \u2013 we're running at pretty high utilization rates. So that in part could explain the difference versus benchmarks as just \u2013 with the exception of planned maintenance, we've been running pretty full in Europe. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you so much. Our next question is from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Bob, just looking at polyethylene margins into 2017, as you know they're bringing on capacity either new or previously shutdown. Do you expect and how do you expect ethylene markets to trend, I guess likely down over the course of the year? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Of ethylene or polyethylene, David? David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Of polyethylene. Polyethylene. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Well, I think we'll have to kind of see how demand develops and how oil prices develop, and so on. But certainly, Asian demand is growing to the extent that new capacity likely will be exported. So our sense is that, certainly through the first half of the year there's not a lot of new capacity, more of the new capacity which is in the second half of next year. So we'll just have to see how that develops. But our sense is that Asian demand is growing at a pace where that production will be needed overseas. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And Bob, just on M&A and buybacks going forward, how is the M&A pipeline, and how are you thinking about \u2013 I think you said you've purchased about $15 billion of stock since 2013. Is the focus weight now a little more towards M&A going forward? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, no. Our cash deployment hierarchy that we've shown you in our prior IR materials is relatively unchanged. What I would say is that, in terms of M&A, I think we're very clear about who we are. We know what we do well. We understand, I think what it takes to safely, reliably and cost-effectively run large-scale assets that are kind of in our core businesses. So I think we deploy capital pretty well. So our intention is to patiently look for opportunities to apply these strengths and create more shareholder value. So to the extent that those opportunities present themselves, and we can create meaningful value applying those strengths, then we would certainly consider those. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Thank you. You know, polypropylene spreads declined in the quarter. Is that related to supply/demand? Or is there any substitution going on among different plastics? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, I think part of that was propylene movements during the quarter. The other part of that, P.J., was that there were some imports early in the quarter that came in, but I think those were somewhat sporadic. It's more about propylene movements in the month. We still see pretty high operating rates in PP, here in the U.S. with really not a lot of new incremental supply in the near-term. Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV : And P.J., when you look across multiple quarters, you'll see that our results differ a little bit from the benchmarks. For example, in the second quarter, while the benchmark was off by, I think $0.05 to $0.07, we were down at $0.02. So a little bit of it's probably catch-up from that type of movement too. But I think when you look across year-to-year, we're actually well ahead of the benchmark. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then in polyethylene, polyethylene margins declined while ethylene margins went up. So do you think there is any rebalancing of margins between the Olefins & Polyolefins meaning that margin is going back to olefins now? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I think, P.J., what you're seeing is, you saw the tightness in ethylene price moved up, while polyethylene was sort of moving sideways at that point in time. As turnarounds complete, we may see a little bit of loosening on the ethylene side. So I think it'll just balance across, I think you're looking at kind of noise quarter-to-quarter, and of course, the goal is, we want to capture the chain margin. Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Exactly. And, P.J., if you remember that the ethylene prices are much more regional, while polyethylene prices are more global in terms of how they're set. So spot price movements and the spot market is very thin in ethylene, so that has some influence. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you for that. Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, good morning, fellows. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The chart, the updated forecast on page 16, pretty meaningful change. Is your confidence in that great enough that that would change some of the ways you'd think about investing in the business, either building new capacity ahead of with a tighter outlook, maybe buying back more shares or increasing the dividend? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, our investment plans haven't significantly changed. We've tilted to a bit more growth capital, and as you know, we announced at the last call that we would build a new polyethylene plant. So that project is now underway, and so we're systematically evaluating other opportunities as we look further out into the cycle. But no, no material change. I think it's just a reflection of the reality of some of the delays that have been announced, and frankly ramp up schedules of these very large plants. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then a follow-on question kind of on that same topic with the change in outlook there. Does that materially impact your outlook for NGL pricing in North America? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I think it certainly provides for more ethane in the near-term and maybe even more rejection until some of these crackers come up. In the meantime, if oil prices incrementally rise, that should provide more ethane supply. Our view, Duffy, on ethane is relatively unchanged over the medium and long-term. We think that there's enough resource here. Ultimately ethane has traded recently and will trade above its fuel value. Historical average has been somewhere around $0.07 per gallon. We think that's reasonable and that still affords the U.S., a reasonable advantage, vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world. So relatively unchanged. I think as some of these crackers start up, there could be a bit more volatility, but over the long-term, we think there's enough ethane here. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. Could you discuss the impact of coal-to-olefins projects in China in terms of your global supply/demand view of ethylene? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes, James. Some of those projects have already been canceled, and I think that's partly what's reflected in the IHS numbers. Because of the availability of water, environmental impacts, capital costs; so we continue to watch that. Our sense is that more could be delayed, and that the capital costs could be prohibitive as well. So that certainly adds to the operating rate increase in the latter years that we show in our materials. James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. And looking at Europe, the spreads of polypropylene over propylene have narrowed considerably of late. Do you think that's a trend that continues in 2017? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No. I think that's just kind of in-quarter market volatility. If you kind of step back and look at operating rates in Europe, they are increasing. As I mentioned earlier, there's really no new capacity coming. And if you think about in an environment where we have a relatively weaker euro compared to a couple of years ago, our customers are finding it more \u2013 they're more able to export competitively as well. So we see a pretty balanced market in Europe with a global strong operating rate overlay. James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line now open. You may ask your question. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Bob, if we made the assumption that you were successful in selling the refinery, could you help us a bit on what the tax leakage would be? And then what the use of proceeds would be? And how fast you would look to use the proceeds? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. Well, good morning, Vincent. I think it's little early to speak to the tax leakage, but I think, the operative word is if. And let's say if we were to sell the refinery, I think our aim is to replace the earnings over time. First of all, you know that would have a increasing capital program where we're looking to grow organically; where we'll also thoughtfully and patiently evaluate other growth opportunities. Our aim over time, if you think about cash deployment and some balance sheet is to have a strong, stable dividend, a strong rating through the cycle. And so we'll kind of balance all of that, but our aim is to replace those earnings. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And it doesn't sound like the means to do that would be by reducing the share count? Or did I misread you? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : That wouldn't be the highest priority. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Bob, you talked about the delays you've seen in crackers, and I guess associated derivative plants, which is obviously positive for margins next year. But is there impact on you? I mean, is your polyethylene plants going to be affected by equipment and labor tightness that's leading to the delay in cracker construction? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No. I think our polyethylene plant that we're just starting now on construction, it's phased such that the things that we need are \u2013 those things are already completed in many of these plants. So I think, we're well-positioned, we're still aiming for the middle of 2019 for start-up of that polyethylene plant. And I think, we've really planned well for it. So we should be on schedule. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And then you said, you had about $205 million in outages in O&P Americas. I think your original estimate was $135 million. Was it primarily volume that accounted for that difference? Or was it that, when you do have to go in the marketed and buy spot ethylene that have surged much more than you expected? Just wondering if you could kind of give a variance versus your original expectations? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. That's a increase in the delay in the Corpus Christi expansion, and then frankly, just higher margins during the quarter. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Bob, one of the things that we saw over the last couple of months was a big spike up in Asian coal pricing, Chinese coal pricing. Now, obviously you guys produce ethylene, methanol, acetate, a bunch of these products that in some production degree rely on coal as the feedstock. So could you give us a sense, looking at a variety of these products, where coal may potentially have an impact on pricing? Where it may not? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think coal pricing is still, if you think about marginal cost of production of ethylene or olefins in China, coal pricing is still relatively low. I still, think MTO is probably more of the price header than CTO, at these oil price levels. As oil price rises, if it were to rise materially, then maybe naphtha would kind of crossover in a lower gas price environment. But I think coal, it's really more, as I said earlier, about the capital costs and the environmental impacts of coal-based chemical production that I think will continue to pressure new additions. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Understood. Understood. Now, as a separate sort of topic. On the styrene side of things. Obviously, we saw some slippage in pricing, margins seem to have been holding up quite well over the last couple of quarters. And recently, there was some price slippage, some margin slippage. Should we extrapolate that trend? Or is it just a one-off and you see things sort of decently balanced in the styrene market going forward? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, this time we've come off of pretty high levels. So if you look back historically, still where we are today, styrene margins are relatively healthy. If we can say that with styrene. So I still think that in the near term markets look to be reasonably balanced. There will be some new capacity coming next year and the year after, which will incrementally add a bit more styrene into the market. But we're relatively constructive about styrene in the coming, let's say 6 to 9 months; difficult to see beyond that, frankly. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Fantastic. Thank you, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from (39:00). Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Unknown Speaker : Hi, there. I wanted to ask both advantaged cracking in Europe. I see that in Q3 last year, it was about 65%, and it's dropped to 52% in this quarter. Is that a trend that you expect to continue that naphtha cracking actually has become more profitable? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No. I think, it's just reflective of butane prices over there, this summer compared to last summer. So it's more about sort of individual feedstock prices. We still think that there's \u2013 LPG market should be pretty favorable for us and we also cracked some heavy condensates over there. So not a trend, I don't think. Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV : And around 50% has been our typical advantaged feed level. So I'd say, it was just a typical quarter from that standpoint. Unknown Speaker : And the second question, when does your cracker in Wesseling start up in Europe? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : It will start up later this month. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Morning, guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good Morning. Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I have a two-parter if you don't mind related, but \u2013 so returning to the coal prices in China, it makes carbide PVC less competitive. So my first part here is, what kind of impact do you think that could have for global utilization? And then the follow-up to that is, it also makes Chinese chlorine less competitive, and thus U.S. caustic prices are rising. That in turn leading to the higher ethylene prices we're seeing in the U.S. So do you think that trend will continue or do you have an opinion about this at all? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. No. I think that's a very astute observation, certainly that will allow the U.S. PVC producers to export more competitively. And frankly, I think that bodes well for the ethylene market here, because generally when you think about incremental sales of ethylene and then the stock market, that's kind of the incremental decision that gets made in our market here is incremental exports of EDC or PDC. And I think that should be net positive for U.S. ethylene going into Q4 and Q1. Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. And on the global utilization, do you think ethylene is helped by this coal price in China? Or is that just a blip? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No, I think it's helped. I think it's helped, and I think it'll have an impact longer term on new capacity, and what's being considered. Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That makes sense. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you so much. Our next question is from John Roberts of UBS. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. I think the refinery has been non-core for a long time. Why would now be the right time to be having divestment discussions on the refinery? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : John, it's also \u2013 it's kind of a factor of opportunities and interest in the market. So I think, it's as simple as that. But again, I want to emphasize that, we see this as being, while it may be non-core, it's still a very high-quality asset in a great location. Very complex in terms of the crude slate it can process. So we're very value minded in our consideration here. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just following up on your comments a little earlier there, Bob, on your outlook for ethane supply, and pricing versus fuel value. Can you provide your outlook for propane in a similar context? And do you expect any meaningful shifting in your U.S. cracker feedstock mix over the next one to two years? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, I think first of all, propane and ethane will continue to compete for the feed slate in the U.S. We're continuing to invest in flexibility incrementally, but it's something that I have the team focused on, but I do think longer-term difficult to predict how these various feedstocks will develop and flexibility will be important. So we view that as very strategically important to us. I think, propane is going to be abundant here, as wet gaskets develop, there's a lot of export capacity. When you think about export costs, local consumption will still be favored, so there will be a good, healthy interplay between ethane and propane and the industry in terms of the existing cracker fleet, has a reasonable amount of flexibility, which should help to balance any kind of run up in ethane prices. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just briefly on that, what would you \u2013 how would you characterize that feedstock mix right now? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : For us, or the industry? Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : For you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : For us, I think, we mentioned earlier that about 87% or so of our ethylene was from NGLs, and about 70% was from ethane. So we're generally in the same ballpark today. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners : Yes, good morning, gentleman. Bob, many years ago when Lyondell gained control of the refinery and integrated the asset; one of the benefits that was touted was increased flexibility to move products across the fence or over the fence. If you were to pull the trigger and divest the asset at some point; can you talk about your ability to preserve that flexibility? And maybe update us on what you're doing typically between the refinery and petrochemicals? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Sure. Well, good morning, Kevin, and welcome back. We have connectivity between our Channelview site and the refinery, and then modestly with a couple of the other sites, but mainly between Channelview. First of all, we transfer various products at market, so to the extent that there's pipeline connectivity and the Channelview site is the most logical sort of partner, then I think sort of the economic impact is really negligible. And that connectivity and the benefits of that connectivity should continue whether we own it or somebody else owns it. So we review that very carefully, and we don't see any impact. Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners : That's good to know. And then as a brief follow-up, sticking with the refinery. Were you running at full rates in October? And do you have any thoughts on the explosion of the Colonial gasoline pipeline overnight that seems to be impacting gasoline markets at least here in the Northeast? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So in terms of rates at the refinery in October, we were not really at full rates. In Q3, we had a sudden power disruption, which was sort of an external impact. And generally, what happens with those is, you see kind of a knock-on effect. When you suddenly lose power, it creates a dislocation. It's similar to crackers as well. And so, we've kind of discovered some of that after we recovered from the power outage. And I think we're just about there now. In fact today, the refinery is running at 250-plus thousand barrels a day. So \u2013 but we've been sort of ramping up, and we expect to stay there, frankly. In terms of the Colonial Pipeline, it's still pretty fresh news. As of this morning we don't expect any material impact to our refinery or the operations there. Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners : Thank you very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from just Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. There's of course the first wave of new ethylene crackers, Dow, ExxonMobil, Phillips and Occidental. And they should all be on stream by the middle of 2018. But then there's a second wave, and the second wave is Formosa and Shintech and Sasol and Indorama. Do you think a meaningful part of the second-wave capacity comes on in 2018? Do you think it's at least 50%? Or do you think it's really deferred into 2019? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think some of those producers have announced new timelines. Difficult to say whether the others would be delayed or not, but I can tell you from our own experience of some of these debottlenecks, that we've done these projects in a very congested window, and they're very large, complex plants. So it wouldn't surprise me, but I don't have any other information beyond what's in the press. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then secondly, from the tenor of your comments earlier in the call, is it the case that your capital expenditures from say 2017 through 2020 may be more in a $2 billion to $2.5 billion band, rather than closer to $2 billion? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. I think we've indicated that in past calls as well. But Jeff, that's right. And we're with our polyethylene plant, that's already underway, and then, if we decide to go ahead sometime mid of next year on the PO/TBA project, those two are pretty large projects that will meaningfully add to our earnings power in the future. So we would step up to above the $2 billion range. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Hi, good morning. Bob, I appreciated the slide on the maintenance impact in 2016, and the much lesser impact in 2017. And you went through ethylene, and ethylene derivatives and Refining. I'm just curious in terms of I&D, I&D had been a really good segment for the company, very consistently above $1.5 billion EBITDA since 2012. Obviously, 2016 slipping somewhat on a margin side. Well, how should we think about the outlook for the I&D segment? And to get back to that $1.5 billion plus EBITDA? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I&D is still a very strong and somewhat stable contributor to our earnings. Frank, I think, we compare and contrast last year and this year, there's a few big drivers. First of all, in the oxyfuels area, our earnings are lower, long gasoline market, and then you see that in Refining as well. So that impacts oxyfuels. Octane was a little more balanced rather than tight, so ramping-ins (51:12) were lower. And butane in the U.S. was higher priced compared to fuel value or oil price. So those all kind of contributed to lower margins in oxyfuels. We do think that, those certainly can reverse themselves next year. I would say last year, butane trading at 35% of oil price in the summer, that was probably unusually low. And this year we've been on the high side. So I think that's one contributor. The other is methanol has come off some. Methanol was very different last year, new capacity coming. We've already paid for our restart. So for us, our methanol asset is much more opportunistic, and a play on still cheap natural gas in the U.S. And then lastly, styrene margins are good, but they've come off of a really great year last year. So that's how I would kind of compare and contrast 2015 and 2016. Oxyfuels, methanol, and styrene, and the oxyfuels being probably the most dominant of the three in terms of the change. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. That's very helpful. And then, not really much in the way, a delta, in the way of plant turnarounds or anything like that 2017 versus 2016 in the segment. Is that correct? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No, not really. No. Most of that is in the ethylene, in the O&P segments. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Terrific. Thanks so much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to understand, I guess, some of the impacts in Q3 in O&P Americas, the $680 million or so in EBITDA. It looks like you were impacted on the maintenance line around $180 million or so. So if we take that out, we would be closer up to $860 million. So if we kept margins kind of where they were, is that a fair run rate going forward? And what would be kind of offsets to that? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I think, first of all, Arun, the \u2013 if you think about the impacts in the Olefins & Polyolefins in the Americas, we have two big crackers down. Right, we had Corpus still down through the quarter as we're completing our de-bottleneck, and we had our Morris site, which includes derivatives, because we don't have ethylene connectivity or the ability the store ethylene up there. So when we do a cracker turnaround, we basically shut down that equivalent amount of polyethylene. So that has kind of an integrated impact. The two together in the high $100 million, about $200 million, let's call it, range. So yeah, I think, you could add that back. On your question about run rate, I think you got to go back and look at, as you go forward, adjust that for whatever the market does in terms of margin evolution. But certainly, that's all planned maintenance, that was not unplanned. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then just looking at Europe, similar question, I guess. You really reached a new level of earnings power in that business. Maybe, you can just give us your view on how you'd characterize your outlook there. If oils kind of stays in this similar kind of $55 to $60 level, do you expect naphtha margins to get compressed? Or can you offset with increased condensate and other advantaged fuels? And so do you expect to still keep earning in a similar range? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think, Arun, in Europe, the earnings power is really related to, first of all, global operating rates being relatively strong, and regional operating rates have been ramping up in the last two, three years. We've been running full since about 2013, late-2013, early 2014. So my sense is that, with demand still growing 1%, 2% a year, no new capacity and euro is now below $1.10. So our customers can export a little more competitively, and imports probably don't look as attractive to people from outside of Europe. So all of that seems to me creates a very balanced market, and what's going to be important is for us to operate really well. And this year we have. Other than one turnaround in France early in the year that went a bit long, we've operated well, which has contributed to a really strong third quarter. We had strong volumes in Q3. So I think Europe is going to continue to be pretty strong. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is through Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on your near-term PE outlook for the U.S., I think there's been some reports of potential contract price drops for November. What are your thoughts in that area? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, there's always seasonality in these businesses, and it is contract season in November/December for the next year. So we'll kind of have to watch and see how things develop. Our sense is that \u2013 and I think the publications have reflected, the prior $0.05 increase in Q3. And so, I think, we'll have to see how that develops. But typically we see volumes come down a little bit seasonally in Q4, and there's a bit of competitive activity around contracts. So that's kind of normal. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Great. Thanks. And then, given your improving view on ethylene going forward, would you look to maybe ramp up the potential Channelview expansion? Or are you looking more to balance your Olefins & Polyolefin exposure in the Americas? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, so implementation of those de-bottlenecks is also dependent on shutdown timing, and kind of how we layer in those capital projects. But for now, I want us to stay focused on executing these polyethylene projects that we've started, flawlessly get it on, on time. And I think in due course, we will do those the de-bottlenecks at Channelview. And we may have the ability to bring those forward, but for now, we're going to stay with our plan through 2019 certainly to get this polyethylene project moving. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I appreciate it. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nils Wallin at CLSA. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think that there is a fair amount of visibility on the capacity adds in 2017 through 2019 timeframe. But after that, there is limited capacity coming out in 2020 and 2021 as far as the consultants are concerned. So it would seem like this is the time now to start thinking about the capacity additions. How are you guys thinking about potential capital projects in the next decade? And are you hearing anything outside of the U.S., perhaps in Asia, where margins are now sort of at reinvestment economics? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'll speak for ourselves; can't speak for others. But what I think about, Nils is, in terms of U.S., we need to first take a view on oil-to-gas. And again, as I said earlier in the call, I think the U.S. will have advantage, given the abundance of the resource we have here in natural gas, and fracking and so on. But in a lower oil price environment and incrementally higher capital costs, to me it's not obvious that we would invest in a new cracker facility here in the U.S. in post 2020. So first and foremost, we've got to take a view on oil-to-gas ratio, and even if capital costs come up some compared to this really sort of heightened period we've just been through, we're still at a level where returns, to me, they look marginal when you look at a $50 oil price, and let's say $3 gas, and in fact paying some premium over a fuel value, which I think it's reasonable to assume. So I think all that still needs to be better understood before we as the company would take a view on the new project in the next decade. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : That's very helpful. And just on your, the revision to your operating rate outlook, does that materially change your view on profitability? I mean, we know that there's pretty good rules of thumb around oil, but if your operating rates go up 300 basis points, 400 basis points globally, do you have a view of what that could do to global profitability on a cent per pound basis? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I think \u2013 what we're trying to indicate is that, the cycle that's been talked about for the past year or two may be more muted than was expected, as we learn more about the timing of expansions and the actual operability of assets around the world. And so with higher operating rates, Nils, we would expect that there is potential for higher margins. I won't give you a specific number today, but I would say that directionally, we expect markets to be firmer than we did a year ago. And the cycles to not be as deep or as broad as we might have thought a year ago. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thanks very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. At this time we don't have any questions on the phone. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. So I'd like to just close with a few comments before we conclude our call. First of all, I think we had a solid quarter despite two cracker turnarounds in the U.S. and some I&D planned maintenance. I think we're really well positioned to finish the year strong. Our focus is to get the Corpus Christi cracker started up here in November, and realize the benefit of 800 million pounds of more capacity and to have that cracker back online. With a very large planned maintenance here this year, next year, as we've outlined in our materials, we're going to meaningfully add to our volume, and I think we're really well-positioned for what we think will be very good markets next year as project timing has been pushed out. And longer-term as we outline, we think that operating rates for ethylene globally probably shifted up a bit from our prior estimates, given ramp up time and start-up of new projects. So I think we'll continue to be well-positioned both near-term and long-term. So we look forward to updating you on our full earnings in February. And thanks as always for your interest in our company. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At the request of LyondellBasell this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Douglas Pike : Thank you. Welcome to LyondellBasell's fourth quarter 2016 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO; and Thomas Aebischer, our CFO. Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Now for more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com. And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time today until 11 PM Eastern Time on March 3 by calling 866-467-2412 in the United States, and 203-369-1448 outside the United States. And the passcode for both numbers is 2526. And during today's call, we'll focus on fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance, the current environment, and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the non-cash, lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the fourth quarter we recognized LCM charges totaling $29 million. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of these LCM inventory charges. With that being said, now I'll turn the call over to, Bob. Bhavesh Patel : Thanks Doug. Good morning to all and thank you for taking the time to join our fourth quarter earnings call. 2016 was another dynamic year for our industry as we saw our crude oil prices were down from the lows of the first quarter and the continuation of relatively type balances in global chemical and polymer markets. For LyondellBasell, it was very busy year within our company as we scheduled and completed twice as many ethylene cracker maintenance turnarounds than we could have in a typical year along with several other growth and reliability projects. Despite these challenges, our company continued to deliver strong results. Let's take a look at Slide 4 and reflect on a few of the more notable financial accomplishments for 2016. Performance continued to be strong with $6.6 billion in EBITDA that resulted in earnings of $9.20 per share and $5.6 billion of cash from operations. We invested $2.2 billion of this cash in our growth and maintenance capital program, while over $4 billion was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our strong dividend yield placed us in the top 10% of the S&P 500 index and our share repurchase program relative to our market capitalization placed us in the top 5% of all S&P 500 companies. Despite the high capital intensity of our industry, the end result is an impressive 30% return on invested capital. As always, I would like to call your attention to Slide 5 and talk briefly about our company's fundamental focus on continuously improving our health, safety, and environmental performance. 2016 was another year of top decile safety performance within our industry. Unfortunately with our increased level of maintenance and expansion work, the number of process safety incidents rose during the year. While I'm pleased to see the continued employee safety improvements, we remained focused on our drive to capture the lessons learnt from our experiences and work towards safety perfection. Our annual results summarized on Slide number 6 provide some perspective on the company\u2019s earnings profile over the past several years and quarters. Our results have proven to be more durable and resilient and many might have thought through the swing in crude oil pricing seen over the past three years. The result shown on the bottom of this slide illustrates quarterly profile similar to 2015 when seasonal trends enabled us to capture the benefits of relatively tight Olefins & Polyolefins markets through the spring and the summer. Margin compression and reduced production due to maintenance reduced profitability late in the year. Slide 7 summarizes some of the notable financial and operating accomplishments for 2016. Our Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment and our Technology segment both achieved their second consecutive year of record EBITDA results. Income from equity investments increased to an all time high of $367 million on improved results from our joint ventures in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Poland. Our $5.6 billion of cash flow from operations enables us to buy back 37 million shares or 8% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of 2016. We increased our interim dividend by 9% to $0.85 per share bringing our total dividend for 2016 to $3.33 per share, and we continue to optimize our balance sheet with new euro denominated bonds issued at the lowest rate in company history. On the operational side, LyondellBasell remained true to our roots with our strong focus on safety, costs, and manufacturing performance that enabled us to achieve 38 annual production records, despite the heavy maintenance schedule. We finished our 20% U.S. ethylene expansion program with the startup of our Corpus Christi expansion. Unfortunately in early July, the Corpus Christi plant experienced an operational issue which will delay the majority of the benefit from the 800 million pound expansion until late in the second quarter. In the commercial arena, our O&P Americas team have been successful in fully contracting our merchant ethylene volumes through 2019. Finally, we continue to manage our asset portfolio with several small acquisitions, restructuring, and divestitures. As I discussed in our third quarter teleconference, we engaged in investment bank last year to assist us with the testing of the value of our refinery, both as part of our regular reviews of our asset portfolio and due to indications of interest received from third parties. After a thorough process, we elected to retain the refinery. Thomas will now discuss our financial highlights. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 8 which puts fourth quarter and full year segment results. As Bob already mentioned, both O&P-EAI and the Technology segments achieved their second consecutive year of record EBITDA during 2016 with O&P-EAI surpassing $2 billion. Bob will review these results in more detail during the segment discussions. Our fourth quarter results included a $58 million charge for a lump sum pension settlement that negatively impacted the quarter by $0.09 per share. In addition, our full year results included the $78 million after-tax gain on the sale of our Argentine polymer business. During the 2016 cost process, we addressed an issue within our primary tax calculations. The issue is not material to any period and pertains to the other complicated tax accounting for our cross currency debt swap. As a result during fourth quarter we had recorded $61 million non-cash out of period cumulative correction charge for 2014, 2015, and through the third quarter of 2016. The impact to the full year 2016 results to correct for the 2014 and 2015 out of period amount is $74 million. These are non-cash charges and will not impact our cumulative taxes over the life of this loan. However, it does negatively impact our fourth quarter and 2016 effective tax rate by 5.8 and 1.4 percentage points respectively. Together the pension settlement and the correction charge adversely impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.24 per share. The combined impact of the pension settlement, the correction charge, and the gain on the sale of our Argentine polymer business negatively impacted full year 2016 earnings by $0.07 per share. Please turn to Slide 9 which provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2016, we generated $5.6 billion of cash from operations. We also took advantage of favorable markets and further optimized our euro to U.S. dollar debt balances by issuing \u20ac750 million in bonds at a coupon rate of 1.875%. The cash and short-term security balance remained relatively constant for the year at $2.4 billion. Turning to Slide 10, you can see that the $5.6 billion in cash from operations during 2016 compares well with the prior three years. This strong cash generation has allowed us to fund both internally reinvestments and returns to shareholders. Over the past four years, we have funded $6.7 billion of capital investments, approx one half of this investment was allocated to profit generating growth project. We have returned $20.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases over the past four years. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 179 million shares or approximately 31% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of 2016, we had approximately 21 million shares or 50% remaining under the current 18 months share repurchase authorization that begun in May of 2016. As we do every year, I would like to address some of your 2017 modeling questions. Regarding capital, we are currently planning to spend approximately $2 billion during 2017. This spending level advances both our base maintenance and growth program approximately 45% is targeted toward profit generating growth. A large part of this growth investment in 2017 will be dedicated to the new Hyperzone polyethylene plant that is scheduled to begin production in 2019. Although not all plants are finalized yet, we estimate capital spending to range between $2 billion and $2.5 billion annually to 2021. Approximately 50% of this spent is targeted toward profit generating growth. The largest individual growth project in this period is PO/TBA plant that we plan to advance toward a final investment position in the first-half of 2017. Our net cash interest expense for 2017 is expected to be approximately $350 million with a weighted average cost of long-term borrowings of close to 5%. 2017 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.1 billion. We plan to make regular pension contribution in 2017 a total approximately $110 million and we estimate the pension expense of approximately $65 million. We currently expect a 2017 effective tax rate of approximately 27%, the cash tax rate is expected to be slightly lower. Now, I will turn the call back to Bob for a discussion of our segment results. Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 11, as mentioned previously my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $592 million, $90 million less than the third quarter. For the full year segment EBITDA was $2.9 billion. Relative to the third quarter ethylene margins decreased by $0.06 per pound, excluding our scheduled maintenance at Corpus Christi our equity our ethylene site operating rates remain strong during the quarter, averaging 96%. 67% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 85% came from NGLs. In Polyolefins combined results improved by approximately $100 million. Our polyethylene price spreads over ethylene improved by approximately $0.02 per pound while volume is declined. Similarly polypropylene volumes are seasonal declines during the fourth quarter while our spreads over propylene improved by approximately $0.04 per pound. At fourth quarter industry benchmark margins, the net value of lost production related to the Corpus Christi turnaround is estimated to be $40 million. For the full-year results decreased by $915 million due to ethylene margin decline of approximately $0.06 per pound and ethylene production volumes following by 13% mainly due to our planned maintenance. Polyolefins results declined by approximately $120 million from the prior year as polyethylene spreads declined by approximately $0.04 per pound, while polypropylene spreads improved by a similar amount. Polyethylene volumes were constrained due to maintenance at our Morris facility and polypropylene volumes failed due to the divestiture of the Argentine plant earlier in 2016. During January polyethylene and propylene prices rallied by use of increased cracker maintenance while ethane cost declines, this resulted in improved olefins margins. Polyolefin exports have increased reducing domestic inventories and lending support to monomer-driven price increases. Expected delays for the new capacity volumes should provide continued support for these favorable market conditions. Our North American ethylene system will be limited by planned maintenance on a co-product processing unit at Channelview that is estimated to have a $40 million impact on first quarter results. Additionally, we are only expecting a small share of the benefits of the Corpus Christi expansion volumes in the first quarter. Let's turn to Slide 12 and review performance in the olefins and Polyolefins, Europe Asia and international segment. During the fourth quarter underlying EBITDA was $398 million or $186 million lower than third quarter. For the full year underlying EBITDA was a record of nearly $2.1 billion and $212 million increase versus 2015. Olefins results decreased versus the third quarter by approximately $120 million due to lower margins resulting from increased cost of raw materials and reduce volumes due to planned maintenance at one of our crackers in Wesseling, Germany. Combined Polyolefins results declined by $50 million due to pressure on spreads for both polymers. Open results for the full year declined by approximately $20 million from 2015. Our Polyolefins results increased approximately $180 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting improved spreads for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Equity income increased by $19 million primarily due to our joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Kuwait. During January markets were relatively consistent with demand improving after the holidays. Within the industry five European crackers are scheduled to be in turnaround during March and April. With no maintenance schedule for our European crackers we are well positioned to serve the market. Now please turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of our intermediates and derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $306 million and relatively consistent with the third quarter. For the full-year the segment generated EBITDA of $1.3 billion, representing a decline of $323 million from a record high established during 2015. The fourth quarter reflected the net result of improvements in propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals offset by seasonal decline in margins and volumes. Intermediate chemicals improvements were primarily driven by improved methanol and ethylene glycol margin and the completion of third quarter maintenance. During 2016, margin compression from ethanol, ethylene glycol, PO and derivatives and PO sales mix were the primary drivers for the approximately $200 million decline in intermediate chemical and PO and derivatives results relative to 2015. Oxyfuels declined by approximately $90 million as high gasoline inventories, reduced margins relative to the strong profit theme during the 2015 driving season. The new year has started with stable demand in propylene oxide market. Oxyfuels margins remain near typical winner levels. Styrene and methanol margins have strengthened with spot methanol prices exceeding $1 per gallon. Our PO/TBA facility in the Netherlands will begin a two months turnaround in mid-March that is estimated to impact earnings by total of $40 million primarily in the second quarter. Now let's move to Slide 14 for a discussion of our refining results. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $81 million and improvement of $91 million from the prior quarter. For the full year the segment generated $72 million of EBITDA, decline of $447 million versus 2015. During the fourth quarter approximately half of the increased profitability was provided by low-priced crude inventory consumption. Relative to the third quarter crude throughput improved by 19,000 barrels to 228,000 barrels per day. Despite the improvement rates were impacted by several operating issues that reduced results by approximately $40 million. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark was relatively unchanged and the cost of RINs increased by approximately $7 million. Crude throughput average 201,000 barrels per day during 2016, down 37,000 barrels per day from 2015. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark decreased by approximately $3 per barrels to average approximately $19 per barrel. The cost of RINs increased by approximately $30 million. During 2016 reduced industry margins and several planned and unplanned maintenance events at our Houston refinery resulted in unacceptably poor performance. Our refinery team is diligently implementing our strategy to improve this asset reliability and performance going forward. We are currently performing planned maintenance on the fluid unit and one of the crude units at the refinery. That is expected to may impact first quarter results by approximately $80 million. Turning to Slide 15, let's step back and consider the changes that are occurring in our core olefins and Polyolefins markets. Shown in the upper right global demand growth for Polyolefins has been a steady and consistent factor for at least the past 25 years. Our polymers are largely used in nondurable applications that track demographic trends related to urbanization and growing consumer class around the world. These demand growth trends are expected to continue. Product spreads shown on the left for North America and Europe illustrated few trends. First, the improvement in polypropylene profitability is evident in the upward trend of the grey bars in both regions. With very little new capacity in these regions the outlook is bright for our nearly 12 billion pounds of global polypropylene capacity. Margin in spread for ethylene and polypropylene are seeing in some of the two blue bars for each year. North America has seen a shift in margin from ethylene and polypropylene, but the underlying development of the North American shale advantage has been strong over the past five years. European NAFTA based production has also been very profitable. Lower crude oil prices and good global and regional operating rates supported the improvement you see in European results. Again LyondellBasell's global scale offers considerable leverage to these trends. On Slide 16, I'd like to offer our views on how we expect the industry environment to develop during 2017. From a macro view, we already mentioned how we expect moderate but steady growth to continue to support demand. In North America we expect good NGL stock availability from shale plays production to continue but higher crude price is driving higher production and moderately increasing the crude to gas ratio that underpins the shale advantage. New ethylene and polyethylene capacity coming online during the latter part of 2017 will undoubtedly counter some of this improvement with increased supply and price competition. Global supply and demand balances continue to suggest that this decline will not be as deep for as long as initial predictions had indicated. For I&D markets we do not see much change in the balance type market that we see during 2016, while each product has unique aspect we see continuing strength in styrene, an upside from ethanol would benefit related to higher crude and coal prices in Asia. Tier 3 low sulphur fuel regulations and market absorption of the excess gasoline capacity seen during 2016 should support improvements for our low sulphur high octane oxy fuels. The same issues also point toward improving refining margins for 2017. Let me conclude the business discussion with Slide 17. During 2016 we completed our multi-year U.S. ethylene expansion program that added 2 billion pound of capacity to our system. We also concluded a year of exceptionally high plan and unplanned maintenance that should provide benefits and year-over-year volume improvements for LyondellBasell during 2017. Over the past year, the diversity within our product portfolio were seen as our polypropylene business provided partial offset to lower polyethylene chain margins. In the early weeks of 2017, global markets for our products are favorable, with the relatively light maintenance schedule for 2016 LyondellBasell is well positioned to serve these markets over the coming years. Before we open the line for your questions, please turn to Slide 18, I want to make you aware of two upcoming investor events. In March we will again be holding a reception here in Houston for those who will be attending the IHS World Petrochemical Conference and a Bank Sponsored Chemical Conference. The reception will be on Tuesday, March 21 at the conclusion of the day's activities near our offices and the conference venue. And on Wednesday April 5, we will hold our next Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan. Both these events will allow you time to interact with members of our executive leadership team and learn more about our plans for the future. Please watch your email for invitations or contact Doug Pike or Dave Kinney for further details. This year's reception and Investor Day will be bittersweet for us at LyondellBasell as they will be some of the last events that Doug Pike will host for us. After nearly 40 years with our company and 15 years as Head of Investor Relations, Doug has elected to retire shortly after our Investor Day in April. I know that Doug's work is highly appreciated by the investment community and that is just one of the many reasons why we hold him in such high regard within the company. So we hope our events will provide you with one more chance to meet with Doug and join us in congratulating him as he moves on to the next chapter in his life. The reception and Investor Day will also allow you to spend more time with Dave Kenny who will assume leadership with immediate effect for Investor Relations. I'm sure many of you have already met Doug during the past year as he has worked closely with Doug. Dave also has a deep background in the industry through 25 years of experience in research, strategy, planning, sales and business management with work across all of the segments within LyondellBasell. I'm confident you will find Dave to be another great resource to help you learn more about our industry and about our company. So with that, we are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Thank you. Yes, congrats on the announcement, Doug, definitely be surely missed. And first off, I just had a question on America's O&P. You characterized that there has been some improvement in the markets due to delays. I also wanted to get your thoughts on just overall margins. Propane and ethane have been moving up as well. How would you characterize your outlook for 2017 margins? And also there's a price increase for polyethylene for February. Do you have any characterization of whether that would go through or not? Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Yes, good morning, Arun. First of all on markets, so yes propane and butane have moved up but we typically see that from a seasonal perspective during the heating season. In response to that, ethane cracking rates have been pretty high and ethane prices have been still moderate, I think that indicates that there is still lot of ethane supply and also what you\u2019ve probably noticed of recent is that, co-product values have come up quite a lot, so propylene and butadiene have come up - in the case of butadiene , it has come up globally. So all of that points to better margins in ethylene. Normally, we see more maintenance, planned maintenance during the spring season as demand also picks up, so we are very constructive about our margin outlook and with normal [ph] increases, as you have heard me mentioned there some polymer increases that are out there. So we have to see how all that goes, but I think what underpins markets today is that there is very little inventory and market seems to be very balanced going into the spring season. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. And then on I&D, it looks like there also is potential for some positive price movement in some of your markets. Maybe you can just help us understand how you view acetic and VEM and some of these areas that may be positively impacted by rising coal prices in China? Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : Yes, so on methanol, it's benefited from a rise in oil prices in the second half of last year, and as many know, there has been a rise in the coal price in Asia as well. So we see that sort of underpinning cost for these marginal producers in Asia and with globally high operating rates in ethylene, I think that's the higher flow. With regards to I&D, certainly the higher methanol prices are favorable for us in the I&D segment. Styrene remains very tight, it seems, and there has been some upward movement in pricing there. In oxyfuels, we are expecting better year this year, as a year ago there was a lot of inventory in gasoline, and so crack spreads have declined and also blend premiums were much lower, so we see some upward movement in methanol, styrene, and oxyfuels as we work through the year, those markets should be pretty good. Arun Viswanathan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. You said that you've got about 20 million shares remaining on your authorization, and you bought back roughly 5 million in the quarter. Historically, you've been able to complete your share repurchase by midyear. Does it look like it may take until the end of 2017 to complete the residual shares that you've not purchased yet? Thomas Aebischer : It's Thomas Aebischer speaking, thanks for the question. I don\u2019t think we should focus the share repurchase program quarter-by-quarter. The way to look at it ,we initiated the new 10C51 in May of 2016 and completed virtually 50% by year end of that existing program, roughly 8.3% for the full year and as we have said in the material in front of you, it is an 18 months program, and obviously we are not commenting on future - how we are going to buy in the future, but clearly have the intention to finish the program as we have done in the past. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay. Your cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter. And when you look at depreciation and net income and working capital changes, it comes to about $1.2 billion. What led to the extra $500 million in cash generation in the quarter? Bhavesh Patel : So, we clearly had - you saw the change in networking capital on one end and on the other end we had significantly lower cash tax for 2016. Main reason for the significantly lower cash tax expense is the 2015 retroactive enactment of accelerated tax depreciation in the U.S., but we have significantly overpaid in 2015, which we didn\u2019t receive the benefit in 2016. Or maybe just continue on this looking at the cash tax rate for 2017 that will be again higher than what you have seen in 2016 somewhere around 22 - between 22% and 24%. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Robert Koort : Thank you very much. Good morning. Bob, I was curious if you had any thoughts. Historically, we looked at pretty high correlation between industry operating utilization rates and margins, and that trend has maybe gone off kilter a little bit the last few years as rates went up and margins came in a bit. How do you look at that dynamic as you go forward? You mentioned a little softening of rates. Is that something that changes in feed stocks can offset, or what do you think will be the critical driver in determining margin structure in the next couple of years? Bhavesh Patel : I mean those are probably just quarter-to-quarter sort of changes in markets, but fundamentally I think our operating rates point higher margin and the softness in operating rate that I alluded to is more about late 2017 through 2018. There are some of the new capacity comes online. But as you know there have been delays and so we'll have to see how that goes. To the extent that in the case of ethylene there is more propane or butane cracking and certainly that would yield less ethylene and therefore high ethylene. I think that fundamental relationship still largely holds. Robert Koort : Got it. And then if you could maybe help us out on two quick ones. What's the reason that Corpus isn't contributing more here in the first quarter? Can you give us some stab at what normalized refining margins might be for your asset base? Bhavesh Patel : In the case of Corpus we had an operating issue, we have to make some repairs over there and the net effect is that we'll realized a little bit of our expanded volume will resume sort of production of the full prior volume. And then as we move into the second quarter we'll fully ramp up on that expansion. So we are just working through a few errors, which will take us couple of months. So that's Corpus and now on refining margins we have not really provided outlooks for our refinery per se. But I'll tell you we're focused on as more reliable operation over there. Our team has a really great plan and they are executing on that plan. They are very committed to very different year this year. And once we\u2019re done with this FCC and through unit turnaround that we are in right now, there is really nothing else planned at the refinery for the rest of the year in terms of major maintenance. Robert Koort : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Jonas Oxgaard : Morning. Sorry to hear that you're leaving us, Doug. You'll be missed. Douglas Pike : Thank you. Jonas Oxgaard : Question on butadiene. So Asia price is now hitting $3,000, and Asia is usually the leading indicator. Do you think we'll see $3,000 Europe, U.S.? And what kind of impact does that have on your earnings, if that remains the rest of the year? Bhavesh Patel : Well, so let's talk a little about why that's happening. First of all I think it\u2019s an indication of very strong demand on globally for butadiene and market has come back a long way from lows that we saw couple of years ago. In Asia we saw very strong buying in fourth quarter and even ahead of Lunar New Year holiday, which is not typical. Normally you see activity really get quite over there and the people are buying we think that there are few factors that are driving some of the buying and what might impact Q1.  First of all I guess there was some fires in the national rubber plantations so the fairly heavy cracker maintenance schedule for both Asia and Europe in Q1 and Q2. European crackers have shifted to more LPG cracking which yield less butadiene. So let me put all that together there is less butadiene expected global in terms of supply in the near-term and demand seems to be very robust. As far as pricing outlook certainly market look to be very tight in the near-term, so we'll have to see how demand develops. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay. And follow-up on that, I know your Channelview C4 separation facility's idle. Is there an opportunity to take overseas cargoes in there? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, we are always looking for those opportunities and we have excess capacity. But I think because of the planned maintenance in Europe, which is usually the exporting regions, it's unlikely that we are going to build access much more. Also I mentioned that we have a turnaround going on in our C4 unit in Q1. So I think in Q2 we will be better positioned to take advantage of incremental importance of the crude butadiene, we're always looking for that Jonas. Jonas Oxgaard : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura International. Your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. Your ethylene production in 2016 was 8.4 billion pounds. Is it fair to assume that you will be somewhere around 10.4 billion pounds in 2017, absent some unplanned outages? Bhavesh Patel : Well, as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks that on Corpus Christi we'll probably see our expansion at full rates late Q2. So that expansion is 800 million pounds you could probably take about half of that all from the number and I think the rest is about rise, so I would deduct 400 million from that number. Aleksey Yefremov : Okay, got it. Thank you. And could assure your outlook for the US merchant ethylene market, do you think on balance it will be more favorable to you in 2017 than 2016 or same or worse? Bhavesh Patel : Aleksey, it seems to us that because of some of the timing of derivatives being ahead of crackers in the ethylene market looks to be very balanced type in 2017. We will have to see how crackers operate. But in the past generally you have seasonal upticks in demand in Q2 and Q3, usually the period when there is planned maintenance. And with more derivatives more of the derivative capacity maybe being phased to couple of quarters ahead of crackers, there is a potential for very constructive ethylene market in 2017. So that mentioned in my earlier comments, we contracted our merchant ethylene through 2019 now. So no cracker turnarounds, we already run pullout other than Corpus in the first half. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. A final question, if I may, on the refinery sale. Was the uncertainty around the tax code a big, big part of that decision? Or are there other issues that were more important? Bhavesh Patel : No, please note that tax really wasn\u2019t a factor frankly in our decision. As we engage in the evaluations in the middle of the year if you think about how market evolves, market is softened through the year refining outlook became weaker. Frankly our operations were disappointing and we're working on that. So we had both internal and external factors moving the long way. And our conclusion was that is not the right time to make a move. So we're firmly focused on improving the operation over there and controlling the things that are in our hands, as well as we can. Aleksey Yefremov : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Bob, on polyethylene margins, how would you expect them to trend through the year if we do have this additional derivative capacity coming on stream? Did you believe you over-earned the polyethylene margins the last, perhaps, 18 months and these margins might normalize by the end of 2017? Bhavesh Patel : No I think first of all you got to start David with global markets. David Begleiter : Yes. Bhavesh Patel : And demand has been growing at 4% plus globally even Europe is seeing 1.5% kind of growth rates. So our view first of all is that demand growth is still going to be in mid 4s% year-over-year. There\u2019s spacing in the capacity that is coming in the U.S. as I just mentioned in the prior question that ethylene is going to be fairly balance or tight so that will probably underpin polyethylene pricing. And so our expectation is that we still see pretty good market in polyethylene through this year and may be seasonally in the fourth quarter you see softer demand, but yet more capacity coming that will probably increase the need to export I would suspect from the U.S. but I\u2019m pretty constructive for most of the year given that ethylene is going to be pretty tight we think. David Begleiter : Very good. Bob, and just longer term, now that we're looking forward to the end of the decade. Looking at M&A beyond maybe your core commodity businesses, how are you thinking about perhaps longer term the portfolio of LyondellBasell, if you might integrate maybe a little further downstream? How does that play into your thinking? Bhavesh Patel : Well, we first think about is, what are our strengths and how can we leverage those to create value and our focus is on safe and reliable and cost efficient operations. I think we understand how to operate in commodity markets and allocate capital. I&D has the stability of more of a specialty type of business, but still fits more of a commodity sort of product profile. So downstream in I&D certainly is interesting and in the odd period where we are today is still fairly wide open. So these are kind of things we\u2019re going to try to elaborate on in our Analyst Day in April. So we\u2019ll frame this much better and help everyone to understand how we think about long-term grow for LyondellBasell so stayed tuned. David Begleiter : Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : And perhaps in the interest of so I\u2019m just looking at time here and length of the queue so I\u2019m going to ask people if they could stay to one question please, I apologize for that need but it's still fairly long queue of questions. Okay thanks David. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. Don Carson : Yes thank you. Bob, question on the refinery. What would be the benefit, it looks like Keystone may go ahead now, how would that benefit your refinery? Would you be able to get a lot of additional heavy Canadian crude in? And with that, and if you do show better performance, are we to surmise that the refinery could come up again on the block if you can demonstrate higher value? Bhavesh Patel : With respect to the Keystone certainly more crude getting to the Gulf Coast heavier crude is in our wheelhouse so to speak that's a heavy processing refinery that we own. And so that's positive for us. Our focus is on running at consistently at the highest rates possible. I have met with team over there a couple of weeks ago and they have a great plan, look forward to them executing the plan and getting back to what we know that refinery can do and that our focus. Don Carson : And can you be more specific on the Canadian crude? How much you could get? If Keystone does run with that, what sort of heavy slate could you run out of Western Canada if that was the case? Douglas Pike : Well this is Doug Don, that\u2019s a little bit hard because we got moving things \u2013 in the equation here including production. But you can see over the past couple of years since we've been able to receive meeting crude by pipeline we typically run up towards 30% or so of our crude is Canadian. If the economic are right and the availability is there we can do more stuff. So that will move with economics for us and as Bob said, the more availability, the better they should be. Don Carson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matt Gingrich : Thanks. This is actually Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I'm wondering if it's possible to quantify the total one-time maintenance expenses incurred in 2016, and then maybe a rough estimate of what you think 2017 will be? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Doug. Douglas Pike : This is Doug again your number of items I don't have them all totaled in front of me, but you could see at the refinery we\u2019re probably looking at upwards to around $200 million plus there. And then if you think on the Olefins side in Americas you had two turnarounds probably it\u2019s more or less about $40 million or so and of course Corpus was down really for three quarters of the year. So you can pick that and basically just look at the volume impact on that. Over in Europe we had two turnarounds. So you had, each one would run about the same as the Morris kind of size. Bhavesh Patel : And those volumes we had highlighted those in our Q3 earnings call slides so I think you can refer to those for the volume impacts. Matt Gingrich : Yes, I think that. Bhavesh Patel : Kind of maintenance the biggest item was really the refinery as Doug mentioned so. Douglas Pike : I hope you can get an idea on that. We can talk some more if we need to Matt Gingrich : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citigroup. Your line is now open. PJ Juvekar : Yes. Hi, good morning. What are polyethylene inventories in US and China today with the converters? And then secondly, as new capacity starts up, most of that will get likely exported. Where does that go? And then secondly is a stronger dollar a concern for you with those exports? Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Yes, so on converter inventory our sense is that they\u2019re normal to be a little bit below normal both here and in Asia and the reason I say that is we saw pretty good buying in polyethylene both here and in Asia, in Asia especially prior to the Lunar New Year. Normally things go very quite over there and they didn\u2019t this year. So our sense is that demand and inventories are such that there was a need to buy. In terms of the new capacity being exported where would it go certainly for ethylene derivatives Asia is a primary destination and just given the balances and demand growth over there is a need for polyethylene. For example for Asia so we think the market is there and in terms of the dollar I suspect if the market is there then prices will adjust accordingly depending on however the dollar shape up. So I kind of think more fundamentally about supply demand and it seems operating rates it should be very constructive globally in 2017. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Bob. Bob, quick question around the MTO side of things. Obviously methanol prices have shored up a fair bit, and it just seems that on a standalone non-integrated MTO economic basis, you'd be in the red, right? But it seems that profitability for these facilities is being buoyed by downstream units. So just wanted to hear your views on how you think near- to medium-term -- what the near to medium term looks like in terms of empty or utilization rates, as well as incremental capacity adds? Bhavesh Patel : Well again I come back to global operating rates and I think with MTO the first thing we got to think about is that capacity needed to meet demand. And I think the answer is yes, the operating rates are high enough that that last incremental capacity is needed. MTO costs are somewhere around 51, 52 I think ethylene price in Asia is about 50 but very close. And so I suspect that if the need is there then prices would have to rise to cover the cost of this high cost producer. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be watching for as Q1 develops. But our sense is that MTO will continue to operate given where demand is globally and I thinking prices have to be particularly in the money. Hassan Ahmed : Perfect. Thanks so much Bob. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Stephen Byrne : Yes. Thank you. Just continuing in China here, how do you look at demand growth for polyethylene in China versus supply growth there? And on the supply side in addition to the MTO question, are you seeing any evidence of rationalization of CTO capacity there for environmental reasons? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So, Steve if you would look at IHS balances even from two years ago they had a lot more CTO capacity than you would see today, if you look in the balances and to your point beyond the environmental considerations oil prices have come up as well and CTO processes require water. So there are lots of things that point to less CTO. We see a bit of that because we have a view into that market given our licensing business and we do see moderation in activity. On the demand side now - I think polyethylene demand is going to continue to grow at very good rates and it seems to me that the need for imports will be consistently there. And I think if you look at global balances over time U.S. capacity - additional capacity should be absorbed relatively quickly compared to prior cycles that we have seen. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Frank Mitsch : Hi, good morning gentlemen. Bob, a little more of a strategic question for you. Given that Doug is worth at least 100 multiple bps on you EBITDA multiple, how do you plan on replacing that? Bhavesh Patel : I am still - I was tearing up earlier just reading that, that Doug leaving, Frank. Look we are going to miss Doug, he's been a great force in the company and frankly you know he helped me during my transition two years ago and was really invaluable, Though I'll probably say, there is few other times in different forms, we really appreciated everything he's done. Unfortunately, we have Dave who has a lot of experience, has been an understudy for about a year under Doug. So, I am expecting Dave to not only make up that 100 bps- it\u2019s going to be his KPI. Frank Mitsch : All right. Good luck, Dave, on doing that. I also want to understand the Corpus Christi issue a little bit better. I think you were talking about it being the existing asset is down, as well as the 800 million pound expansion. Is that correct? I think you had originally sized the investment in that project of being $800 million. With the most recent delays and repairs, et cetera, are we looking at a material cost overrun there? Bhavesh Patel : No, I am sorry about that. So let me explain perhaps I didn't say it properly earlier. There are not separate units. It's one unit essentially and to be very simplistic we increased the size of just about everything, but its one factor at the end of the day. We have one part of that unit that is not able to run at full rates. Therefore, we cannot run all of our furnaces and process everything through. So there is no cost overrunning act beyond what we know today. It\u2019s just a matter of some repairs and requires long lead equipment. And so we\u2019re expediting that as much as possible and our aim is to ramp-up the full rates towards the end of Q2, but just it\u2019s one unit there are not separate units. Frank Mitsch : Okay. All right. And thanks for the clarification. Douglas Pike : Frank it is running. I mean, it\u2019s running but closer to its pre-expansion rates then opposed to expansion rates. Frank Mitsch : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open. Duffy Fischer : Good morning. Question on the Olefins versus Derivatives. You would delay the potential expansion on the Olefin side to focus on your polyethylene plant. But now you're kind of talking about Derivatives being looser than the Olefins. So can you just kind of marry those two views? If ethylene is going to be tight, derivatives are going to be a little bit loose relative, why wouldn't we have pushed that next expansion as opposed to focusing on the derivative? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Good morning, Duffy. So this fading of derivatives and crackers in the industry, it\u2019s sort of the emerge - that middle of 2016. I think it\u2019s very temporary. We are talking about a couple of quarters not structural. Structurally in our view the story hasn't changed and so if you think about our derivative expansion, our polyethylene expansion is targeted to come on stream somewhere in the middle of 2019 and that will consume some of these debottleneck ethylene that we've already got coming to market. And then that last expansion debottleneck that we have delayed. We still intend to do it. So structurally there is no change it\u2019s more just near-term saving in the big projects which is probably two or three quarters not even a full year. Duffy Fischer : Okay, terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. My question relates to your U.S. ethylene margins. On table 9 of your press release you show some very helpful benchmark data that would seem to suggest that U.S. benchmark margins declined about $0.04 a pound in the fourth quarter sequentially from the third quarter. And on Slide 11 of your deck, I think you indicate your own margins were down $0.06 per pound. And so I'm wondering if you can speak to that differential, what might be causing it in terms of your asset base or feed stock mix? And whether or not you would expect that to reverse at some point in the first quarter or beyond? Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : There is always a little bit of noise and variation across the benchmark to our actual site and it\u2019s nothing really unusual some quarter go one way, some will go the other kind of depend on mix, mix of raw materials and operating rates and also your sales mix but nothing more than that. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. So kind of transitory noise there, such that perhaps it'll renormalize at some point down the road? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you very much. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you. Kevin McCarthy : Perfect Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thanks. Doug, best wishes as well. Douglas Pike : Thank you. John Roberts : Bob, in your refining deal discussions, was your earnings outlook higher than the potential buyers, or was it simply a valuation difference between you and the buyers on a relatively consensus outlook that prevented a deal? Bhavesh Patel : I think - again given sort of the challenges we had in the operations at the plant and if you recall in Q3 and Q4 outlook for the industry was being revised for the refining industry and so as we were trying getting through all of that perhaps we had different views on the capability of the refinery, as well as how the market might evolve. And there are lots of moving parts and as I had mentioned in the Q3 call it's not something that we felt we have to do, if there is a right value we would do it. As you know we have a very balance sheet. We generate a lot of cash so it's sort of it's not something that's necessary as a precedent doing something else. So it's really at the end of the day our view of value versus the buyers view value. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is now open. James Sheehan : Thank you. Sticking with the refinery for a moment, what do you think the impact would be on the refinery's profitability if Washington were to implement this proposed border tax adjustment? Bhavesh Patel : That something we are watching closely and we import most of the crude oil that we process there as you know. So, it would have an impact but when we think more broadly about the different strategies that are being discussed certainly lower corporate tax rate and more balanced energy and environmental regulations and all those things, those certainly will benefit and so - we just have to watch and see how that develops and suspect that something like that were in place eventually downstream prices would adjust and we'd have to think about the second and third order effects of all that. James Sheehan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Nils Wallin from CLSA. Your line is now open. Nils Wallin : Thanks, and good afternoon. Just had a question - you mentioned earlier, Bob, that the discussion about the potential for ethylene to be short, as you have different phasing of the derivative units versus the expansions, has been in discussion since maybe middle of 2016. So with respect to the producers that will be engaged in this phasing, why wouldn't they have built enough inventory so that they don't get short when this actually transpires? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, I think that\u2019s difficult to predict about inventories and I suspect that I can only got out from my experience that on startups it's not that predictable in terms of will be making product on ex-date. So I suspect that people looked balances and say there is - there are merchant seller's who have ethylene and we'll buy such that we price ethylene in the market and sell derivatives in the market. So again I think in terms of ethylene tight perhaps a bit stronger I would say. We are going to be \u2013 certainly going to see very balanced markets but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be short, I think that's the word you'd use, I mean, tight is probably characterization. And then we\u2019ll see how everyone operates. So - and this is through Q2 and Q3. Nils Wallin : Understood, thanks very much. And just one quick follow-on. Butadiene, obviously you've mentioned how the price has moved up a little, quite significantly and in Europe. I believe you had had a favorable contract in butadiene in Europe at one time, but it was sort of fixed in terms of margin. Are you able to participate at all in the fly-up in the butadiene prices? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So those have largely are now rolled off. Look at those back in 2011 and 2012 associated with our expansion but we should be able to take advantage of the upside. Nils Wallin : Got. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from the line of Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair : Thank you. Hi, Doug, best wishes going forward here. I just wanted to ask a question, your press release mentioned your optimism regarding NGL supply. And I was hoping you could elaborate on this and maybe share any production targets you might have. And then also, are you more optimistic on ethane production growth going forward or propane, or is it pretty similar? Thanks. Douglas Pike : Yes, I think our comments really relates higher oil price and higher drilling - more drilling activity in the Permian and we think eventually in the Eagle Ford. So, it's more towards NGL generally not just ethane as you know, you get propane and butane in certain proposition in mix NGL. So our sense as oil price increase, as crackers come up and there is a destination for the ethane that is otherwise been rejected and there is a market backdrop for more value being created from NGLs and that\u2019s kind of our simply our view. Matthew Blair : Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you. All right. So with that being the last question let me provide some closing thoughts here. First of all thank you for hanging in there a little bit beyond the hour. Thanks for all of your thoughtful questions and on conclusion markets are still relatively balanced and for us the past year was a year of really high maintenance both planned and unplanned throughout the Company and I think that\u2019s positioned us well to serve what we think are very constructive markets and developing in 2017. So we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year. Thank you for your interest in our company. Douglas Pike : Thanks everybody. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining and you may now all disconnect.",

Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies LLC Operator : Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Jen. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's first quarter 2017 teleconference. I am joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I would also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 :00 PM Eastern Time today, until midnight Eastern Time on May 28 by calling 800-839-9140 in the United States, and 203-369-3624 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 2526. During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current environment and near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and declines in the prices of our raw materials and finished goods inventories in the previous periods. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding impacts of the prior LCM inventory charges. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Dave. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted earnings were $2 per share with EBITDA of $1.6 billion. We continue to deliver solid results with three of our five operating segments improving in profitability relative to the fourth quarter. We continue to optimize our debt portfolio by redeeming and refinancing $1 billion at an after-tax cost of $106 million. This reduced first quarter earnings by $0.26 per share. Our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well and we completed planned maintenance in our refinery and the Channelview co-product processing units. Planned maintenance and other non-routine costs impacted first quarter results by approximately $250 million. We continue to execute on our financial priorities during the first quarter, and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments. Slide 5 reflects the leading safety performance that our employees and contractors continue to achieve during first quarter of this year. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on health, safety and environmental performance provides benefits to our operations and profitability as well as the more obvious direct benefits to our employees and neighboring communities. And now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the first quarter. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Bob. On slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. As Bob mentioned, three of our five business segments improved relative to the fourth quarter 2016 performance. During the quarter, strong ethylene co-product pricing benefited both our Olefins & Polyolefins segments while strong margin for methanol and styrene drove improvements in our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. The refinery experienced low seasonal margins and reduced volumes due to planned maintenance. Please turn to slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the first quarter, excluding changes in working capital, we generated over $1 billion of cash from operations and about half of this amount was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Our investments in maintenance and growth capital expenditure were $421 million during the first quarter, driven by maintenance turnaround, Hyperzone PE, PO/TBA, and Tier 3 gasoline projects. During the first quarter, our cash and liquid investments balance declined by $233 million in part due to a $432 million increase in accounts receivable, driven by higher product prices and volumes. Over the past 12 months, we generated $4.9 billion of cash from operations and used approximately $3.5 billion for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program and other financial activities, the cash and liquid investment balance declined by approximately $800 million. Slide 8 provides a longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years has positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase our shares. Additionally, it has allowed us to reduce our interest expense and access stable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB+/Baa1 credit ratings. We finished the quarter with approximately $5 billion of liquidity and a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4x. Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 1.5 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased approximately 181 million shares or approximately 31% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 20 million shares remaining under the existing authorization. In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early April, we proposed that our shareholders vote to authorize a new repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares. During March, we also took advantage of favorable financing conditions and issued $1 billion of 3.5% bonds due in 2027, and used the proceeds and available cash to redeem an equivalent amount of our 5% notes due in 2019. The new bond captures the lowest credit spread for a 10-year bond issuance in the company's history. This exercise allows us to mitigate refinancing risks in 2019 for our largest and nearest maturity bond, while also extending the weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio by one year to approximately 13 years. Through the use of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, we converted the 3.5% coupon to initial rate of approximately 1.2%. We incurred cash charges of approximately $65 million related to the bond redemption. Those cash charges in addition to other non-cash charges led to an after-tax accounting charge of approximately $106 million that reduced earnings by $0.26 per share. Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that may help your modeling of our company. Excluding the first quarter bond redemption charges, our expenses for interest, depreciation, amortization and our effective tax rate are all currently running in line with our previous annual estimates. With that, thank you very much for your attention. I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thanks, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 9 and review our segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $723 million, a $131 million improvement over the fourth quarter. This includes a first quarter $31 million gain from the sale of property in Lake Charles, Louisiana, fourth quarter 2016 pension settlement charges of $23 million and LIFO inventory charges of $20 million. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results improved by approximately $95 million. Ethylene margins improved by approximately $0.03 per pound and volumes increased following the completion of planned maintenance and implementation of our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion. Planned maintenance on our Channelview co-product units during the first quarter resulted in an estimated $110 million impact due to elevated butadiene prices during the quarter. Ethylene operating rates remained strong across our system during the quarter, averaging 91%. Our Corpus Christi ethylene plant continued to ramp up and operated at an average of 80% of the full expanded capacity during the first quarter. 74% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 87% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $45 million. Ethylene and propylene monomer price increases outpaced polyethylene and polypropylene prices, reducing spreads by approximately $0.02 per pound and $0.04 per pound, respectively. During April, spot ethylene prices have improved over first quarter averages, but are slightly lagging increasing cash costs. The quarter is benefiting from a $0.03 per pound March polyethylene price increase. Polypropylene prices have been tracking reduced prices of propylene with improving monomer supply. Our Channelview co-product units restarted in early April after planned maintenance. April operating rates for our Corpus Christi ethylene plant have been over 90% of the expanded capacity and are expected to be at the full expansion capacity by the end of the second quarter. No other maintenance is planned in our olefin system for the remainder of 2017. Turning to slide 10, I would like to highlight recent developments in ethane supply that we discussed during our recent Investor Day. U.S. demand for natural gas is growing on the Gulf Coast due to the commissioning of LNG export facilities, stronger industrial demand, and the increases in pipeline exports to Mexico. This 20% increase in gas demand will bring more ethane and other NGLs to market. In addition, the ethane content of the gas is increasing with more production from NGL-rich basins. As a consumer of ethane, we're always cognizant of the logistics and transportation costs associated with this supply. Fortunately, most of the recent activity has been focused in the Permian, Woodford and Eagle Ford Basins, which all have good connectivity to the Gulf Coast ethylene cracker market. Combination of these developments supports our ethane pricing views and have leading analysts and consultants to a more moderate view of future feedstock costs. Let's turn to slide 12 (sic) [11] and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $529 million or $131 million higher than the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 results reflected LIFO inventory charges of $17 million and a pension settlement charge of $8 million. Olefins results improved by approximately $60 million, with ethylene prices increasing nearly $0.03 per pound and higher co-product values offsetting higher naphtha costs. Our ethylene production volume increased due to the absence of fourth quarter maintenance. Utilization of advantaged feedstocks decreased by 4% as co-product credits outweighed the higher cost of naphtha feedstock. Our crackers operated at a 95% rate during the first quarter, exceeding industry performance by about 4%. Combined polyolefins results improved by approximately $50 million due to higher sales volumes. During April, global markets remained tight to balanced with increased maintenance across the industry during the spring months. As in the U.S., no major maintenance is planned in our European olefin system for the remainder of 2017. Turning to slide 12, we outlined our current view of the supply and demand picture for global ethylene. A year ago, many consultants were predicting a more severe reduction in operating rates as new U.S.-based capacity was expected to start up during 2017 and 2018. But with continued global demand growth and project delays, the decline from today's very high operating rates is forecast to be relatively shallow and short. We see effective operating rates remaining within and above this blue zone where markets are relatively balanced. Focus is now turning towards 2019 and 2020 where it appears that capacity utilization could exceed the high levels of 2015 and 2016. Please turn to slide 13 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $339 million, an improvement of $33 million from the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 results reflected a LIFO inventory charge of $16 million and a pension settlement charge of $16 million. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives improved by approximately $15 million. Increased margins for styrene and methanol were the primary driver for improved results of approximately $65 million in intermediate chemicals. The gains in both the PO and derivatives and intermediate chemicals businesses were offset by approximately $40 million of charges in the first quarter and $30 million of gains in the fourth quarter related to the recovery of precious metals after catalyst changes. Oxyfuels and related products results declined approximately $10 million on lower sales volume. Prices for styrene and methanol have moderated during April as industry production capacity returns to the market. Two months of planned maintenance began in mid-March at our PO/TBA facility in the Netherlands, that is expected to impact earnings by a total of $40 million primarily during the second quarter. Our Channelview methanol plant began planned maintenance in early April, that is expected to impact earnings by $20 million during the second quarter. Now, let's move to slide 14 for a discussion of the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was a $30 million loss, a decline of $111 million from the prior quarter. Please note that the fourth quarter included $46 million of LIFO gains from the consumption of low cost crude inventory. Planned maintenance on one of the two crude units and the fluid catalytic cracker reduced throughput, product yields and gasoline production. This reduced results by approximately $100 million during the first quarter. The cost of RINs decreased relative to the fourth quarter. During early April, we completed planned maintenance on a crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracker. Our investment in sulfur treatment for Tier 3 gasoline was also completed. We're pleased to report that the refinery has recently been operating near-nameplate rates and no major maintenance is planned for the second quarter. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with $60 million of EBITDA during the first quarter. Turning to slide 15, the first quarter developed largely as we anticipated. We continued to see strong and growing demand for our polyolefin products in all regions, supporting full chain margins for our O&P businesses. Our I&D segment benefited from strong styrene and methanol margins. While Refining results were impacted by planned maintenance, we completed our Tier 3 investments for low sulfur gasoline. We continued to optimize our debt portfolio by extending the maturity of our debt. Looking forward, we continue to see olefin and polyolefin market demand supporting strong global operating rates over the near term. While the recent high prices for ethylene co-products are subsiding, polyolefin chain margins remain strong for both our shale-based and naphtha-based production assets across the globe. We continue to see U.S. supply and inventories of natural gas and NGL feedstocks remaining abundant, and we are encouraged by increased production, transportation and fractionation investments near the U.S. Gulf Coast. In fuel markets, we are seeing the beginning of typical seasonal spread improvements that support both our oxyfuels and refining businesses. Planned maintenance at our facilities is expected to impact second quarter Intermediates & Derivatives results by approximately $40 million to $60 million. We currently expect our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion to ramp up to full rates during the second quarter. As many of you know, our Investor Day is typically held every two years and provides an opportunity to comprehensively discuss progress of our company and chart a path forward for the coming years. Please turn to slide 16 and allow me to review a few of our key messages from the Investor Day we held earlier this month. In this graphic, we depict how LyondellBasell's foundational strategy is rooted in consistent and simple themes. We focused on running our assets well, practicing prudent financial stewardship, capturing high-return organic growth and leveraging our strengths to find opportunities in the cycles of our industry. These messages are clearly understood across our company and supported by a relentless focus on operational excellence, performance benchmarking, and aligned incentive systems. Simple concepts but difficult to replicate with our robust processes and a dedicated team. Over the past seven years, we have shown LyondellBasell's leading performance in the upper left and upper right-thirds of this circular diagram. During our Investor Day, we devoted time to a topic that we seldom discuss : timing and capturing opportunities in cycles. Since 2010, we diligently built the framework for cost leadership, operational excellence and organic growth that resulted in substantial value generation for our shareholders. As shown on slide 17, we view inorganic growth as a logical extension to our capabilities to be pursued as and when opportunities present themselves. We don't intend to depart from the guiding principles that created our success. We do think it is logical to evaluate all options, including inorganic growth, to generate additional value for our company. During our Investor Day, we described some product chains where we believe our focus on discipline would improve value and illustrated the capacity within our balance sheet to pursue worthwhile opportunities. I won't try to review all these points in the limited time we have now, but let me emphasize that inorganic growth is only one option and, like other investments, requires a clear path to value creation. This was presented in the context of finding opportunities in cycles. We remain patient, thoughtful and disciplined as we pursue the next steps in LyondellBasell's evolution. Turning to slide 18, I would like to conclude with a few messages that we would like you to take away from our Investor Day. LyondellBasell already has a leading scale and market position built on strong foundations. We know the skills and strengths that created our success and are watchful for opportunities where with these capabilities can add value. Our portfolio of businesses is global and has breadth, advantaged positions and flexibility. Our work is supported by robust processes and a dedicated team of employees aligned with shareholder interest. In summary, LyondellBasell's prudent financial stewardship, strong dividend, low valuation and earnings upside provide a compelling case for investment. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. It looks like in your North American Olefins operation, you were squeezed a little bit in polyethylene, but maybe contract prices in polyethylene went up $0.05 in February and, I don't know, $0.03 in March. So was there a delay in capturing that price increase? And all things being equal, should we see a lot of the benefits of that in the second quarter? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Generally, we do have a lag in the implementation of those price increases compared to the announcement date. So I think it's very typical of what we've experienced in the past and indeed we should see the full benefit in Q2. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In Q2. And in the Refinery operation in April, were output rates very low, that is, did you average below 200,000 barrels a day or were you above that in April? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : In April, once we finished our maintenance, we've been running at essentially our design rate of about 270,000 barrels per day. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Did you finish that in early April, is that it? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. Early April. Yeah, about the second week. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Good. Thank you so much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just had a question on what you're seeing, I guess, in the olefins markets. There has those increases in February and March, inventories appear relatively low, your commentary suggests that you guys are excited about running full out for the rest of the year. But how do you see kind of the capacity playing out and pricing as well, given what's going on with feedstocks and demand? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, in the near term, Arun, we're headed into a period where, generally, demand picks up seasonally. As you likely mentioned, inventories especially here in the U.S. are on the low side. I think that's all very constructive as we go through the second quarter. As has been well noted, there are new capacity expansions coming online in the second half of this year. If you look under the headline of those expansions, quite a bit of it is linear low density polyethylene, a market in which we have very small participation. There's some low density and then of course some high density. So, I think it's important to consider the types of polyethylene that comprise these new expansions. And on the ethylene side, I think given that the derivatives in some cases are ahead by a quarter or two of the cracker expansions, we're pretty constructive about ethylene markets for the balance of this year. So, as you rightly said, we're focused on running full out for the remainder of the year. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just a quick follow-up on the other side, propylene was down a little bit in April. How are you looking at PO markets and that side of your business as well? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, PO demand is still very steady and as you know, quite a bit of our PO is sold on a cost-plus basis. So, we don't see a lot of volatility in terms of earnings in that part of I&D. For the remainder of I&D from a demand standpoint, things are very steady and as we had expected. On the supply side, there were some disruptions in supply in the industry in methanol and in styrene in Q1, but those seem to have resolved or largely resolved themselves and you're seeing pricing moderate. But if you look at pricing by historic standards, we're still at pretty healthy levels. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, thank you. Your chart that you show on the bottom of slide 9 that compares ethane-based versus naphtha-based cracking margins on ethylene would suggest you would have run more naphtha-based through your crackers in the first quarter. Is there a reason you didn't need as much of the byproducts or any comment on that? And where do you see that feedstock split right now and in the second quarter? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : We tilted a little bit more towards liquids, but just as a reminder, we have that co-product unit at Channelview that was out for planned maintenance for a couple of months. So that limited really our ability to flex towards more liquid cracking in the U.S. In Europe, we did move more towards naphtha cracking because of the higher co-product values. But those have now adjusted back a bit. Propylene has come down some. Butadiene has come down quite a lot in the last couple of months, still at pretty reasonable levels, but down from a very, very high peak earlier in the year. So I think where we are today, Steve, is we're back to NGL-cracking being favorable on both sides of the ocean. And so as we come into the summer months, propane and butane should be even more advantaged and more a part of the cracker mix. So we're kind of going back to what I would consider to be more normal (29:33) for U.S. and Europe. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And you mentioned butane is, as you look at that MTBE margin chart that you show, is that healthy margin you illustrate for April because of tightness in isobutylene or just pickup in demand for MTBE? What's driving that? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah generally, what drives that is a combination of two things, one is butane price coming down seasonally in the summer, because it comes out of the blend pool in gasoline. And then secondly, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, that we generally see spreads rising through the summer months for gasoline, so an improvement in gasoline spreads and butane coming down relative to crude oil. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Morning. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Bob, looking at the planned maintenance costs in Q2 versus Q1, just give us again the benefit of the oil pickup, given lower costs in Q2? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : So, Q1, including sort of the lost profit associated with us not producing, the impact was about $250 million in Q1, and we're expecting that to drop down to $40 million to $60 million in Q2, so about a $200 million improvement. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And just Bob, on the cadence of buybacks, a little bit low in Q1. You may have been constrained in any authorization. How should we think about buybacks in Q2 post the new authorization and Q3, back half of the year. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Sure, certainly. Let me start and then I'm sure Thomas will supplement with some comments. First of all, as noted, we have proposed for shareholder approval another 10% program for starting in May. Our AGM will be in the second half of May. And this effectively replaces the current program starting at the time of approval. David, I expect to continue to see share buybacks as part of our capital deployment strategy, given that we expect to generate strong free cash flow going forward. I think what we're doing a little bit more is we're trying to be a little more opportunistic to take advantage of general market volatility. This is not a shift in sort of our view on buybacks, it's really more sort of trying to optimize. So, Thomas, if you'd like to add a little more to that. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. So if I can add, we absolutely continue to believe that repurchasing our shares offers strong value and low risk. As we compare buybacks to organic growth projects and risk-adjusted M&A, share buybacks will continue to have a role in our portfolio of capital deployment options. And we don't comment on the details of our trading plans, the 10b5-1 pre-established plan will obviously be subject to the uncertainties of the market volatility with trading volumes at rates that could exceed or fall short of the predicted outcome. But I think the message here is what Bob has said, we go for another approval for an additional 10% and we still believe that the share buybacks offer a good option and good value. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Thank you. Bob, the on fourth quarter call, you'd indicated you just have about 2 billion pounds of additional ethylene in 2017 versus 2016 due to the Corpus Christi expansion and a lack of planned maintenance turnarounds. What is that number now given some of the outages that you had? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Don, I think it's still developing in that range. I mean we'll have to see how the year plays out. At Corpus Christi, as I mentioned, we've been ramping up through Q1 and on our way to 100% here of our full capacity. So, I think for now, you should assume that it's largely that same number and we'll update that as the year progresses. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Right. Okay. And I noticed your propylene production was down sharply year-over-year, was that related to the Channelview co-products unit being down or did that latter \u2013 or was Channelview just really a C4 item? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No, that was just mainly a C4 item. Propylene production also can be impacted by how far we're running on (34:29) unit, so that can have an impact. So, it's really about kind of optimization in their system. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then finally just a question on the polyethylene price outlook, you did get $0.08 in February and March, you said there's a lag in realizing that. It looks like the industry gave up on the $0.03 April initiative, has pushed that to May. How do you see polyethylene developing? As you said, it is seasonally stronger in Q2, but we do see some softness in offshore pricing. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. It feels tight to us and so we just kind of have to see how the quarter plays out. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Bob, that $40 million charge in I&D, I'm not sure I clearly understood what it was for, and we also noticed that this quarter's press release indicated that there was a slightly smaller charge in the fourth quarter that I don't recall seeing in the fourth quarter press release. So what is the charge about and are we done with it, or it's just something we need to anticipate in the balance of the year as well? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I'm going to start by saying that, Vincent, it's kind of a one-time item and it's just related to when we make catalyst changes. We look at how much precious metals we have on the books versus what we recover. So it's not something that we do every quarter. Dave, I don't know, if you want to add any more to that. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, Vincent, actually in the fourth quarter, it was a $30 billion (sic) [million] gain and then a $40 million loss in the first quarter. So it was quite a bit of variance quarter-to-quarter, normally, we wouldn't talk about this, but just the variance quarter-to-quarter, we brought it to light. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, it's a fairly big swing from a gain to a loss, but shouldn't expect this is to be recurring. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just, Bob, you mentioned the different grades of polyethylene and sort of the cadence of supply that's coming in those different grades. Could you just talk a little bit about how those grades may compete with each other and what sort of substitutability there might be from one grade to another in certain applications, and how insulated should different grades be from each other as the supply comes online? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, there's very little competition in between the grades. So if you think of \u2013 give you one example \u2013 if you think about metallocene linear low density polyethylene, it really doesn't compete with high density polyethylene for pipe or blow molding, so they are \u2013 the mainstream markets for these products are quite different and the overlap is very minimal. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, the share buyback announcement you have there and trying to connect that with the M&A comment, should I interpret that as there is nothing out there right now that you're all that interested in or am I over-interpreting that? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No. I think if you \u2013 again, what we presented at our Investor Day for M&A was really in the context of thinking through opportunities in cycles. And frankly, given valuations where they are today \u2013 and we don't see a whole lot of opportunity \u2013 and so, our buyback program, we said, we've gone back to shareholders for another 10% and we expect buybacks to be part of our capital deployment strategy. So, on acquisitions, frankly, there's really nothing compelling that we see at the moment. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. If you don't mind, a completely different area, you mentioned methanol has been strong, it's moderating. But if an upset gets you this kind of a price increase, usually means we're fairly tight. What does that mean for octane values? And is there a chance we can actually see MTBE finally go up some in the near future? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I think certainly, when you see this kind of price response, it does indicate markets are more balanced, because I think what we're looking for is, more specifically, gasoline spreads, how we do through the summer. We're relatively constructive about that. And if you think about our I&D business, that combined with relatively lower butane price should drive margin improvement, and we've illustrated where we are here in April. So, Dave, do you want to add something else? David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, Jonas, I think we see this shaping up pretty much as a normal year for MTBE, not like 2015, per se, but more typical with the summer season, unlike what we had in 2016. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : So, 2015 was extremely strong and 2016 was weak, and we think something in between is kind of what we expect here in 2017. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of John Roberts of UBS Technology (sic) [Securities]. Your line is now open. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. The isocyanate market is pretty tight right now, which you don't produce, but it consumed along with propylene oxide. Does that constrain you at all in your propylene oxide sales? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Not too much really, I mean I think we have very long-term off-take agreements on PO and so we're not held back in terms of our production rates because of tight isocyanate markets. We're frankly running our PO assets pretty full today. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : And do you think methanol prices are going to be set by MTO affordability going forward, or do you have a different view at all on methanol prices? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I think MTO certainly plays a very big role in methanol prices as well as, we think, kind of the marginal cost of production for ethylene. So, our belief on that hasn't changed. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from the line of Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple quick follow-ups, how often do you need to do that precious metal catalyst recovery in the I&D segment, how often does that take place? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Good morning, Frank. It's not every quarter. It's once every 18 months or thereabouts. But we have many different units, so I don't think we can give you a guidance on an exact cadence. Thomas, if you want to add anymore to that. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Right. So, as Bob has said, we have many different units, we are talking mainly about gold and silver, both a significant charge. And I would like to reiterate, this is a non-cash charge, the significant non-cash charge we had in the first quarter is related to silver, so it's connected to our EO business. And having said this, expect so. Let me maybe make that very clear how it works. We bought that silver three years ago, so we bought it at market value three years ago and now we replace the silver, we virtually borrowed silver during the maintenance part of the catalyst and so have to readjust the book values, purely non-cash. The next one in the silver area is expected in the next two to three years, so nothing immediate. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Very helpful. And Bob, just coming back to capturing opportunities in cycle, subsequent to the Analyst Day, obviously we saw the sale of a major ethylene facility. Would that have fallen outside of your \"disciplined approach\" or is it just not an area that you want to expand upon inorganically? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I think for now, our focus, Frank, has been on derivatives, so building out our polyethylene. As you know, we've announced a new polyethylene plant, which we will break ground here in May. And the location of the cracker is not near really our assets, it's in Louisiana, where we don't have any ethylene or polyethylene assets. So beyond value, there were other sort of strategic factors that made it less suitable for us. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Terrific. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Good morning. Bob, on slide 10, you called out a number of factors that seem to support the supply side of the ethane market, such as rig count additions and a richer mix. And yet, if we look at the forward curve for ethane about two years out, it's around $0.325 gallon versus $0.245. So up about $0.08 or 30% to 35%, contango. And I'm wondering if you can help us reconcile that, is it a case, for example, that the forward market is just not very deep in ethane, so we shouldn't read much into it or are there other factors that could result in that type of tightening there? Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. Absolutely. I think that's part of what you're seeing is that it is a very thin market, especially as you go further out in time. Secondly, there's a bit of a lag between market pricing and the announcements being sort of confirmed. So, we've read about more fractionation capacity coming. We understand others are considering more fractionation capacity. So, I think there's a bit of a lag from the time that announcements come out to the time where prices reflect more supply. But clearly, we're seeing more supply from the Permian and from the Eagle Ford, and we expect that that should be ample to supply new crackers going forward. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, if I may. Do you happen to have handy a breakdown of the aggregate $250 million maintenance hit for each of your segments? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, we talked about $110 million associated with our co-product processing unit and about $100 million related to the FCC and then the balance was on a sundry of things. But I think those were probably the two big items that we discussed. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Excellent. Thank you. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : And the precious metal catalysts were in there, the $40 million for the first quarter in I&D as well. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Bob, was taking a look at the MTBE volumes. You obviously called out in the press release that there were seasonality obviously. But even on a year-over-year basis, if I take a look at the MTBE, ETBE volumes, they were down almost 11%. So just wanted to sort of figure out what was going on there. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I think that's maybe inventory-related. There's not really a clearer driver for that. I mean we're not producing less, per se. We do have, as I mentioned, the turnaround on our PO/TBA unit in the Netherlands and we started that right at the end of the first quarter. So other than inventory fluctuation, nothing that I could point to Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. Got it. And on a different sort of product side of things, you talked about benefiting a bit in Q1 from higher styrene margins. In April, they came down a bit. Just wanted your views about, be it Q2 or 2017, what your outlook is for styrene in the near term. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think with demand growing at a reasonable pace, not a lot of new capacity globally, we're still in styrene in a very balanced sort of market environment. And I think we'll see these periodic run-ups if there is unplanned outages, or sort of large swings in inventory. But I think it's a market, much like methanol, that's reflecting balanced, or higher operating rates, which are sensitive to unplanned events. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Perfect. Thanks so much, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I got two questions. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: One sort of short term and one long term. In the short term, what are inventories at converters of your customers, and do you believe that they will destock inventory as they see new capacity starting up in second half? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : In terms of inventories at customers, from what we see in terms of rail car turns and things like that, we don't see anything unusual, P.J. I would suspect that inventories are kind of at normal levels. And there is industry data available at the producer level and it points to pretty low inventory. So I would say, if you kind of combine the two together across the PE producer/consumer value chain, likely we're below average in terms of inventories going into a seasonally higher demand period. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. And then we are beginning to see a third wave of ethylene expansion or ethylene capacity announcements for the next decade. And these are serious players like NOVA/Total and Exxon/SABIC. So do they see this ethane availability at from Permian and Eagle Ford that you talked about, do they see that and is that what is driving this new wave of projects? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think, to a degree, it shows conviction about ethane supply beyond the current set of expansions that are coming. But certainly, as you say, as if I read it correctly, I think the Total cracker is not a world scale, it's an extension of their existing cracker. And then, of course, Exxon/SABIC is a world scale cracker. But the P.J., I think as we look at two or three crackers, it's not as much as eight crackers, which I would consider more to be a wave as opposed to two or three which, if you step back and think on a global context, demand grows at a pace where you need about four to five new crackers every year to meet demand growth. But it doesn't seem to be as large of a wave as maybe what we've seen here recently. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. On the PE inventory front, could you also comment on what you're seeing in Asia and if there's still a lot of support for exports, given where inventories might be in that region of the world? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, Jim, in Asia generally, you do see more volatility in the inventory and I think in Asia, what I understand is that they're probably a little bit above average in Asia in terms of inventories. But that gets worked off pretty quickly and again, we're going into, globally, a very seasonally higher demand period in the spring and summer months. So, our view is that export opportunities are there and certainly our production in the U.S. is not limited because of lack of export opportunities. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. And you mentioned butadiene prices are down pretty sharply after their peak. Do you see butadiene prices stabilizing anytime soon? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I think \u2013 first of all \u2013 sort of the spike was a confluence of few events, some planned turnarounds, upcoming, I think, there was pretty good size inventory build especially in Asia. There's still, if you look where we are today, we're still above the kind of levels we were even a year ago. So I think the larger part of the correction seems is behind us and you're seeing now cracker peak slates adjust back to NGLs here in the U.S. which would indicate less butadiene output and propylene output. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. If we could limit things to just one question, so that we can get everybody in before we have to finish here, that would be great. Operator : Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I was hoping to get a little clarification on an answer you gave to just question earlier on the call. If we were to see, hypothetically, polyethylene prices flatten out here in on April and in the second quarter, would you still see some pricing capture benefits? Is that what you' were trying to say? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, yes, so, Ryan compared to Q1, because Q1, the entire quarter didn't include the increases, we were sort of implementing those through the quarter. So, what I was trying to say is that we would see the full impact of the $0.05 and the $0.03 in Q2. Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. But it wasn't designed to mean that there was a delay from the list price change, it was really just kind of a flow-through? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Flow-through, exactly. Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Bob, just on the M&A front. Do you think that asset level or corporate level acquisitions would be more attractive right now? And just overall, maybe you already answered this, but do you feel that there's more opportunities out there compared to six months ago or fewer? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, I think Matthew, first of all, on M&A, it's really about value creation and whether we can kind of apply our strengths to create value. So, I wouldn't limit to either corporate or asset. And so it's really about how we can leverage our platform to create value. More or less, I mean, I think, as I mentioned earlier, today we don't see anything compelling, frankly, just to be clear, valuations are elevated, different products and are different parts of your cycle. And so the whole point of our Investor Day presentation was really to sort of layout a multi-year sort of plan, not a this quarter will we \u2013 may or may not do. And as we think about the next couple, three years, most of our conversations with investors, they've been dominated by the expectation of some sort of cycle. So, really all we attempted to do was frame how we might think about finding opportunities in a potential cycle. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies LLC : Hi. This is Jeff Schnell on for Laurence. Following up on your comments on pricing mismatch and project announcements, and with regard to your potential projects, should we see \u2013 should we expect announcements to be flagged early in the process? Or do you expect them to be announced later to gain timing advantage versus competitors? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : You mean, Jeff, in terms of new cracker announcements? Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies LLC : Yeah any. Yeah, new build. Yeah. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I don't know, it's difficult to say. For us, I think we've clearly stated that we have one more debottleneck we can do at Channelview. We're focused on getting this polyethylene expansion completed by mid-2019, and then we would consider perhaps other polyethylene expansions. So difficult to really, for me, to assess or have a view on other strategies. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay? Okay. Good. Well, I think that was our last question. So, let me conclude with a few closing comments. First of all, thanks, as always, for your thoughtful questions. Markets around the globe remain pretty strong and I think given that we've had a few quarters of heavier planned maintenance, we're really well-positioned for the remainder of 2017 to fully capture opportunities and run our global asset base at full rates. Our strategy remains consistent, strong focus on operational excellence, which means running what we own today very well, deploying the strong free cash flow in a disciplined way, and remunerate shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to build out our organic growth pipeline. We'll also evaluate inorganic growth, as I've discussed, but it's really in the context of finding opportunities in cycles, and we'll have to see kind of how this cycle plays out. But make no mistake that we can \u2013 we'll focus on shareholder value creation and thinking about how we can leverage the platform that we have to create more value. So, with that, thank you for your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you with second quarter results in July. That concludes our call. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, everyone. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining and you may now all disconnect.",

At the request of LyondellBasell, this teleconference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answering session. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Great. Thank you, Carla. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's second quarter 2017 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I would also like for you to note that statements made in this call related to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations.

Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 11 :59 p.m. Eastern Time on August 28, by calling 800-294-5423 in the United States and 402-220-9786 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 2526. During today's call, we will focus on the second quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments for LCM that we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these are adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and declines in prices of raw materials and finished goods inventories in previous periods. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the prior LCM inventory changes. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thanks, Dave. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide four and review the highlights from the second quarter. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share was a record at $2.82 per share. EBITDA was $2 billion. We delivered solid results with three of our five operating segments improving in profitability relative to the first quarter. Our Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment delivered record quarterly earnings in the second quarter with EBITDA improving by more than 30% relative to the first quarter. Our operations ran very well during the second quarter, driving strong volume growth within our global Olefins & Polyolefins business and our refinery. We completed planned maintenance at our Botlek PO/TBA site in the Netherlands and our Channelview methanol unit in Texas. Overall, planned maintenance impacted second quarter results by approximately $70 million. We continued to execute on our financial priorities during the second quarter and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments. Slide five reflects the leading safety performance that our employees and contractors continue to achieve during the second quarter of this year. While our goal remains to prevent all injuries, I'm happy to report that LyondellBasell's safety performance continues to be among the best in our industry. As many of you know, we believe that our focus and discipline around the health, safety and environmental performance translates to strong operational reliability and ultimately, profitability. Slide 5/6 illustrates our strong second quarter performance, with operating rates of 98% of nameplate capacity across our U.S. and European ethylene crackers. Our polyethylene production operated at 95% of capacity. And I'm particularly pleased to report the rebound in performance at our Houston refinery, where crude throughput rates increased to an average of 99% of capacity during the second quarter. The combination of this strong operational performance and consistent cost management provide the foundation for our results. Let's turn to slide seven and review how our U.S. ethylene expansions are allowing us to leverage these advantages across a larger asset base during 2017. Slide seven describes the progress of this growth program over the past four years. During 2013 and 2015, smaller projects in Clinton, Iowa and Channelview, Texas increased ethylene capacity with little disruption to existing production. However, the 2014 expansion in La Porte and the 2016 Corpus Christi project both required significant maintenance outages of existing capacity. As a result, the full effect of our 2 billion-pound growth program has not been fully realized until 2017. Let's turn to slide eight and review how our high-reliability, lighter maintenance schedule and increased capacity delivered increased production volumes during the first half of 2017. After completing four major ethylene cracker maintenance turnarounds during 2016, we have none scheduled for this year. This increased ethylene production enables us to run our downstream ethylene derivative units at higher rates. And with planned maintenance at the refinery completed during the first quarter, we look for the strong second-quarter rates to continue. With all of this year's major planned maintenance complete, we are well-positioned to deliver strong volume growth during the second half of 2017. And now, Thomas will discuss our financial highlights. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Bob, and good morning to all of you. On slide nine, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. As Bob mentioned, three of our five business segments improved relative to their first quarter 2017 performance. During the quarter, strong ethylene co-product pricing and reduced feedstock costs benefited our Olefins & Polyolefins segments. The refinery ran very well at nearly full capacity. However, unusually small discounts for heavy crude oil restrained margins and negatively impacted profitability. Please turn to slide 10, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of cash from operations, and about half of this amount was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Our investments in maintenance and growth capital expenses were $407 million during the second quarter, driven by maintenance turnarounds and the Hyperzone PE and PO/TBA projects. During the second quarter, our cash and liquid investments balance increased by approximately $400 million. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.3 billion of cash from operations and used approximately $3.2 billion for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program and other financial activities, the cash and liquid investment balance has remained relatively unchanged. Slide 11 provides a longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. We finished the quarter with approximately $5.4 billion of liquidity and a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times. Our share repurchase program continues during the quarter with another 5.4 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have now repurchased approximately 186 million shares, or approximately 32% of the initial shares outstanding. Our second quarter activity shows that share repurchases continue to have a role in our capital deployment strategy. Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that might help you modeling of our company. Excluding the first quarter bond redemption charges, we are maintaining our previous annual guidance provided in February for capital, interest, depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as our effective tax rate. With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob. Thank you very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 12 and review our segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory changes. In our Olefins & Polyolefin Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $859, a $136 million improvement over the first quarter. The first quarter included a $31 million gain from the sale of property in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Relative to the previous quarter, Olefins results improved by approximately $100 million, primarily due to a $0.03 per pound improvement in ethylene margins. Ethylene operating rates remained strong across our system during the quarter, averaging 97%. Our Corpus Christi ethylene plant operated at 88% of the expanded capacity during the second quarter. 75% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 88% from NGLs. In Polyolefins combined results improved by approximately $80 million. Polyethylene spreads improved approximately $0.04 per pound due to an ethylene monomer price decrease and higher polymer prices. Polypropylene spreads improved approximately $0.05 per pound, primarily due to decreased monomer pricing. During July, spot ethylene prices have decreased due to strong industry supply and increased inventories. After relatively light spring maintenance season, consulting services are predicting a return to typical levels of per-planned maintenance for September and October. Polyethylene markets are balanced, while polypropylene demand is relatively strong. No major maintenance is planned in our olefin system for the remainder of 2017. Let's turn to slide 13 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, EBITDA was a record $699 million, $179 million higher than the first quarter. Olefins results improved by approximately $135 million, primarily due to lower feedstock costs. Utilization of advantaged feedstocks increased by 5%. Our crackers operated at 100% of their nameplate capacity during the second quarter, exceeding the industry average performance by 14 percentage points. Combined Polyolefin results improved by approximately $15 million, primarily due to improved polypropylene margins. During July, global markets remained balanced, with good demand. As in the U.S., no major maintenance is planned in our European olefins system for the remainder of 2017. Now please turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $339 million, unchanged from the first quarter. Excluding first quarter charges related to the recovery of precious metals, results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $5 million, primarily due to planned maintenance in our PO/TBA plant in the Netherlands. After excluding precious metal adjustments from the first quarter, intermediate chemicals results declined by approximately $30 million, as styrene margins declined and methanol volumes were reduced due to planned maintenance. Oxyfuels and related products results were relatively unchanged with seasonal margin improvements offsetting volume declines due to planned maintenance at our Botlek, Netherlands facility. We successfully completed our planned maintenance on this PO/TBA facility and the Channelview methanol plant, which impacted second quarter earnings by $50 million and $20 million respectively. Now let's move to slide 15 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $25 million, a $55 million improvement over the prior quarter. Operationally, we had a great quarter, with crude operating rates at 99% of nameplate capacity. With higher volumes, the cost of RINs increased relative to the first quarter. As Thomas mentioned, weak heavy-to-light crude differentials limited profitability from our strong operations. Our Technology segment continued to perform well, with $48 million of EBITDA, a $12 million decline versus the first quarter, due to the timing of catalyst shipments to customers. Let's move to slide 16 and review some important milestones for our organic growth program. In May, we began construction on our 1.1 billion-pound Hyperzone high-density polyethylene plant in La Porte, Texas. The new plant will increase our ability to capture the full chain margin benefits of our expanded ethylene capacity. And our innovative Hyperzone polyethylene process technology will produce differentiated polyethylene products and provide a new platform for licensing through our technology segment. The plant is scheduled to start in 2019. Last Friday, we announced the final investment decision to build the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant. This plant represents the single largest capital investment by our company to date. Our leading PO/TBA technology and shale-based feedstocks provides us with a durable advantage to serve growing global markets for urethanes and oxyfuels. Construction will begin during 2018 and the plant will be completed in 2021. We look forward to talking with you over the coming quarters about additional developments in building a sustainable pipeline of value-added organic growth for the company. Turning to slide 17; the second quarter developed largely as we anticipated. We had record earnings of $2.82 per share as well as record profitability in Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International. Our 2016 investments in maintenance and capacity expansions are delivering strong operating rates and ethylene production improvements of 17% in O&P Americas, 11% in O&P EAI during the first half of 2017. With the completion of planned maintenance in our Refining segment, we increased crude throughput by 24% relative to the first half of last year. Looking forward, we continue to see good olefin and polyolefin market demand supporting strong global operating rates over the near term. While strong industry operations and delays in new derivatives capacity have recently pressured spot ethylene margins in the United States, global demand for polyolefins remains strong and supportive of chain margins for both our shale-based and naphtha-based production assets around the world. We continue to see U.S. supply and inventories of natural gas and NGL feedstocks remaining abundant, and we're encouraged by increased production, transportation, and fractionation investments near the U.S. Gulf Coast. In fuel markets, we're encouraged by improving demand, but remain cautious on the impact of range-bound crude oil prices on our oxyfuels business and weak discounts for heavy crudes processed by our Refining segment. We have no major planned maintenance across our global system for the remainder of 2017. With that, I'm pleased to now take your questions. Carla, we're ready to take questions now. Operator : Thank you. Our first question came from the line of Mr. Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : ...statement. So you're saying more than 25% of the first wave of new ethylene capacity is in the market. Assuming that includes your own brownfield additions, that would be my first question. And then secondly, what's the cadence you see for the rest of the capacity coming on? And what do you think will happen with margins as that comes on in both North America as well as Europe? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Arun. I missed the very first few words of your question, but I think what you're asking was, the first 25%, does it include our brownfield? And the answer is yes, it does. The pace of the new capacity expansions over the next 12 to 18 months are well-documented in a lot of places and we still think that by one quarter or so, polyethylene capacity is phased earlier than crackers. So we still think that's still the case in the second half. And then the rest of the ethylene capacity will come online over the period of the next 12 to 18 months. In terms of impact on margins, certainly that's the nature of our business and we've talked about a modest or a shallow cycle here. So we would expect some margin volatility going into these next 12 to 18 months as these new units come on because of their size and as we trend towards the new normal of higher exports out of the U.S. But as far as the cycle goes, Arun, we continue to believe that this looks to us to be a fairly shallow and narrow cycle in terms of its duration. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just as far as polyethylene goes, the industry announced an increase for July that some have pushed to August. What's your read on potential success for that increased initiative? And you'd made some comments on inventories. So maybe you can just relate the inventory and demand side to your comments on the potential success of that increase? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes, I think markets are still relatively balanced here in the U.S. and globally. And so, as evidenced by initial reports of the rollover on polyethylene price here in July, I won't hazard a forecast on the future. But I think we're going into the second half of the year with pretty balanced markets and demand growing at a good pace globally. So I think that whatever lies ahead we're going into it with very strong operating rates and very constructive markets. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Stephen Byrne of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, thank you. Bob, you had just mentioned there about exports being the primary target for a lot of this new polyethylene capacity. I was wondering if you were seeing any of it targeting any of your legacy U.S. polyethylene customers, either from this new wave that's on now or any preselling from capacity not yet onstream. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. We have not seen any significant impact in terms of local market dynamics. But still, the capacity hasn't come online. So I think we'll have to see how all this plays out. But so far, we've had a cracker and derivatives come online in Mexico, and that's in the market today. And we haven't seen a lot of impact from that. So far, I think it's early. So I don't want to, again, predict too much here. But it seems to me that exports are the destination for a lot of this new output that will come out of these new plants. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. And do you see opportunities for more consolidation in the olefin and polyolefin industry? What would be your interest level in participating in that, say, versus diversifying your platform into more downstream derivatives or into new base chemistries? What would be your preferences in that, in those buckets? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, when we think about inorganic growth, if you will. We first of all think about what creates the most value and how can we leverage our strengths. And so, our strengths, we continue to believe, are in the safe, reliable cost-efficient operations. And I think certainly, given our base in olefins and polyolefins, if there were value-creating opportunities that were compelling, they could be of interest. And for the rest, I think we've discussed in many different forms that unlikely that we would pursue real specialty businesses. We would want to stay close to our core and leverage these strengths that I've described. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Very good. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question came from the line of Mr. Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Over the past month, natural gas has been flat-to-lower. Ethane is probably moved up from, I don't know, $0.23 a gallon to $0.26. Do you see anything in that? I realize that there can be a lot of volatility in these numbers, but it seems that the trend is, for ethane, moving up and natural gas moving down. What do you make of that? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I don't see anything specific that's driving that today. We step back and we look at the amount of ethane production; it continues to remain strong. Inventories are on the high end of the range. So you know, sometimes these price movements are just kind of what's happening at the moment in terms of logistics or local inventories near where crackers are. So far, we don't draw any conclusion from this recent diversion between ethane price and natural gas. Again, I come back to, I think there's still an abundance of ethane and plenty of it close to the Gulf Coast. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : For my follow-up, on slide 16, you have a potential EBITDA from your propylene oxide TBA new unit. And in the old days, I think you used to size the potential EBITDA as $300 million to $400 million, and now you've got $450 million to $550 million, though you footnote it and say it's a 2012, 2016 average margin. Has your view about the potential EBITDA of that unit changed? Or this is just a different guess? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : So Jeff, it hasn't changed. We just looked over a longer period of time, 4 years, which incorporates a variety of market conditions. So we've had 2015, which was one of the best years in that business and 2016 was on the low end. So you know, as we've sort of span the range of outcomes. And so no real change in our long-term outlook of the oxyfuels business. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : If the current environment was the environment that, that plant came on, would $300 million to $400 million be the right number? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No, we'd certainly be in the $400 million sort of range in the current market environment. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you so much, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Sir, your line is now open. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks. Bob, a couple of months ago, the view was that ethylene would, supply would be tight as derivative units started ahead of the new crackers. Instead, I think you've notably seen spot prices decline quite significantly. Is this due to delays in the derivative capacity? Or is it more just better operations? And how would you see these ethylene prices unfolding as we move into Q3, the rest of Q3 and Q4. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Don, I think it's a combination of both. I think incrementally, this new polyethylene capacity has been delayed a month or two, that's our impression. And on the operating side, certainly, U.S. industry has run quite well through the summer. But now we are coming into September, October where there's relatively high planned maintenance schedule. I would anticipate that during that period, some of this new polyethylene capacity will come online. So both of those trends will sort of reverse. And we continue to think that through 2017 as derivative units are phased ahead of crackers, we think ethylene should be constructive through year-end. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Then a follow-up on Europe. You had very strong, I think, record quarterly EBITDA in EAI. You often don't seem to get much credit for your European operations. What is the sustainability of this strength? Is this more just a function of relatively low oil to NGL prices? Or is it more sustainable than that? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. I appreciate you pointing out that we don't always get credit for that. As you know, I was over there during the more darker days in that business. And I think, first of all, I'm really proud of the results that our team over there is delivering. There's a few factors. Early in the decade we made a lot of change that I think structurally improved the earnings potential of that segment. We took out fixed costs. We improved the feed slate and we improved our market positioning. I think those things are structural that have improved the underlying performance of that segment which are internal improvements. The market has also improved as operating rates have increased. There's not really been any new capacity that's been added in the past few years and none anticipated in the next, at least, couple of years. So demand has started to grow again. Weak Euro, lower oil price environment. I think all those things are constructive to the EAI segment. Now, as the new U.S. capacity comes online, we would expect that the EAI results would moderate some. But clearly, in my mind, there's a new level, given changes in oil to gas, Euro and then our own internal changes which we made. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Could you guys talk a little about what the volatility in RINs prices did either in the quarter, or what may do in the future, and how it affects your refinery profits? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : RINs prices, Bob, went up a little bit here in Q2. And I think we have to wait to see how the regulatory environment evolves. Dave, maybe if you want to add a little bit more into that. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes, Bob. There's been a lot of volatility in the RINs prices and I think we've seen higher RINs costs for the company during the second quarter as we had higher throughput through the refinery. But as you know, there's a lot of talk around the renewable fuel obligation and we're waiting to see what the administration has to say about that, so there's a lot of speculation in the market right now. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And if I might, Bob. Could you talk a little about, you mentioned trying to keep close to your core competencies here in terms of doing any acquisitions, or maybe going further downstream. How far downstream would you go? We heard a pretty impassioned discussion from Dow yesterday about how much value they get added by going cracker plus 9. We heard from Eastman this morning talking about vertical integration helping them in downstream. So how far would you be willing to go downstream? And then secondly, you guys aren't all that big in Asia. Is there any appetite for doing \u2013 and getting larger over in Asia? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : So Bob, first of all, downstream. The way I think about it is, when you get really far downstream you start to compete in various fragmented markets that have many competitors, and the scale becomes smaller. For us, I think it's sticking to large-scale assets, large markets, and where operational efficiency costs, competitiveness create value. And even within that, we do have differentiated products like our polypropylene compounding business, and Catalloy and so on. So if you would consider that downstream, then I think we're certainly interested in that and we participate in that today. Unlikely we would get into the polyethylene conversion business. Now, that's a different kind of business and in prior lives, I've even seen the pipe business downstream and some mixed results. So I think it's really sticking to large-scale assets and not going so far downstream that we're competing in fragmented markets that have a very different competitive structure. In terms of Asia, I step back and think about feedstock advantages being an important driver for our investment decisions. And clearly, in the ethylene chain, the U.S. is more favorable to us than Asia. As we move into C3-C4 chains, certainly Asia could be interesting. Today we participate through joint ventures. And it's possible that we could expand within those joint ventures which are very \u2013 we have great partners and strong positions that we could build upon to participate in the local markets in Asia in C3 and C4 chains. And of course, we have a joint venture in propylene oxide in China, which we could build upon. So I think all those things are under consideration, and we just need to think through what drives value in terms of where we place our asset. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: >: Got it, thanks very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Sir, your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: As oil prices ran up last year then dropped earlier this year, what is the mentality of converters in their purchasing patterns? Are they reluctant to build inventories because of this volatility or because of the new crackers starting up? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : P.J., I think converter inventories, their bias has been to keep lower inventories, especially after what happened in 2008. So I think that structurally changed how people think about inventory. I would say probably most importantly in the psyche of the customers, my sense is that the expected new capacity probably has them leaning towards the low side on inventories with what's expected in the second half. So I think we'll just have to see how these units start up and the timing of those units. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then with oil prices between $40 and $50, what changes are you making to Europe, feed slate in Europe in terms of LPGs versus condensates versus naphtha? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : In Europe, to the extent that we can purchase propane and condensates at a discount to naphtha, we continue to seek those opportunities and we're finding them. Especially in the summer months, we tend to find propane is more economical. So incrementally, we continue to push for ways to get non-naphtha feed into our crackers. And we're having some success, and we continue to push the envelope on that. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And one quick one on Hyperzone polyethylene plant. Is this technology tested, or what's the technology risk here? And in your EBITDA forecast, do you assume a price premium for Hyperzone PE versus regular PE? Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : So this technology, we actually practice an analogous technology in polypropylene today, so it is a proven technology in polyolefins. We've modified it to apply to polyethylene. It in fact does have the potential to produce differentiated products. Without getting overly technical, it's a multi-modal process, so we can make products that essentially allow our customers to reduce part weight, consume less polyethylene per part, and offer better strength in some cases. So we do expect some premiums, and that's what we've assumed in our modeling. But I would say we've done a lot of product development work and some test trials with some of our customers, and those have proven out the characteristics of the polyethylene that we expect to produce. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning, everyone. China has reduced its importation of recycled polyethylene by about 50% since oil peaked in 2014. And the, earlier this week, or last week I guess, they filed with the WTO to ban importation of recycled polyethylene. So I just want to get your thoughts on what impact do you think that could have to the supply and demand balance of the overall market as we head into 2018. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Vincent, I think directionally that's a positive in terms of global operating rates. We'll just have to see if that recycled material ends up elsewhere. But to your point, at lower oil prices generally, recycled materials make less economic sense compared to what they did when oil price was $100. So I think directionally it's positive in terms of operating rates. We'll just have to see how it plays out. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up, as we think about 2018 and potential turnaround activity, should we be just assuming a normal year at this point or two years after 2016, will it be something more expansive? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No, 2016, we had a fairly significant amount of catch-up we needed to do. We had seven or so very large planned turnarounds. Our normal cadence is three to five, and you should expect three to five now for the coming years, and we'll phase it that way. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Vincent, I think we have two crackers on slate for next year, and one of the PO units and one of the trains at the refinery. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Could we please limit questions to just one question, so that we can get through everybody in the queue? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Sir, your line is now open. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Good morning, guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Congratulations to finally getting that PO/TBA off the drawing board. I'm very excited. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So I hope you don't mind, David. There's a couple of questions on this PO/TBA. The first one is, I'm assuming it's intending all for exports, since you're already exporting today. And the question is really where will those cargos land? Is there a risk that we will have to accept a lower PO price, we have to go further away? And then as a secondary question on this, chlorine prices have been up across the globe. How much benefit do you think there is to PO from chlorine, if chlorine keeps rising? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : So on PO exports, first of all, we do not plan to export much of this capacity at all. In fact, we've already entered into some long-term agreements to place a reasonable amount of that volume today. And we would expect that most of the propylene outside that will be produced from this plant in 2021 will be placed in the domestic market and into downstream urethane markets and so on. So I don't expect a lot of that. In terms of exports, if it does go export, normally we export to Europe and Asia, and we have a system in Europe which we can plug into and supplement. So I don't expect that to be a drag on the project returns. In terms of chlorine, as chlorine prices rise, and if you think about our technology, we have a co-product that benefits U.S. natural gas or NGL advantage, because we're upgrading U.S.-based butane, which is priced more off of gas rather than oil, up to MTBE. So I think that favors the economics of this PO/TBA project, and given the scale we have, it should be very low cost, but I think it'd be very competitive globally. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That makes sense. Now the point on chlorine is that's the marginal production technology, so if chlorine keeps going up. That should be beneficial, but I don't know how much? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes, exactly. Directionally, you're right, and it's difficult to predict how much chlorine will rise. But, yes, we're well-positioned in terms of the cost curve with this technology. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: On polypropylene, back in June, Braskem announced a large new plant in the U.S. As a market leader, why wasn't the next new plant in North America yours as opposed to Braskem's? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : That's a good question, David. I ask my team that often. You know, I think, look we were working on ethylene debottlenecks. We were working on the Hyperzone polyethylene plant, PO/TBA, and, frankly, you know, we're ramping up our resource and our capability to do several capital projects at one time. And so, I think it's a very logical sort of next step for us to consider polypropylene, and even perhaps propylene in the U.S., so stay tuned. Nothing today really to discuss, but it's certainly on our mind. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Instinet. Sir, your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : Good morning. Thank you. At your Investor Day, you talked about several projects to extend ethylene and polyethylene beyond the current La Porte HDPE project. Has your level of interest in those further expansions, especially downstream in polyethylene increased since then? Have those projects advanced? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. So, Aleksey, in terms of organic growth, beyond the PP and propylene-related investment that we might consider, we still have one more debottleneck we can do at our Channelview cracker. In fact, we delayed that in 2015 in preference for the Hyperzone polyethylene plant to make sure that our merchant position doesn't grow further. So our plan is to execute that debottleneck, which will come in two phases, early in the next decade. And it would be very logical then to build polyethylene to consume that ethylene to maintain kind of a merchant ethylene position of something like 15%. So I suspect that as we work through the next decade, we'll do these two debottlenecks, which total about 550 million pounds at Channelview, both of them combined, and then another polyethylene unit behind that. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Sir, your line is now open. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes, good morning. Bob, within the last week or so there have been some headlines emanating from Europe whereby competition authorities have paid a visit to a few different purchasers of ethylene in that market. Do you have any insights as to what's going on there? And as a manufacturer of ethylene, does Lyondell stand to benefit in any way? Perhaps you could educate us a bit on how monomer is sold locally in Europe? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think it's not a whole lot different than how it's sold here in the U.S. And we weren't approached. So, I don't know all of the details around the nature of their inquiries, but my impression, having worked in both regions is that it was very similar in both regions in how the market functions, and how buyers and sellers negotiate price. So at this moment, Kevin, I don't expect some sort of an impact, one way or the other in terms of the ethylene market over in Europe. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question came from the line of Mr. John Roberts of UBS. Sir, your line is now open. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Back to the question on the PO plant. Do we need to see some isocyanate expansions announced to be able to absorb that propylene oxide? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I would say for two-thirds of it, not really. We've already \u2013 we have anticipation of demand and because it's out in 2021, I would suspect that we'll see some announcements as the next couple of years progress. So we've done a lot of work around placement of the PO and given the rate that markets are growing and the conversations we've had with some of our key customers, we think that we'll be able to place most, if not, all of it here in the U.S. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Carla, can we move to the next caller? Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Company. Sir, your line is now open. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. Could you share with us your outlook for naphtha prices in Asia, and whether you think that crude oil prices are helping the naphtha-based production in that region? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I think in Asia, naphtha still is a very large source of ethylene production. And I think with low oil prices, certainly naphtha has become more competitive. I think with Asia, we continue to believe that as time goes on, methanol-based olefin production will be more relevant in terms of price setting. About half of the new capacity that's planned for ethylene in Asia, and specifically in China, will come from MTO or CTO. And so we think that the more relevant marker will be MTO-based economics, as it has been recently, but as it becomes bigger and bigger, even with slightly lower operating rates. We think MTO will be in the money and will determine the marginal cost of production. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Sir, your line is now open. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Hey, good morning, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Bob, just wanted to revisit a couple of comments you made about EAI, and your feedstock slate there and the like. On the nearer-time side as well as the medium-term side. So and the premise of this question basically is that, at least as I see it, naphtha prices seem to be coming down on much harder than oil prices, right? Again, as I take a look at the sort of naphtha to oil ratio, it seems to have compressed quite dramatically relative to yesteryears. So the nearer-time question basically is, that Q1 to Q2 was there a meaningful change in your feedstock slate as far as EAI go? Lesser or more amounts of LPG used? So that's the nearer-time part. And the medium-term part is that if at all this new relationship that I'm talking about, meaning a compressed naphtha to crude oil ratio, does continue or does linger on, would it not be sort of more economic just to use naphtha rather than sort of doing the switch over to LPG? I mean just, your medium-term thoughts about this new phenomenon would be appreciated? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. Excellent question. So the first question about Q2 and LPG cracking, it's incrementally, a little bit more LPG cracking, but not significant. So I would not consider that to be an unusual step up in LPG cracking. If there's some seasonality, generally in the summer months, we crack a bit more LPG. But it was not unusual. Your point around naphtha, I think, it's a very good one, is that naphtha cracks have actually been pretty good and naphtha price relative to oil was somewhat strong in the past couple of years. And now it's kind of \u2013 it's again going back to a more historical relationship, or even weaker. Simply put, the way we try to buy non-naphtha feed is there's a discount to the naphtha price. So if we can't get a firm advantage in the price mechanism, then we likely wouldn't buy it. And we would make the decision at the time. And to your point, to the extent we're not able to do that, then we would just crack naphtha and capture that. So the advantage has to be firm for us to crack LPG. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Understood. Very helpful, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is now open. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you, and good morning, and congrats on the record quarter. I was going to ask you if you guys are doing this call from the bat-cave because of the echo that's involved, but Dave was limiting me to one question, so I'm going to have to follow-up on that later on. Bob, you mentioned that Corpus Christi ran at 88% during the second quarter. I was wondering if you could parse that for us as the quarter progressed. And more importantly, where is that facility running through the month of July? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, first of all, thanks for your compliments about our quarter, and we're calling from a conference room, not the bat-cave. Corpus Christi, so we were ramping up in Q2. I think we had mentioned in Q1 earnings that we have some maintenance we needed to do. And so we've completed that. Today, the cracker is running in the mid to upper 90s% in terms of operating rate. As many new investments go, there's some teething that you find, and we have to correct small things. So we've basically materially increased the size of just about every piece of equipment in that plant. And so as we work through that, we find different things that we need to adjust. But we would expect that as the quarter progresses, we would run pretty close to 100% over at Corpus. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes, Frank, we have completed the rate tests at Corpus, so we have demonstrated the full capabilities of the expansion, and it's just normal operational issues over the past few weeks here. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Terrific, thanks so much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering. Sir, your line is now open. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on polypropylene. Is there any pent-up margin expansion potential in the U.S., given that the inventories have been falling and sales have been pretty strong, yet you've seen spreads between polypropylene and propylene remain flat for the past, I don't know, nine months or so? And then also, it looks like there's been a fair amount of planned polypropylene expansions canceled either in China or other places of the world. Are you getting more optimistic on polypropylene margins going forward? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Matt. Thanks for your question. I think some very astute observations. First of all, yes. In the near term, inventories are quite low, as reported by different publications, so we have a $0.03 price increase announcement out for the coming month. So our sense is that the polypropylene market is very balanced, tight, and depending on the time of the year, and we would expect that to continue. And as I mentioned earlier in one of the other questions, it's part of our assessment in terms of our organic growth program going forward. So we do see \u2013 we see some of the cancelations that you mentioned and we're very constructive about polypropylene for the coming few years. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. A question about the balance sheet. Given the optimism you have about the structural dynamics in the industry, the breadth of the projects that you have in your potential pipeline for review, and the broader or deeper engineering talent to be able to handle more projects, has there been any shift in how you're thinking about the amount of leverage you'd like to take on, either on a mid-cycle basis or on a trough basis, in order to take advantage of those opportunities? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think so in the near term. Our view as we had expressed in Investor Day as well that we think we can continue to fund organic growth from our operating cash flow, given the level of cash flow we generate quarter after quarter. So I don't think we're going to necessarily need to avail ourselves of balance sheet capacity to undertake more organic growth. Essentially, I think the balance sheet is something we would use to undertake inorganic growth should we find the right opportunity. So our approach has not changed. It's more just a tilt towards organic growth as we find these opportunities to create shareholder value. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question came from the line of Mr. Marvin Schwartz of Neuberger Berman. Sir, your line is now open. Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman Group LLC : Thank you. It would make me very happy if you really put on the back burner any thought of acquisition of any meaningful consequence because you have a major alternative, and it's buying back more of your own stock. You've taken your shares from 575 million shares in the first quarter of 2013 down to the current level of 397,000 (sic) [397 million] shares. But in the last six months you have really throttled back on the buyback. Now your stock sells at one of the lowest price/earnings multiples of any company on the New York Stock Exchange. One of the reasons is that there is a lot of concern about your 2018 earnings outlook, whether with the increase in industry-wide ethylene, you can continue to have up and what I think is likely to be record earnings, but others may disagree with that. But my more specific question is why not accelerate your share buyback program? After all, a few months ago you did announce your fourth 10% share buyback. Why don't you implement it more aggressively and it would help to assure that you'll have an improved earnings per share year in 2018? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Marvin, and thank you for your question. I frankly had expected this question to come up much earlier in the Q&A, so thanks for the question. Let me talk a little bit broadly about our share repurchase program and how we think about it. First of all, share repurchase continues to be part of our capital allocation strategy in our plan. You see that we bought back shares in Q2. We've shown in various forums that our cash deployment priorities, they haven't changed. They're very consistent. It's to pay a strong dividend. We're going to continue to invest in maintenance of our existing assets. We're going to invest in profitable organic growth, and we still have excess cash, which we have dedicated to share repurchase. I think there are two things, Marvin, that have changed in terms of share repurchase. First of all, when you think back to our first one or two \u2013 or actually the first two or three 10% programs, we funded those with about 6% to 7% of the 10% from operating cash flow, and then we incrementally added debt to supplement. One of the things we've said recently is that we would not add debt to supplement buybacks. We would take the excess cash flow, and then we would dedicate that towards buybacks. The other thing we changed is that we're much more opportunistic in terms of our buyback program. And I think in Q2, it really showed some of the benefit of doing that because we could stretch our buyback dollars further and buy back more shares. So we're more opportunistic. But we continue to believe, as you do, that we're undervalued. And it's sort of, how do we stretch this 5% to 6% or so that we can do from our operating cash flow to buy the most shares possible? So frankly, Marvin, I don't think anything has changed, and we continue to see acquiring ourselves as a very good alternative when we think about deploying our cash flow and we'll continue to do that. So, Thomas, I don't know if you wanted to add any more to that in terms of buybacks. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No. The only thing I would add. Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman Group LLC : No, thank you very much. The truth of the matter is, if you added $500 million or even $1 billion to your total current debt, it wouldn't materially change the basic picture of your strong financial condition. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : This is Thomas Aebischer speaking. You're absolutely right with your comment about the size, if you use the size of $1 billion. However, buying back shares is an investment position like any other. And as Bob has mentioned, we are trying to create as much value as possible with our program. We have a 10% approved program, and we are executing this as we go forward. And you have seen, we have clearly increased our buybacks as the opportunities came across in the second quarter of 2017. So the capital deployment hierarchy really hasn't changed to what we have communicated over the last few months. Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman Group LLC : Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you for your question, Marvin. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : There being no other questions, let me close with a few thoughts. In the second half of 2017, we'll continue with our unrelenting focus on safe, reliable, and reliable operations, and a disciplined approach to costs. I think all of these things will deliver differential results for you, our shareholders. With no major planned maintenance for the remainder of this year, and a more typical cadence of about four turnarounds this year, we're well-positioned to capture market opportunities. So with that, thank you for your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you in October. With that, our call is adjourned. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With that being said, I would now like to turn the call all over to Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thanks, Dave. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide three and review the highlights from the third quarter. Our third quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.67. EBITDA was $1.8 billion. Our global business portfolio demonstrated continued strength with EBITDA from our Intermediates & Derivatives segment improving by more than 30% during the third quarter relative to the third quarter of 2016. We advanced our growth strategy by opening a new polypropylene compounds plant in China, and reaching final investment decision for our next propylene oxide plant in Texas. The sale of our interest in the Geosel pipeline and storage facility in France resulted in an after-tax gain of $103 million, which impacted earnings by $0.26 per share. We continue to execute on our financial priorities during the third quarter and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments. Turning to slide four, I'm pleased to report that LyondellBasell's employees and contractors continue to stay focused upon workplace safety during 2017. Third quarter year-to-date metrics compare favorably to both industry benchmarks and our own historical performance. The value of our disciplined approach to safety was evident in the response by our workforce during Hurricane Harvey, one of the worst natural disasters in Texas' history. Despite extensive personal, community and industrial disruption, LyondellBasell had zero major process safety incidents in the areas affected by the storm. Our team overcame difficult conditions and countless obstacles to ensure a safe and secure operations of our clients. I'm personally grateful to our colleagues for their tremendous selflessness, dedication and sense of ownership during this event. Hurricane Harvey affected each of our nine major U.S. Gulf Coast sites by varying degrees. Except for our La Porte ethylene cracker, all facilities were operating by the end of September. Our La Porte cracker had an unplanned shutdown due to the storm that damaged the compressor and distillation tower. I'm pleased to report that this cracker is producing ethylene as of this morning and we will ramp up to full rates over the next days. While we still have a few raw material allocations from suppliers, all other production units are now operating at typical rates. We estimate that lost sales volume valued at third quarter margins and additional related cost due to the storm impacted third quarter results by approximately $200 million. Tight markets for many of our products resulted in improved margins that provided partial offsets. During the fourth quarter, we estimate that additional lost sales and expenses from the storm, primarily related to the La Porte outage will impact results by approximately $100 million. Let's turn to slide five and review our progress towards increasing production volumes during 2017. You'll recall that during 2016. We had an unusually-high level of plant maintenance, capacity expansions and other work that led to downtime on many of our assets. Even after the impact of Harvey, this year we have produced 13% more ethylene across our global system than in 2016. This increased ethylene production enables us to run our downstream polyethylene and ethylene upside derivative units at higher rates. At our refinery, crude throughput is up by 21% relative to 2016 with only minimal impact from the storm. These volume improvements are contributing to the increased EBITDA in our third quarter results. On slide six, I'd like to review typical seasonality for polyethylene demand in North America, and how the cadence of capacity additions might play out over the coming months. Over the previous seven years, first quarter PE demand in North America improved by an average of 3%, as customers restock after depleting inventories at year-end. Demand typically stayed strong over the second quarter and steps up another 3% in the third quarter to serve increased demand for products consumed during the year-end holiday season. Fourth quarter is typically a period of reduced demand when customers seek to minimize inventories and associated year-end taxes. This seasonal demand pattern is similar to the behavior of global markets where the 4% annual average for polyethylene demand growth is primarily focused in the first three quarters of the year. During the fourth quarter of 2017, several of the long anticipated North American polyethylene capacity additions are becoming a reality for the market. The new capacity is likely to exceed global demand growth by a few percent, but it arrives at a time when global operating rates are very high. With Harvey reducing inventories across the industry during the last third \u2013 2017 and with increasing seasonal demand during the first three quarters of 2018, we believe the market is well positioned to absorb the new capacity over the next few quarters. And now Thomas will provide detail on our financial highlights. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Bob, and good morning to all of you. On slide seven we outline our quarterly and trailing 12-months segment results. During the third quarter Olefins & Polyolefins Americas volumes were impacted by Hurricane Harvey, while high industry operating rates compressed olefin margins due to higher feedstock costs and weaker pricing for much of the quarter. Olefins & Polyolefins EAI continue to benefit from strong demand for polymers that was impacted by reduced olefin margins, primarily due to lower co-product pricing. Our Intermediates & Derivatives segment benefited from strong volumes and margin across most products. The refinery run well throughout the quarter and had a relatively small throughput impact during Harvey. Strong September refining margins improved third quarter profitability relative to the second quarter and 2016 results. Overall, our profitability remained strong with $6.8 billion in EBITDA over the past 12 months. Please turn to slide 8, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of cash from operations and more than 40% of this amount was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Our investments in maintenance and growth capital expenses were $380 million during the third quarter, with increased spending for the Hyperzone PE and PO/TBA projects. During the third quarter, our cash and liquid investments balance increased by approximately $500 million. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.4 billion of cash from operations and used approximately $2.7 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Slide 9 provides a longer perspective, as well as some current financial metrics. We finished the quarter with approximately $6 billion of liquidity and a total debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.3 times. Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 3.1 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we had repurchased approximately 189 million shares, or approximately 33% of the initial shares outstanding. We continue to take a targeted approach to share repurchases as part of our capital deployment strategy. I'm pleased to announce that on September 22, Standard & Poor's raised the rating of LyondellBasell's senior unsecured debt to BBB+ from BBB. Excluding the first quarter bond redemption charges, we continued to maintain our previous annual guidance provided in February for interest, depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as our effective tax rate. We now estimate that our capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $200 million less than our initial guidance of $2 billion. I look forward to providing you with annual guidance for 2018 during our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, thank you very much for your attention. I will now turn the call back to Bob. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 10 and review our segment results. In our Olefins & Polyolefins-Americas segment, third quarter EBITDA was $616 million, a $243 million decline compared to the second quarter. Relative to the previous quarter, Olefins results decreased by approximately $260 million, increasing feedstock prices caused margins to decline by nearly $0.05 per pound and sales volume decline due to production losses from Hurricane Harvey. Downtime on our Gulf Coast ethylene crackers during the storm resulted in an average ethylene operating rate of 76% for the quarter. 73% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 85% came from NGLs. In Polyolefins, combined results were relatively unchanged. Polyethylene sales were slightly higher than the second quarter, but lower than third quarter expectations due to Hurricane Harvey. Polyethylene spreads improved approximately $0.02 per pound, but were largely offset by reduced polypropylene volumes and declining margins due to polypropylene prices lagging monomer price increases. During October, polymer markets remained firm as customers continue to restock supply chains following the hurricane. Polymer supplies are expected to improve with higher production availability and new capacity, but ethylene inventory should continue to tighten due to planned industry maintenance and increased demand. Co-monomer availability to produce certain types of polyethylene continues to be a concern for the industry. With the restart of our La Porte cracker this morning, no major maintenance is planned in our olefins system for the remainder of 2017. Let's turn to slide 11 and review the performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $698 million, $1 million lower than the second quarter. This includes $108 million gain from the sale of our interest in Geosel. Olefins results declined by approximately $100 million on lower margins, primarily due to lower co-product prices. Utilization of advantaged feedstocks accounted for 53% of ethylene production and operating rates remained strong at 95%. Combined polyolefins results declined by approximately $10 million, with volume improvements partially offset by margin declines. During October, global markets remained balanced with good demand. Thriving naphtha prices are expected to pressure strong olefin margins. In October, we had an upset in our ethylene cracker, which required unplanned maintenance. I'm pleased to report that the repairs are complete and the cracker is operational again. The value of lost production due to the upset is forecasted to impact the fourth quarter by approximately $40 million. As in the U.S., no other major maintenance is planned in our European olefin system for the remainder of 2017. Now please turn to slide 12 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $402 million, an improvement of $63 million compared to the second quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives improved by approximately $25 million. Despite production losses due to Hurricane Harvey, sales volume increased due to the completion of planned maintenance in our PO/TBA plant in The Netherlands during the second quarter. Intermediate chemicals results improved by approximately $15 million as styrene margins improved. Volumes declined for most intermediate chemicals except for an increase in methanol volumes, due to the completion of second quarter planned maintenance at our Channelview facility. Oxyfuels and related products results improved by approximately $25 million, primarily due to volume increases upon the completion of the planned maintenance in our Netherlands facility. October volumes are improving for most Intermediates & Derivatives products with the absence of hurricane impacts on production and demand. Tighter supply due to production outages in the acetyl industry are improving margins. In contrast, high butane prices and typical fourth quarter seasonal declines are compressing oxyfuel margins. Now let's move to slide 13 for a discussion of the refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $58 million, a $33 million improvement over the prior quarter. We continuously and safely operated the refinery at reduced rates during Hurricane Harvey to minimize our losses and improved its speed of recovery after the storm. The Maya 2-1-1 improved primarily due to stronger distillate spreads. This improvement was partially offset by weak heavy to light crude differentials on our byproduct margins. Our technology segment continued to perform well with $47 million of EBITDA, approximately $1 million decline versus the second quarter. Turning to slide 14. Considering the effects of Hurricane Harvey, third quarter results showed the resilience of our business portfolio. We had earnings of $2.67 per share and strong results from our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. We continue to advance our 2,000 volume improvements with a 13% increase in ethylene production and 21% higher throughput at the refinery. Our growth initiatives continue with startup of a new plant in China and approval of our propylene oxide investment in Texas. By generating approximately $1.5 billion in cash from operations during the quarter, we continue to deploy capital toward a balanced mix of dividends, share repurchases and organic growth. As we look toward the remainder of 2017, we continue to see firm olefin and polyolefin markets, as supply chains restock from the production loss during Hurricane Harvey. New polyethylene capacity is aligned with seasonal demand and supportive of improved demand for ethylene monomer, while the industry awaits the startup of additional crackers during 2018. Global polymer demand remains strong. Most Intermediates & Derivatives products are well-positioned as we enter the fourth quarter and should help balance typical seasonal weakness in oxyfuels. U.S. Gulf Coast refining markets appear to have reset favorably after the hurricanes with strong distillate spreads and improved light to heavy differentials. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Bob, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about ethane. Obviously, the downtime didn't tighten up the ethane market, it looks like maybe in the next 12 or 18 months we'll see ethane consumption in the industry rise about 30%. So, give us some sense what you think would happen to your ethane costs if we revisit that maybe mid of 2018 and late 2018, how much higher it could be? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Sure. Good morning, Bob. I think part of the reason ethane prices were somewhat sticky that you can see temporary dislocations in terms of pipeline operations and so on. Our fundamental view is that we still see rejection of ethane in the range of 500,000 barrels per day and there is a lot more coming on from the Permian pipelines and fractionation capacity that's planned for next year. So my views haven't changed in terms of $0.07 to $0.10 sort of frac margins and abundance of ethane to meet the new demand that we expect from crackers in 2018. So, we're still pretty constructive and consistent with our views. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. You may go ahead. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Bob, we had tightness in polyethylene as you noted, you've had $0.07 in price increases. What's your sense of whether we can get additional price increases here? And as this new polyethylene capacity does start up in the fourth quarter, how quickly do you think this surge in pricing can last? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I still think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that markets are still relatively tight and not all of the industry has returned to unconstrained operations because of some of the comonomer lingering outages that does impact some grades of polyethylene. So my sense is that as the supply chain replenishes inventory, including our customers who likely depleted raw material and finished goods inventory, that'll probably carry us through the fourth quarter and in the first quarter as we showed in our presentation that generally we see a step up in demand seasonally in Q1 and then again in Q3. So I think this demand pattern will likely provide for pretty balanced markets. And so we'll have to see, but I think also we're starting from even a higher price base than when we had anticipated, and higher operating rate, so I think all of that points towards pretty constructive markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Oh, I'm sorry. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe you can just discuss, I guess, what you're seeing on both ethylene side and propylene side? You discussed that there is tightness in polyethylene but we have seen a little bit of give back on the ethylene side, and then similarly in polypropylene, you mentioned that it didn't keep up with the monomer, so maybe you can just talk a little bit about those changes as well. Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Sure, Arun. First of all in ethylene, you may have read that one of the crackers that was due to start up early next year has been pushed out due to the impacts from the storm. And also if you look ahead into the spring season, the turnaround season looks to be heavier than average, and certainly the planned maintenance looks like it's going to be more than the spring of 2016, so we see that further tightening ethylene going into next year. So we're pretty constructive on ethylene through first half of next year. And the timing of ethylene and polyethylene price increases that's really just sort of small sort of market movements over time. But I think ethylene is going to be pretty constructive through certainly the middle of next year until the last of large crackers starts up in this sort of series of start-ups that are coming. On propylene, what I had mentioned in my prepared remarks is really that generally propylene prices tend to lag by about a month. And so I think it's very normal the lag that we're seeing, but if we kind of step back, we still think polypropylene is very, very tight. There's not really any new capacity planned and demand is growing year-over-year. So, we're pretty constructive about polypropylene for some time frankly because there's not really any new greenfield capacity coming for another couple of years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just a question, I think it was like this call a year ago that sort of there was more talk about inorganic growth and M&A and obviously years now passed and nothing's happened. So, I know you can't be specific, but maybe at a high level, could you just sort of give us a postmortem on the last 12 months? And why hasn't anything happened, is it the bid-ask spreads are too high that you're not seeing the assets that you're interested in? And just any updated thoughts there would be helpful. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, good morning. So since our Investor Day, when we sort of presented our strategy and how we thought about inorganic growth, frankly, our strategic priorities did remain consistent, they haven't changed. We laid out our objectives, we laid out sort of the value chains in which we would find interest and we continue to be thoughtful and disciplined and our focus is on value creation. So my view is that not a whole lot has changed, and I don't think we expected in April that something was imminent and as the quarters have played out, that's been the case. So, we're going to be opportunistic, that's a very nature of inorganic growth and be focused on value creation and leverage our strengths. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. You may go ahead. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. You mentioned acetic acid prices were going up and I know you've got some announcements out there in the market. Can you talk about the cadence of acetic acid price increases and how that might impact profitability for Intermediates & Derivatives? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I think in the near-term, markets are a little bit tighter partly because of unplanned outages and we think that the market will be more balanced post all of this sort of settling out. And as you rightly mentioned, there is some more capacity coming, but likely that could moderate business conditions further in that value chain. I think the recent move up has been more because of the unplanned outages, whether it's there because of hurricanes or elsewhere due to mechanical issues. Operator : Thank you. David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Bob, when these crackers do come on-stream middle of next year and maybe even the back half of next year, how do you think margins will at least in the short term, how much compression could they see on either ethylene or a combined ethylene, polyethylene basis in the U.S.? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Good morning, David. Let me give you a few statistics to help frame the degree of sort of supply growth exceeding demand growth. This is IHS data for your consideration, so 2016 to 2017, by IHS data, we'd estimate that supply for polyethylene has grown by about 7% from 2016 to 2017, and demand has grown at 4%, which is the number we've been talking about for some time and consistent with history. So you could say perhaps that supply growth from 2016 to 2017 exceeds demand growth by 3%. 2017 to 2018, based on published numbers, supply growth increases by 4.7% and let's assume that demand grows by another 4%. If you look across those two years, you end up with perhaps operating rates declining by 3%, 4% coming off of very, very high operating rates and what we would consider still to be balanced markets on an annual average basis and tight markets during seasonal periods. If you look at that slide that we showed in our presentation, it shows that the growth really comes in the first three quarters in a year. And when you think about operating rates, effective operating rates still being in the 90%s post this period of supply exceeding demand growth, I think markets are going to be pretty balanced and as we go into the seasonal upturn in 2018, I think there is the potential for this capacity to be absorbed over that period of time. So and the other thing I would offer is that because of the recent price movements, our starting point is higher than it would have been otherwise. So, I don't have a crystal ball to tell you how much prices could decline next year, but it seems to me that with the starting point being higher prices and starting point being very high operating rates and modest decline, we're going to have pretty constructive markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. You may go ahead. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: With Brent crude trading in the high $50s or close to $60 today, what is the impact of higher oil prices on your European cracker, what are utilization rates there and what do you expect on co-product values? Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So as you know, in our European fleet, on an annual average basis, a little more than half of our feedstock is non-naphtha based or purchased at a discount to naphtha and I think that will continue. I think the availability of those what we call advantaged feeds should continue. Higher oil prices should provide for higher co-product prices over time and there is some seasonality in there. So, I think ticking from low-$50s to upper-$50s on Brent in my mind doesn't materially change the competitiveness of our European assets. And if you consider further, the backdrop of still a relatively weak euro compared to dollar, compared to what it was a couple of years ago, we've seen imports actually decline into Europe this year on polyethylene. So I think Europe is still going to be competitive and my expectation is that we're going to run at maximum rates next year of available capacity. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Just a data point P.J., we were running at 95% during the third quarter in Europe on our crackers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. You may go ahead. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more color on the $200 million impact from Harvey in terms of what the split might be between lost sales and direct costs, as well as color on the impact by major product line or segment, please? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. Most of that was from lost sales in terms of the $200 million impact. We had some fixed costs related to maintenance and so on. But you can consider most of it to be volume related. In terms of the split on the segments, about 60% in the Americas, 20% IND, 20% refining, approximately that sort of split is what \u2013 where the impact landed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. You may go ahead. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. You talked about the hurricanes delaying new projects, La Porte was more impacted than your other facilities. Why wasn't the Hyperzone project delayed? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, first of all let me frame for you kind of our asset base along the Gulf Coast and just to sort of help understand, I think how well we did during the storm. As I mentioned during my prepared remarks, we've about nine assets, nine individual sites from Corpus Christi to Lake Charles, Louisiana. And in that there are four polyethylene sites and four large crackers. So, we think about our participation or our number of assets we have relative to others in the industry, we have a considerable amount of assets here, add to that headquarters with about a 1,100 people in Houston and a pipeline system that's more than 2,000 miles. So, if you kind of put all of that in your mind and you think about $200 million impact on mostly lost volume, I think that's really outstanding and really credit to our people. We weren't impacted on the project at La Porte because we're still very early in the construction. We've just now started to pour foundations and we're coming out of the ground as the same goes in the construction business; so very early. We still project startup mid 2019 for our polyethylene unit. And given the earliness in our construction, the timeline really hasn't been impacted. So that's how to think about the project versus the cracker at La Porte. Operator : Thank you. Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes, good morning. And Bob, just following up on Hyperzone, the next major project that you've going on is PO/TBA, but there has been press reports or speculation that you may be doing a propylene unit as well. Could you talk about what your plans are on these very large organic growth opportunities? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. So first of all, Frank, we have multiple platforms in the company, which we can build on and that's essentially as we talked about during Investor Day, our aim was to deploy some of our free cash flow into organic growth, so that we could think about earnings growth through cycles and have a positive slope through these cycles and I think we're starting to build a pipeline now. Having done our ethylene expansions early and having paid for most of them by now, I think we now can focus on derivatives and we can focus on propylene chain, whether it's PO/TBA or polypropylene. So I think this is sort of a continuation of what we laid out during Investor Day and our organic growth opportunities and pipeline, we have ahead of us. So to me, this is the next natural sort of organic growth opportunity after announcing polyethylene and PO/TBA is to go to polypropylene where we see a market that's growing at reasonable rates. We have a global position in polypropylene. We have a strong technology position with leading process technology and polyolefin catalyst. So, it's a chance to leverage technology in a region that we think is growing at a rate where there's an opportunity for more capacity to meet that growing demand. And really what we're thinking through beyond polypropylene is where that propylene will come from and we're thinking about whether we build our own PDH unit or we further purchase more propylene from the market. And to me that's really kind of a make versus buy decision and very return-oriented focus. So \u2013 but it's something that I'd like to see us move with pace and as the report suggest, currently we're on the trajectory of making a final investment decision by the end of next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura. You may go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Bob, just as a follow-up on a previous question. You outlined a fairly positive view of ethylene supply and demand in the short term and the long term. And also, you have a favorable view on ethane availability. So in that context, why is a large scale ethylene investment not on the table right now? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think, Alex, we have the opportunity to do so many other things at the moment that have equal or better returns. And so, our focus is to build out the polyethylene capacity after Hyperzone, we'll think about whether we want to do another polyethylene plant. We've talked about that. We're already doing now the PO/TBA project. So again, to me, we have multiple platforms we can build on and at some point we will cross the decision of additional ethylene and polyethylene capacity. But in the meantime, we can diversify our project \u2013 our organic growth through the multiple platforms and that's really what I would prefer at the moment. Operator : Your next question is from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. You may go ahead. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Bob, as I take a look at some of the pricing movements that happened post the hurricanes, obviously, ethylene pricing shot up as did polyethylene. But it seems polyethylene shot up at a more rapid rate than ethylene, right? And one of the arguments that I've been hearing is that there was a comonomer facility outage and there is sort of a fair bit of tightness within the comonomer market, maybe potentially explaining why polyethylene prices ran faster than ethylene. So would just love to hear your views on the comonomer side of things and the role that that may have played on the polyethylene, call it tightness or pricing movement? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think certainly, Hassan, those two are related, especially in early part of October and the latter part of September, we certainly were looking for other sources of supply for comonomer, and while we were doing that we couldn't run our polyethylene plants at full rate, so post-hurricane to the extent that we could run \u2013 we could only run about 80% in September and we've been able to ramp up a little bit more. But that comonomer facility has a significant percentage of supply, about half of the comonomer in the U.S. comes from that facility and on a global basis something like 20% I believe. So, very important and that has constrained polyethylene production and therefore, the need for ethylene. I suspect that as we move through November, some of that will ease and the comonomer supply will resume. But we don't really know much more than that at this point. And then if you think about beyond that, by January, we already be moving into then the seasonal uptick as we do every year in Q1. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead. Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. The polyethylene supply that's coming on in the U.S., how much has the right technical specification either to be shipped to Europe or absorbed by domestic demand in the U.S.? And are there any steps that Lyondell can take in order to preserve the premium pricing in those two regions? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think, Ian, first of all, I think it's important to look under the headline of polyethylene and consider how much of the new capacity is linear low density, low density and high density polyethylene. And it's the first thing to think about when we think about destination markets and impact on domestic premiums, if you will. And the conclusion I think is that there is a reasonable amount of balance between these three polyethylenes and on a percentage basis, by IHS data, it seems that the percentage increase in supply is the greatest in linear low density polyethylene and it's meaningfully so between the conventional and the metallocene linear lows. So, I can't speak for how others have planned for all of that, but I can tell you for us as a company, we've been thinking through all of that. We've been thinking through moving incremental product through our own marketing network both in Europe and in Asia and supply chains required to reach those markets, and we're very well-prepared and our plans are on a good timeline. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. You may go ahead. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, fellows. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Question. As you guys with your technology business have a pretty unique view on a lot of what's happening in the olefins in the future globally. Two questions of that, your best guess the range of how many new olefin crackers will be announced over the next year globally? And then the second one on that with the Chinese move on environmental stuff, do you think that does anything to their existing or their future plans around CTO and MTO? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Thanks, Duffy for your question. You can understand the confidential nature of our discussions in the technologies segment. So I'll be general in my comments. First of all, I think the move in China, specifically, are tighter environmental regulation and the move away from recycled polyethylene, both of those point towards more constructive markets globally, and meaning directionally less supply because of regulations and more demand for virgin polyethylene as opposed to recycled polyethylene in China. I think both of those, especially the reduction in recycled content directionally increases operating rates for 2018. In terms of what we're seeing in our business longer term, I think we do see some delays in also olefin-type projects, especially in the coastal areas and generally some delays in polypropylene decisions as well. So, we don't see a significant sort of wave of expansions on a global basis beyond what's reported by IHS. So, I'll leave it there to be respectful of the confidential nature of that business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. You may go ahead. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: The numbers you listed earlier, you said demand growth of 4%, supply of 7%. I've seen the same numbers, but they just don't add up, right, because margins didn't change. So what do you think is wrong with these numbers or where \u2013 in what direction are they wrong or why don't they match up? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, it could be, Jonas, again I'm quoting IHS data and it could be that the expansions are sort of back end loaded in the year that could potentially explain part of that. But the other is and I continue to believe their operating rates are so high that 2%, 3% reduction in operating rates doesn't put us in a significantly different market environment. You add to that seasonality and now the hurricane impact, which likely moderates Q4 2017, I think all of that says, as we've suggested in our prepared remarks that markets are well-positioned to absorb a good bit of this new capacity that's coming. So, perhaps those things help explain what your question is. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may go ahead, sir. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Matthew. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: I was just hoping you could talk about the refining side, the IMO 2020 sulfur spec. It seems that could be a pretty big positive to your plant, which I believe produces a relatively low percentage of fuel oil considering all the heavy crude it runs. So, are you seeing the same things and also would you plan any sort of investments around the refinery to better take advantage of this upcoming sulfur spec? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Well, Matthew, this IMO topic has gained more momentum as the year has gone on. And this is essentially the change in the bunker fuel spec for a shift that fuel would lower sulfur as a cap, if you will. Our refinery is really well positioned to take advantage of upside that this potentially might represent. The upside for the rest of our listeners, it really comes from two sources, one is from potentially wider light to heavy differentials on crude pricing. The theory being that heavier crudes will be more in supply as fewer refineries can meet the sulfur specifications. The other is, we think, as you mentioned, Matthew, stronger distillate margins, which again are very heavy, complex refinery \u2013 heavy crude processing complex refinery is well-positioned to capture indeed (47:34) stronger distillate margins come about. So as time goes on, we're going to monitor this and see how it plays out. But as it stands today, a new regulation will go into effect in January of 2020, which is not so far away now. And I think we'll have very good visibility next year. So I like how our refinery is positioned. As to your question about what are we doing in the meantime? Our focus really is about having a highly reliable refinery, we've already made improvements from 2016 to 2017 as evidenced in our numbers, and we want to be positioned as well as possible to operate at very high rates, whether IMO has an impact or not. And so, we're quite focused on an improvement plan, which we're implementing and I'm quite pleased with the results in 2017 and very aware that we need to continue to deliver results year-after-year at our refinery, much like we do with all the other assets in the company. So, we'll have to see how this goes, but we're encouraged by what IMO may represent for our refinery. Operator : Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bob Patel for any closing comments. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : All right. Thank you, Michele. Well, with no further questions in the queue, let me close with a few remarks. We've operated well through Q3 this year and I'm especially proud of our team and how well they've responded to this extraordinary natural disaster that was Harvey. Nearly 40% of our employees in a significant part of our global asset base were in the path of the storm. Our team remains consistently focused on safe, reliable, cost efficient operations. I continue to believe these strengths and focus provide the foundation for future growth, towards which we have made significant strides in through Q3 2017. In early February 2018, we look forward to discussing our full-year results from 2017 and we will have an expanded earnings call at that time, during which we'll provide updates on LyondellBasell growth strategy. Until then, thank you for your thoughtful questions and continued interest in our company. With that, our call is adjourned. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's fourth quarter 2017 teleconference. I am joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO and Thomas Aebischer, our CFO. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I would also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 :00 P.M. Eastern Time today until March 5, by calling 866-677-5199 in the United States and 203-369-3133 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 6549. During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance, the current environment, our near-term outlook and then we will take a little time to provide you with an update on LyondellBasell's strategic progress. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market adjustments or LCM which we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and declines in prices of raw materials and finished goods inventories. While no LCM adjustments were recorded during 2017, LCM did affect results for prior years. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call all over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thanks Dave. Good morning to all and thank you for taking the time to join our fourth quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide four and review the results we delivered during the 2017 and our progress in advancing our growth strategy. During last year's fourth quarter teleconference, we described how our work in 2016 to complete both an unusually heavy maintenance schedule and 20% expansion program for our U.S. ethylene capacity would lead to higher volume in 2017. Our team overcame challenges from capacity additions in our industry and obstacles from Hurricane Harvey to deliver significant volume improvements and an 8% increase in EBITDA. Our profitability resulted in an 8.4% free cash flow yield and capital returns that exceeded the company's cost of capital by more than three times. LyondellBasell's shareholder returns in 2017 continue to surpass the strong growth of the S&P 500 and the S&P chemical index benchmarks. During our Investor Day in April of 2017, we outlined our ambitions to build on our strengths and skills by adding value through organic growth and a disciplined pursuit of inorganic opportunities. Last year, we advanced organic growth by moving forward on two major greenfield capacity additions by expanding our global reach with a third compounding plant in China and by partnering with SUEZ on a venture for plastic recycling in Europe. We improved our capabilities in readiness for growth with targeted investments in people to support increased activity for both organic project development and inorganic growth. We also applied our strengths in operational excellence to drive improved reliability at our refinery while extending our legacy technical innovation within our polymer businesses. Our strong 2017 results have a foundation in our core values which include a fundamental commitment to top-tier safety performance. Turning to slide five. Our safety performance during 2017 continued to be among the best in our industry. Our employees had fewer injuries than any prior year in the company's history. In addition to a lower number of injuries, we saw significant reductions in the severity of environmental and safety incidents across our company. While I am pleased to see the improvements, we remain focused in our drive to capture the lessons learned from our experiences and work towards safety perfection. In addition to the obvious benefits for our employees, contractors and communities, we continue to believe that a consistent focus on safety cascade benefits throughout the company's operations, reliability and ultimately our financial results. Slide six summarizes the improvements in our quarterly and annual results relative to 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 income and earnings per share increased primarily due to an $819 million one-time, non-cash benefit from U.S. tax reform that increased earnings by $2.07 per share. The quarterly EBITDA profile in the bottom of the slide reflects typical seasonal trends for our industry, with stronger results in the second and third quarters. Fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA benefited from volume and margin strength following third quarter inventory declines in the U.S. driven by Hurricane Harvey. During our third quarter call, I mentioned that we would incur October impacts, primarily in our La Porte cracker from the effects of Hurricane Harvey and also that one of our German crackers incurred downtime during October. These events impacted fourth quarter results by approximately $100 million and $40 million respectively. EBITDA increased by 23% for the fourth quarter relative to the same quarter last year and 8% for the year relative to 2016. Year-over-year EBITDA improvements were driven by improved margins and increased volumes following our investments in maintenance and growth during 2016. Slide seven shows how our team delivered on volume improvements during 2017 with 23 of our plans around the world setting annual production records. With a lighter maintenance schedule than 2016 and the completion of our U.S. ethylene expansion program, our global fleet of crackers produced 13% more ethylene in 2017. The improved monomer availability allowed us to run our equity derivatives at higher rates and increase polyethylene and ethylene upside volumes by 4%. Volumes could have been even higher if not for the disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey. Our focused maintenance and reliability efforts at the refinery increased 2017 throughput by 35,000 barrels per day, a 17% year-over-year improvement. I sincerely thank all of our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in delivering these impressive results. And now Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you Bob and good morning to all of you. Please turn to slide eight which shows our fourth quarter and full year segment results. I am pleased to report that our Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment achieved the fourth consecutive year of record EBITDA. In 2017, we show an EBITDA improvement in four of our five segments. These results will be reviewed in detail during the segment discussion. As mentioned by Bob, fourth quarter results include an $819 million one-time, non-cash tax benefit related to the passage of U.S. tax reform in December. This benefited fourth quarter results by $2.07 per share and full year results by $2.05 per share. Full year 2017 results also include a $106 million after-tax charge due to bond refinancing and the $103 million after-tax gain from the sale of our interest in the Geosel pipeline and storage system in France. Please turn to slide nine which provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2017, we continued strong cash generation with $5.2 billion of cash from operating activities. Our capital spending was lower than anticipated for the year due to later timing for the final investment decision for our PO/TBA plant and the classification of certain project related spending as intangible. During the first quarter of 2017, we took advantage of favorable markets and refinanced $1 billion of 5% notes due in 2019 with an equivalent amount of 3.5% bonds due in 2027. With this transaction, we also derisked refinancing risks in 2019. In the third quarter, Standard & Poor's raised LyondellBasell's senior unsecured debt to BBB+ from BBB. Our strong cash flow allows us to finish 2017 with a cash and liquid investment balance of approximately $3.4 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than the year. Turning to slide 10, let's look at the evolution of our cash deployment over time. Our strong cash generation has allowed us fund both value creating growth project and returns to shareholders. Over the past five years, we have funded $8.3 billion of capital investments. Approximately 45% of this investment was allocated to profit generating growth projects. We have returned $22.9 billion through dividends and share repurchases over the past five years. We implemented our ninth dividend increase to $0.90 per share in the second quarter. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 189 million shares or approximately 33% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of 2017, we had repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares or 16% of the current 18 months share repurchase authorization that started in May 2017. On slide 11, I would like to describe our current understanding of how U.S. tax reform will benefit LyondellBasell. We have already mentioned the $819 million non-cash benefit for 2017. This benefit arises from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities after new lower corporate tax rate. While this is a provisional estimate based on our current best understanding of the legislation, we do not anticipate any material adjustments over the coming year. In the middle chart, you will note that a substantial portion of our global income is earned in the U.S. As a result, in 2018 we expect our global effective tax rate will be approximately 21%. We do not expect any material impact from deemed repatriation, interest deductibility limit or the base erosion provision. As we do every year, I would like to address some of your 2018 modeling questions. Regarding capital, we are currently planning to spend approximately $2.4 billion during 2018. This spending level advances both our base maintenance and growth program. Approximately 55% is targeted toward profit generating growth. The majority of this growth investment in 2018 will be dedicated to the new Hyperzone polyethylene plant and the PO/TBA plant. Although not all plants are finalized, we estimate capital spending to average $3 billion annually through 2022. Approximately 65% is targeted towards profit generating growth. The largest individual growth project in this period is, as we have talked about, PO/TBA plant for which we obtained final investment decision in the first-half of 2017. Our net cash interest expense for 2018 is expected to be approximately $375 million. 2018 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.2 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2018 that total approximately $110 million and we estimate the pension expense of approximately $65 million. As I a mentioned before, we currently expect the 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 21%., the cash tax rate is expected to be higher for 2018 due to payments covering higher non-U.S. income in prior years. With this, I will now turn the call back to Bob for a discussion of our segment results in more detail. Thank you very much. Bob Patel : Thank you Thomas. Let's turn to slide 12. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, fourth quarter and full year results were supported by Hurricane Harvey supply constraints and strong global markets. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $784 million, $168 million more than third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $3 billion. Relative to the third quarter, ethylene margins increased by $0.05 per pound. Despite some lingering disruption from Hurricane Harvey at our La Porte facility, our ethylene cracker operating rates remained strong during the quarter averaging 92%. 79% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 87% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results improved by approximately $40 million. During the quarter, our polyethylene price spread over ethylene improved by approximately 40.02 per pound. For the full year, results increased by $105 million primarily due to ethylene production volumes improving by 17% as we captured the benefits of our expanded capacity at Corpus Christi and the absence of planned maintenance. Polyolefins results declined by approximately $70 million from the prior year as polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.05 per pound, partially offset by an increase in polyethylene spreads by approximately $0.02 per pound. During January, IHS is forecasting a decrease in polyethylene margin with some improvement by the end of the first quarter. The U.S. Gulf Coast experienced unusually cold weather during the third week of January that caused disruptions across the industry. Our assets were also affected and we currently estimate that these disruptions will reduce LyondellBasell's first quarter results by approximately $45 million, with approximately two-thirds in O&P Americas and most of the remainder in intermediates and derivatives. In addition, we have planned maintenance on one of our two crackers at Channelview during the first and second quarter that is estimated to have a $100 million impact on results with approximately 50% of that occurring during the first quarter. Turning to slide 13. Let's look at the forecast for the global ethylene industry. 2017 results support our view of a relatively modest reduction in operating rates over 2018 and 2019. Industry project delays coupled with supply constraints from Hurricane Harvey and Chinese reforms have improved the outlook for the next couple of years. Demand growth over the past six years has outpaced capacity growth resulting in extremely high operating rates, near 95% over the past two years. As new capacity comes online, operating rates will decline, however they are forecasted to remain in the mid low 90s. Let's turn to slide 14 and review performance outside the Americas in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $356 million or $342 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was our fourth consecutive record, $2.3 billion, a $215 million increase versus 2016. Olefins results decreased versus the third quarter by approximately $100 million primarily due to lower margins resulting from increasing costs of raw materials. As I mentioned in our third quarter call, we had an unplanned outage at one of our crackers investment in Germany in October. The value of lost production due to the upset impacted the fourth quarter by $40 million. Combined polyolefin results declined by $75 million as we experienced seasonal sales volume declines for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Olefins results for the full year increased by approximately $190 million over 2016. Margins improved with increased ethylene price. With no planned maintenance in 2017, volumes increased following the completion of planned maintenance at two crackers in Europe in 2016. Our polyolefins results decreased approximately $50 million year-on-year, primarily due to decreased polyethylene spread over ethylene. During January, markets were relatively consistent with demand improving after the holidays. Within the industry, five European crackers are scheduled to be in turnaround during the first half of 2018. Consultants are forecasting approximately 9% of regional capacity will be unavailable during the second quarter. We will have planned maintenance on one of our European crackers in the second half of the year. Now please turn to slide 15 for a look at the improvement in our intermediates and derivatives segment. Quarterly EBITDA has been steadily increasing with fourth quarter EBITDA At $410 million or an $8 million improvement over the third quarter. For the full-year, the segment generated EBITDA of $1.5 billion, a $157 million increase over 2016. 2017 marked a return to the historic levels we have typically seen for this business. The fourth quarter reflected a net result of seasonal declines in oxyfuel margins and volume improvements in PO and derivatives and oxyfuels as production returned to normal levels post Hurricane Harvey. During 2017, the $157 million increase in EBITDA was largely due to margin improvement in PO and derivatives and intermediate chemicals relative to 2016. Oxyfuels and related products declined by approximately $60 million as volumes were restricted due to planned maintenance in the first half of 2017 and margins declined due to increased butane pricing. We expect to see continued strength in the market pulling into the first quarter of 2018. The strength in styrene and methanol margins will help offset these low volume declines. Let's move to slide 16 for a discussion of our refining results. We have seen a positive trajectory in our operational improvement and margin capture in 2017. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $104 million, an improvement of $46 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $157 million of EBITDA, an improvement of $85 million versus 2016. During the fourth quarter, the majority of the increased profitability was provided by a benefit from last in, first out or LIFO inventory. Relative to the third quarter, crude throughput improved by 5,000 barrels per day to 245,000 barrels per day. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark declined by $1.55 per barrel. However, we are able to capture margin improvement due to favorable heavy to light differentials in the crude oil markets. The cost of RINs increased by approximately $20 million. During 2017, crude throughput averaged 236,000 barrels per day, up 35,000 barrels per day from 2016. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark increased by $1.32 per barrel and averaged $20.56 per barrel. The consistent improvement quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in refining demonstrates our commitment to improve this asset's reliability and performance going forward. We look forward to stronger contributions from our refinery in 2018. Slide 17 might be familiar to some of you from our April Investor Day presentation. In the time since our listing as a public company in 2010, we have established the culture, skills and systems required to build the next phase of value generation at LyondellBasell. We continue to focus on the foundational elements of operational excellence, cost discipline and prudent financial stewardship that created significant shareholder value over the past seven years. We aim to extend our reach and apply these capability and strengths across a larger set of assets. Let's turn to slide 18 and review the plans for our organic growth pipeline. Over the past year, we have described the progress of our new Hyperzone high-density polyethylene plant and our next PO/TBA plant. We also talked about two additional ethylene debottlenecks at Channelview, the first of which will start up in 2020. Over the past year, we have also made selective investments in people to support additional project management and engineering teams to increase the cadence of these growth investments. Our pipeline of attractive projects is strong. It targets multiple value chains and our goal is to bring on new capacity that will grow EBITDA nearly every year. Our teams are moving forward with preliminary engineering, planning and analysis for these potential projects to reach final investment decisions. The initial projects to emerge from our pipeline include polypropylene plants in North America and Europe, build-or-buy scenarios for propylene monomer to support these expansions and an additional PE plant after our second Channelview ethylene debottleneck. On slide 19, we have an update on the first project, our Hyperzone HDPE plant, which is under construction at our La Porte site which is near the Houston Ship Channel. As you can see in the photo, major components of the multi-zone reactor are already onsite and construction is proceeding on schedule. The charts on the left provide more insight regarding our selection of high-density polyethylene for this project over other types of PE. With global demand growing at an annual rate of about 4%, the world needs approximately 12 new world scale, high-density plants over the three years from 2018 to 2020. Linear low and low density PE serve smaller markets with demand growth to support only 10 and four plants, respectively over the same time period. In addition, IHS is forecasting HDPE capacity additions equivalent to only seven new plants over the next three years, while linear low and low density appear to have some excess capacity in the short term. We believe that our new Hyperzone HDPE capacity is well timed to capture growing market demand with a projected startup date in mid-2019. Slide 20 provides some perspective on the drivers for expanding our global polypropylene business. In 2017, global demand for polypropylene was approximately 150 billion pounds and growing at an annual rate of approximately 5%. Unlike the ethylene chain, no region has a clear feedstock advantage across propylene derivatives. After many years of industry capacity rationalizations and very little expansion, we are confident that new capacity is needed in both North America and Europe. With approximately 17 billion pounds of global polypropylene capacity across our JVs and wholly owned plants, our leading position in PP technology and catalysts and almost three billion pounds of downstream polypropylene compounding capacity, we believe our company is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity across the value chain. In addition to building new assets, we continue to drive improvement on our existing asset base. Turning to slide 21, I would like to highlight the great work by our team at the Houston refinery in improving the reliability and profitability of this asset over the past year. 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 were difficult times for our refinery due to high levels of both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime. I am pleased to say by rededicating ourselves and applying our deep institutional knowledge of operational excellence, the team achieved great improvements in our refinery performance in 2017. The refinery achieved near nameplate crude throughput to capacity during the second quarter of 2017 and maintained strong operations for the remainder of the year despite challenges of Hurricane Harvey. Widening light-heavy crude differentials, coupled with strong diesel demand, has improved the market outlook for 2018. In early 2017, our refinery completed the investments needed to meet the new Tier 3 gasoline sulfur specifications. As one of the largest heavy sour coking refineries in the U.S., LyondellBasell's refinery is well positioned to benefit from the new International Maritime Organization regulations that reduce the amount of sulfur in marine fuel oil. Refining consultants believe that these regulations could add several dollars to the Maya 2-1-1 refining benchmark, which could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars in additional profitability at our refinery. While we await implementation of the IMO regulations at the start of 2020, our refinery continues their trajectory to improve reliability and capture increased profitability. LyondellBasell's portfolio of refining and commodity chemical businesses have demonstrated resiliency across a dynamic environment, changing feedstocks, feedstock cost and economic conditions. Slide 22 provides a perspective on the elements behind our results. LyondellBasell's two global O&P segments generated somewhat complementary results over the past five years. When Europe, Asia and International experienced higher naphtha feedstock cost during the periods of elevated crude oil from 2013 to 2014, the Americas segment continued to benefit from low-cost, shale-based NGL feedstocks and realized higher margins due to the upward global pressure on polymer pricing. Conversely, the naphtha-based EAI segment improved margins under relatively low crude oil prices since late 2014 while American margins compressed. The complementary results provide a relatively stable earnings profile in the upper left chart, generating an average EBITDA of about $5.2 billion across our global O&P segments. The more diverse portfolio of businesses within I&D, refining and technology, depicted in the upper right chart, also produced a stable earnings profile with an average EBITDA of approximately $2 billion. Our strategy aims to build upon the consistent overall results depicted on the bottom chart by continued growth and optimization of this business portfolio. LyondellBasell continues to generate substantial cash flow and on slide 23, an illustrative chart describes our strategy for allocating these resources towards value-driven growth. The foundational priority of our strategy is ensuring that our existing assets continue to operate safely, reliably and profitably through investment in maintenance capital. Next, we gradually increased our dividend yield since 2011 to achieve a top quartile level among our peers. We have committed to a progressive dividend that is sustainable through business cycles. As we built our project execution capabilities over the past five years, we have increased our investment in profit generating growth projects. As I discussed, we are increasing the cadence of this investment toward a more consistent growth profile targeting multiple value chains. Since 2013, we have allocated the remainder of our cash flow and some incremental borrowing toward our $16 billion of share repurchases. The incremental borrowing was part of our debt recapitalization and optimization that ultimately reduced our cost of debt. We do not intend to borrow further to support repurchases, but continue to believe that our shares are undervalued relative to our peers. As such, repurchases will continue to play a role in our capital deployment strategy. Finally, we maintain a strong balance sheet to preserve our capability to pursue any compelling and accretive inorganic growth opportunity that may arise at various points within business cycles. At the same time, we remain committed to maintaining the flexibility afforded by our investment grade credit rating. As shown on slide 24, our thinking around inorganic growth continues to be focused on targets where the application of our strengths and skills can add value. As we outlined during Investor Day in April of last year, these opportunities typically overlap, extend or stood adjacent to our existing footprint in petrochemical process industries. Let's turn to slide 25 and briefly consider the opportunities afforded by our rich history of innovation. LyondellBasell is the global leader in polypropylene compounding with almost three billion pounds of capacity at our JV and wholly owned plants in 18 locations around the world. This business develops innovative materials for interior, exterior and underhood applications that enable manufacturers to reduce vehicle weight by substituting polyolefin compounds for heavier and higher cost metals and engineering resins. Our group works closely with both manufacturers of internal combustion engine vehicles and new electric platforms to pursue improved performance, fuel efficiency for EV range. LyondellBasell's compounds have a leading position with many vehicle platforms, including the Tesla Model 3. Compounding is a natural extension of our polypropylene value chain from technology to catalyst to polymer to colored compound. Another example of our innovation capability is our new HDPE plant which will be the first facility to deploy our new Hyperzone technology. This represents a new application of a technology originally developed for polypropylene that differentiates and improves the properties and capabilities of polyethylene. Our Hyperzone technology improves the value proposition for our customers by offering the potential for improvements in processing efficiency and weight reduction while maintaining strength and durability. I would also like to highlight our recent announcement to partner with SUEZ to manufacture premium recycled polyolefins. While small in scale, the venture answers an increasing call from many brand owners to source a portion of their polymer demand from recycled materials. We look forward to clearing regulatory approvals and closing the acquisition in the coming weeks. In summary, let me distill our strategy to a few guiding principles depicted on slide 26. We understand what drives our core advantages and we will continue the benchmarking and continuous improvement that extends these leading positions. Our company has a resilient portfolio of businesses that can leverage geographic, feedstock and market diversity to achieve superior results. Our increasing focus on growth will be guided by advantaged positions and where LyondellBasell's strengths create tangible value. The financial strategy is underpinned by assigning strong value and commitment to our investment grade credit rating. The aim of all of this is aligned with you, our owners, towards the delivery of consistent, top quartile shareholder returns. Finally on slide 27, let me summarize our 2017 results and outlook. The hard work of LyondellBasell's employees drove volume improvement that captured opportunity in a strong global market. U.S. tax reform increased 2017 [ph] earnings and will continue to provide benefits for the company in the coming years. In 2018, we look forward to continuing the trajectory of improving reliability and profitability at our refinery while pursuing our strategy of value driven growth. Before we open the line for your questions, please turn to slide 30. In March, we will again be holding a reception here in Houston for those of you who will be in town attending conferences that week. We will begin late in the afternoon on Wednesday, March 21 at our usual location, near our offices and the IHS conference venue. The reception will allow you time to interact with members of our executive leadership team. Please watch your e-mail for invitations or contact Dave Kinney for further details. With that, we are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets, you may go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Bob Patel : Good morning Arun. Arun Viswanathan : First, on your ethylene and polyethylene outlook. On slide 13, you show an excess of seven billion pounds over the next couple of years for a 2% drop in operating rates. And you also mentioned that IHS has margin declines forecasted for January. But other consultants have actually settled January flat. The industry has a $0.04 per pound increase for February. So how do you expect these declines to play out? Is it more second half of 2018 phenomenon? And is there a possibility that delays in demand upside would result in limited price to margin compression over the next couple of years? Bob Patel : Yes. So Arun, as we finished last year, the market still were quite balanced or tight as there was some recovery from the Harvey effort. Incrementally, the weather here in Houston in January did impact production, including ours, as I mentioned. So our sense is that the backdrop is perhaps even a little bit tighter than what folks had depicted when some of those publications came out. And if you will recall, in our third quarter earnings release, I had described that typically in a given year, given seasonality in our business, most of the growth in a year happens in the first week orders of the year. So I suspect that we are going to have pretty firm market conditions through most of this year. And we will look for perhaps some weakness in Q4 when demand seasonally declines. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, maybe you can just discuss your strategic priorities a little bit. There was limited buyback activity, it appears, in Q4 and Thomas mentioned M&A. So what are you thinking there? What are you seeing there? Is there any kind of time frame as to what you would want to get something done? Or how is that playing out? Thanks. Bob Patel : Yes. So first, I would say, Arun, I wouldn't tie the two together. As I mentioned during my prepared remarks, when we think of our cash deployment priorities and our hierarchy, share repurchases continue to be firmly a part of that plan. So maybe I will turn over to Thomas to describe some of the tactics around how we engage in our share repurchase program to better explain how we go about things. So Thomas? Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, Bob. So we finished the year, obviously, very strong. We had a strong quarter. We had real strong cash generation in the fourth quarter. And as I have mentioned, the balance is $3.4 billion of cash, which actually is also very well balanced when you look at it from a business perspective. We have about 44% of our cash in Euro and 49% in U.S. dollars and very equivalent of how we are actually running the business. So we are very deliberate how we manage that position. In terms of your question on share buybacks, as Bob has mentioned it, that we have an existing program. In May 2017, we approved another 10% of share buybacks. Out of that program in 2017, we have bought back about 16% of that particular program. The intention clearly is in our next AGM to get an approval of an additional 10%. So having said all this, you also saw that in the fourth quarter, we have not had any shares purchased. But that's mainly related to the strategy. We have 10b5-1. You know how the process works. We are opportunistic and buy back opportunistically our shares. We commit on that 10b5-1 to a grid. The share price traded throughout the fourth quarter outside of that grid. That's virtually, in a nutshell, the explanation. But we are committed that this is one of the cash allocation strategic positions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Steve Byrne from Bank of America, you may go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. Just wanted to drill into your views on these Chinese reforms. How much polyolefin capacity in China do you believe has been curtailed in recent months due to some of the government initiatives there? Bob Patel : Yes. Good morning Steve. I don't have a firm number on that. But I think there's been some impact in addition to the reduction in some of the recycling. So if you step back and look at polyethylene supply/demand growth and kind of look globally, from 2017 to 2018, we are expecting that PE capacity is probably going to grow about 5.6% on a nameplate basis and HDPE is going to grow 4.1%, which is about equivalent to its growth rate annually. So whether it's Chinese reforms, weather related issues here, I think all of it kind of nets out to very balanced market conditions for the foreseeable quarters and that we don't see this supply excess as being significant. And we are starting at very high operating rates. So I think all these things you mentioned, they all have incremental impact on that supply/demand balance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Sorry. I was on mute. Thank you. Bob, I haven't heard you talk about feedstock prices, ethane, in particular and sort of what the outlook is for that as we move through 2017, maybe particularly given now that we have a nice high oil price and maybe some more associated gas production. So not to lead the witness, but what's your outlook for ethane for the year? Or maybe for next year? Bob Patel : Good morning Vincent. So ethane kind of followed gas prices here recently. When you step back and look at the numbers, the last number that we have they had been published in November and it had the production of ethane was kind of the order of 1.6 million barrels per day, consumption was about 1.3 million barrels per day. So we still have more ethane production than demand. And this is in a backdrop where propane and butane weren't really in the mix because they were quite expensive. So as we move through this year and as propane and butane prices moderate, I think that, combined with more ethane coming to market with new fracs and new pipelines from the Permian, we continue to believe that there's enough ethane nearby the Gulf Coast to supply the new crackers that will come online. And if anything, as you mentioned, higher oil prices will likely increase the output of ethane, especially from the Permian. So we are watching it, but we continue to believe that ethane supply will be sufficient, if not in excess, as we move through the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. You may go ahead. DonCarson: Yes. Thank you. Bob, a question on some of your growth plans. You mentioned that you are looking to secure more propylene. Can you sort of define how much you are looking to secure? And what would be the format? I notice you put a PDH plant on there. And while you have some experience running those in your joint ventures, PDH certainly hasn't been the most reliable way to source propylene lately. Would you look at another metathesis unit? Or what other options do you have on the table? Bob Patel : Well, I think, for us, very frankly, PDH would be the leading case because with the metathesis it's sort of an optimization tool that we have. And it doesn't always run full. It depends on propylene relative to ethylene price. And I think some of the challenges that you mentioned on PDH is a couple of things. One is, some of the most recent PDHs are the largest of their kind that have ever been built. So that brings complexity by itself. And much like ethylene crackers, that could take a bit of time to kind of iron out some of the bugs and work through on some of the startup issues. But the way we are kind of thinking about this is that we are a fairly significant buyer of propylene and if it's really kind of a make versus buy decision. But I see us as continuing to be a merchant buyer of propylene even if we were to build a world-scale PDH plant. And in terms of operability, that wouldn't hold us back from considering PDH. I think it's just uniqueness because of the first and second of this kind in terms of scale that are being built today. Operator : Thank you. David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Bob, on your slide 18, detailing your cadence of new investments, I am struck by the lack of a new ethylene cracker. You only have a small expansion over the next eight years. And given your positive view of U.S. ethylene, why isn't there a greenfield ethylene cracker in the longer term horizon? Thank you. Bob Patel : Yes. So David, we run early with our debottlenecks and so we focused quite a bit on ethylene over the last four, five years and so really now our focus is to consume more of that ethylene internally and convert it to polyethylene. I think we are still going to be a merchant seller of ethylene, but likely less so than we are today. So when I think about sort of the opportunity set in front of us with more polyethylene potential given the amount of ethylene we have, a PDH polypropylene here, perhaps PP in Europe, continuing to execute our PO/TBA, I think we have many other high return opportunities before we would consider a new cracker. I do think at some point we will undertake the analysis on that and it's just more a matter of phasing. And also I like the fact that our organic growth program is targeting multiple value chains. So we have ethylene, polyethylene, propylene, polypropylene and propylene, PO/TBA. So it gives us some diversity, if you will, as well in terms of our growth program. Operator : Thank you. Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners, you may go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Bob, with regard to the refinery, each quarter improved as 2017 progressed. Meanwhile, with the reduction in tax rate, one would think that separation could result in a lower tax bill than you might have thought last time around. So in that context, can you update us on your strategic thinking as it relates to the refinery? Bob Patel : Yes. Good morning Kevin. Our focus has really been on improving the operation. We know we can run better and we demonstrated that last year. In fact, it was one of the few assets that ran through the hurricane even if at reduced rates. So we are firmly focused on that. We see the IMO opportunity getting closer. There's a wide-ranging set of views around how it will impact light-heavy differentials, but this is a really premier asset with significant scale and in the amount of sour crude processing capability and coking capacity we have. So we are just going to focus on running it reliably and let's see what this IMO opportunity brings. We think there's some upside. And as the year progresses and we get towards the end of the year, I think we will have even more visibility about the magnitude of that upside. So frankly, that's our focus today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Just have a two-part question. The first is, how much does your cash tax rate go up in 2018? And what happens to the cash tax rate in 2019? And secondly, in table 11, you isolate your pension settlement charge for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $58 million, but I think you took a charge of $20 million this quarter but you haven't isolated that as an item. Why is that? Thomas Aebischer : Thanks for the question on the tax rate. So the cash tax rate, as I have said in my prepared remarks, for 2018, we expect, if you start with an ETR of 21%, the guidance we have given, the rate from that guidance of 21% will be effective tax rate on the cash tax rate we are expecting somewhere in the area of three to five percentage points higher cash tax rate. The reason why this has mainly to do with taxes into some of the European countries, especially Germany, now where we pay actual taxes now in 2018 taxes for years of 2015, 2016 and also 2017. So that's the main driver for the higher tax rate. Obviously, your question is absolutely correct. Now looking to future years, 2019 and the years beyond that, we expect the cash tax rate to be clearly below the 21%. So 2018 is an exceptional year due to the reasons I have explained and in 2019 and years thereafter, cash tax rate below the 21% of ETR. And on the pension charge, yes, that's correct. So we had a pension charge in December of 2017, also related to Germany, the reason for that charge was it's a multi-employer pension plan. And we had some of it is due to reduction of the discount rate that impacted it. And we also had pension settlement charges where we took advantage from lump-sum payments in 2016 and you have mentioned that correct amount too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. You may go ahead. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Moving to EAI, can you talk about how MTO dynamics are impacting you in China and I guess also in intermediates and derivatives? And related to that, could you talk about the naphtha price outlook and your use of advantaged feedstocks in Europe going forward? Bob Patel : Yes. So good morning Jim. On MTO, certainly, given where global operating rates have been in ethylene, MTO continues to be the last increment of supply for Asia and therefore for the rest of the world. And you can see that evidenced in ethylene prices over in Asia. And to the extent that there's a delta between that and naphtha based cost, it certainly affords EAI a reasonable margin in terms of ethylene. And you rightly point out the tie to our intermediates business. As there's a call on the methanol, we see methanol values rise and margins rise. So there's a dual benefit for the MTO being in the money. As we look into 2018, our sense is, given that operating rates are so high that during seasonally strong periods, likely MTO is still going to be needed in a very meaningful way. And so I would expect that continue. Operator : Thank you. P.J. Juvekar from Citi, you may go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Bob Patel : Good morning P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Bob, on slide 13, you show your effective operating rates remaining close to 95% through 2020. My question is, can the global system run at 95% effective rate day-in and day-out, given the age of the plants, et cetera when we just saw that temperatures dropped in the Gulf Coast and the six plants went down? So where do you think global system can run sustainably? Thank you. Bob Patel : Yes. Thank you, P.J. I think at these levels, it's been difficult to sustain. And as you think about new, very large crackers starting up, much like I described with PDH, there's a lot of challenge in the ramp-up. They are very, very capable companies who have undertaken these expansions, but they are very complex process units. And so I suspect, as we have seen in the past when operating rates have been this high or stayed this high, markets are very sensitive to small unplanned outages as there's not enough margin. So I think the consequence is, first of all, MTO will be needed more consistently. Secondly, you could see a propensity for ethylene prices to rise when there's some unplanned downtime. And so we will just kind of have to watch that. But that's been our point the last couple of years that we don't really see a large drop in the operating rates. And when you are in the mid-90s like we are today, even if you are at 93% for a year, during seasonal peak periods, you are actually running in the upper 90s. So we consider that to be a very tight market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. You may go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Good morning gentlemen. Bob Patel : Good morning. Frank Mitsch : I wanted to follow-up on the share buyback. I just wanted to make sure that I was understanding this correctly. So you set up a 10b5-1 plan so that you can buy back stock regardless if you were in possession of material nonpublic information. And it was predicated on where the share prices were trading. And you set that price at a level where you were interested in buying the stock was lower than where the shares were trading throughout Q4. And so that's why there was no shares bought back during the quarter? Bob Patel : Well, so Frank, what we do is we, Thomas and I, sit together and we kind of look at where the current share price is, what's our expectation for cash flow and we set up a grid that, again, allows us to accomplish our objective of being opportunistic. And then we let that run its course. And then again, as we are doing currently, we are evaluating the next 10b5 plan. So yes, generally, you are correct. Operator : And our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Bob, you mentioned that CapEx would have about $3 billion through 2022 per year. So you are starting with $2.4 billion this year. How do you imagine the ramp? And as a second part of this question, does this $3 billion average assume that most or all of the projects on the slide 18 actually get executed? Bob Patel : Yes. So the ramp will be in 2019 will be pretty close to $3 billion and in 2020 will be at $3 billion or a little above. It assumes most of those projects go forward, yes. And what drives that number today is our PO/TBA project is a fairly significant investment. So as we get into the construction and sort of the peak of the spending for that project, which will be 2019 and 2020, that drives those numbers. And then you will see those come off in 2021 even though we are going to continue with these other projects. The PO/TBA project by itself is pretty significant. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. You may go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Obviously, we have seen propane prices going up recently. And obviously, they have taken up propylene prices as well. So my question to you is, on the naphtha-based ethylene margin side of it, do you see this being a sustainable sort of boost for naphtha-based ethylene margins, number one? And number two, how should we also think about this as an input for you guys on the polypropylene side of things? Bob Patel : So first of all, Hassan, I think part of the driver for the polypropylene price increase has been some of the challenges on startup of a couple of very large PDH units here and one of those companies is a merchant seller of propylene. So I think that's been a pretty significant driver of propylene prices in the very near term. Propane prices coming up certainly contributed to some of that. I think propylene, as it has been recently, will continue to be somewhat dynamic in terms of price. And it doesn't really affect our thinking in terms of our new polypropylene plant because if you think about if we do build PDH and we are thinking about propane to polypropylene essentially and if I think around the propane side of that equation with the Permian ramping up, more ethane, more NGLs, we think there's going to be lots of propane. And we think that the PDH-based polypropylene can be economical here in the U.S. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. You may go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. A question just around the M&A opportunity. The projects you show come in somewhere around four to five times EBITDA. You guys trade a little bit over seven. It doesn't look like there's anything in the market that would kind of sell in the private market anywhere close to that. So if you do a deal, what should we expect to see from an EBITDA multiple? And then would it be higher than where you trade then with synergies you get lower? Or do you think you can actually buy stuff that's cheaper than your multiple currently? Bob Patel : Duffy, the ultimate goal is about value creation for the long term. And I know those words are easily said. But look, I will tell you, we are focused on that. When we think about whatever it might be and we think about synergies, we think about cost, operational synergies. And I will tell you very frankly, we are well positioned today with our cash position, with the balance sheet and so on. I don't feel that we have to go do something right now. You are going to see us continue to be patient, be value minded and think about how do we apply our strengths to create value. And the kind of position we have today, it affords us a lot of flexibility going into whatever sort of market environment exists. So I don't feel the urge that we have got to go out and do something because we have all this flexibility. And I don't think you should expect that that is going to change anytime soon. We will again be very value-minded. Operator : Thank you. Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein, you may go ahead. Jonas Oxgaard : Hi. Good morning guys. Bob Patel : Good morning. Jonas Oxgaard : Bob, you were talking about the supply, but can you talk a little bit on the demand side? It looked like demand was surprisingly strong last year and now with the impact of Chinese recycling, it looks even stronger. What are you seeing in the marketplace? And how are you thinking about it for the next year or two? Bob Patel : Jonas, we are seeing very good demand at the moment. And if you think about last year, especially in the U.S. with first of all, in polyethylene in a tight market had a very, very strong year because of more onshore oil and gas drilling and so on. Industry exports actually declined significantly in 2017 from the U.S. And certainly for our company, they declined dramatically. So if you assume that global demand for high-density polyethylene, for example, grows at 4%. Typically, given that there's a lot of packaging and things that are more nondurable in nature, I actually think that there's a potential for even higher growth catching up from last year's constrained environment from a supply standpoint. And from the U.S., because we had to cut back so much on exports, I think getting back to more traditional or more recent averages on exports in the U.S., that creates demand for U.S. based production. So I am quite constructive. And as I cited some of those statistics, supply growth for high-density polyethylene is about 4%, 2017 to 2018 and demand growth, I think, should be at least that. So I think we are going to see pretty good conditions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. You may go ahead, sir. John Roberts : Thanks. Bob, the next wave of shale-based chemical investments, whether in the olefin or methanol chains has a number of projects that have been sitting on the shelves. Do you think the current expensing of CapEx that begins next year will cause some acceleration in the groundbreaking of the projects industry-wide? Or do the lead times required and engineering constraints just make that unlikely? Bob Patel : Yes. So John, it's a great question and one that I have been asked in different forums. I can't speculate what others will do, but I will tell you how we are thinking about it. I continue to encourage my team to think about the investment logic and sort of why we would build something. And I think tax reform, it might add to returns. It's not the reason to undertake organic growth because it could change frankly. And as you rightly point out, the cycle is somewhat long in terms of building. So from LyondellBasell standpoint and from my standpoint, there's got to be solid investment logic and we would think about undertaking this investment in the prior tax regime or in the new one. And so we will have to see how that plays out. But even if some of the capital spending increases, we are probably looking at five years from now or so before we see capacity hit the market. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir. Bob Koort : Thanks very much. I appreciate you guys going long to get the questions in. Bob, your large North American peer opined yesterday that maybe this Chinese recycling ban wasn't really going to affect virgin PE growth rates and that scrap might end up somewhere else and get reprocessed. Have you seen any impact from that at all or do you think it's not really that relevant in the grand scheme of things? Bob Patel : Well, I think, Bob, in the near term, we haven't seen anything, but I do think that some of it will get dislocated and move to other countries. But that takes time and there's a bit of a space or a lag in between what's happened in terms of regulations in China and where that product shows up. The other thing I would mention is that, I think globally there's more scrutiny on the quality of recycled resins. So I think it probably provides some tailwind here in the next 12 to 18 months until that ends up somewhere else or a part of it does. And that's the period where we are seeing more capacity. So I think directionally, it probably still helps us. Thomas Aebischer : Yes. Bob, I think you have to consider that the recycling industry in China took nearly a decade to build up. And so that won't happen overnight somewhere else. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to gauge your interest in the idea of ethylene exports out of the U.S. Your long ethylene and U.S. ethylene trades at a discount to other regions. So I guess, how do you weigh the advantages of a long-term shipping commitment for ethylene versus the option of building out more ethylene derivative capacity? Bob Patel : Yes. Good morning Matthew. And I am sure you are referencing the announcement that came out earlier in the week. I think generally, from an industry standpoint, I kind of look at it as, it's another derivative that's being built for ethylene. So I think that's directionally good. For our company, we would see a terminal like that as being opportunistic. And we might engage through the stock market to do some of that. Today, I don't know that we would participate on a structural basis in something like that. Our focus is on supplying some of our strategic ethylene customers here in the U.S. and directionally building out more polyethylene capacity. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir. DanRizzo: This is Dan Rizzo, on for Laurence. The opportunity you guys mentioned in compounding, are you planning solutions for specific models? And can these compounds be applied to other end-markets? Bob Patel : Yes. So on the compounding, our focus has been in auto, in polypropylene compounding and generally, the direction is for lightweighting of vehicles. And we sit with OEMs and we discuss what's possible. And that's been our focus. And if you think about it, we are able to then develop polypropylene and catalysts that enable the compounds which lightweight vehicles. So that's our focus. I do think, to your point, that that methodology can translate to other segments and our capability is certainly there. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. It would be my pleasure to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bob Patel for any closing comments. Thank you, sir. Bob Patel : All right. Well, thank you, again, for all the great questions. Let me offer a few closing remarks. I hope what you see today is that our strategy and approach remains focused and consistent. Markets are tighter than we anticipated as we enter 2018 in a good position to accommodate the capacity additions across our industry. At LyondellBasell, our focus is, first and foremost, on safe, reliable, cost efficient operations. That earns our position as a supplier of choice for our customers for today and tomorrow. We are building out our organic growth pipeline, as I described. We are targeting multiple value chains. And our next investment will start up in the middle of next year in 2018. We are working diligently to pursue value driven growth for you, our owners. So thank you very much for your interest and we look forward talking to you again soon. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

During today's call, we will focus on the first quarter results, the current environment and our near-term outlook. That being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Alright, thanks Dave. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter. The LyondellBasell business portfolio continues to exhibit superior cash flow generation as our growth strategy built momentum to deliver additional value for our shareholders. Reliable operations and improving margins for several products provided an outstanding start for the New Year. Our first quarter diluted earnings were $3.11 per share. Both EPS and net income results for the first quarter represented a significant increase relative to the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding the one-time tax benefits that occurred in the fourth quarter. EBITDA was $1.9 billion, representing an 11% improvement over the fourth quarter and an 18% improvement over the first quarter 2017. Strong performance in our intermediates and derivatives business generated record quarterly EBITDA for that segment. In the first quarter, we announced an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend, bringing it to $1 per share for the quarter. This increase reflects the confidence in our ability to continue providing strong returns to our shareholders through business cycles. Our growth program advanced in the first quarter with our announcement to acquire A. Schulman and the start of our Quality Circular Polymers or QCP joint venture with SUEZ. While the A. Schulman acquisition will extend our range of innovative products and establish our position in high growth markets, partnering with SUEZ in the QCP JV, allows us to establish a leading position in the expanding market for recycled materials. Our organic growth projects also progressed during the first quarter. Construction on our Hyperzone HDPE project is on track for startup in 2019. And groundbreaking for our PO/TBA project is scheduled for this summer. Slide 5 highlights the continued improvements to the strong safety performance achieved by our employees and contractors during the first quarter. As you know, we believe that our commitment to help safety and environmental performance helps to drive reliable operations and ultimately profitability. Safety remains a top priority across our company and very pleased to see continued improvement over the first months of 2018. During the first quarter, chain margins across ethylene and polyethylene remained quite strong due to robust global demand growth. Slide 6 illustrates some of the growing markets where our polyethylene enjoys leading positions, market such as film and sheet for packaging, high-density polyethylene for pressure pipe, plastic fuel tanks for transportation and wire and cable jacketing for electrical products. Global polyethylene market demand grew by 4% during the first quarter and the North American capacity additions will be needed to satisfy China's substantial and growing trade deficit for these plastics. And now, Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the quarter. Thomas Aebischer : Thanks you, Bob, and good morning to all of you. Please turn now to Slide 7 which shows our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. During the quarter strong polyethylene demand benefitted both Olefins and Polyolefins segment, a strong margin for styrene and other Intermediates and Derivatives products resulted in a quarter EBITDA record for the segment. On Slide 8, we provide a picture of cash generation and use. During the first quarter we generated over $1 billion of cash from operating activities and approximately half of this amount was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to view dividend as core to our capital deployment strategy and as Bob previously mentioned in the first quarter, we announced an 11% increase through our quarterly dividend, raising it to $1 per share. While we typically wait until the May board meeting to consider dividend increases, the combination of our improving view of market conditions and the benefits of U.S. tax reform provided the impetus for a larger and earlier dividend increase for 2018. Our investments in maintenance and growth capital expenses were $429 million during the first quarter driven by planned maintenance turnarounds, the new Hyperzone plant and early work on the PO/TBA project. During the first quarter our cash and liquid investment balance grew by $63 million. Over the past 12 months, we generated more than $5.5 billion of cash from operating activities and used approximately $2.3 billion for dividends and share repurchases of the investments in our capital program and other financial activities, the cash and liquid investment balance increased by approximately $1.3 billion. Our share buyback program continued during the quarter with the Company repurchasing another 1.3 million shares. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchases approximately 190 million shares or approximately 33% of the initial shares outstanding. In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early April, we recommend that our shareholders authorize a new repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares over the next 18 months.  Slide 9 provides a longer perspective on LyondellBasell's substantial and consistent cash generation from operating activities. In each of the five periods, operating activities have generated between $5 billion and $6 billion of cash. After our investments in capital expenditure, our trailing 12 months free cash flow was $4 billion and we finished the quarter with approximately $6.9 billion of liquidity. The bottom chart illustrates the consistency of our strong cash generation from operating activity as a percent of enterprise value relative to our industry peers. LyondellBasell leads the group with a strong and consistent ratio of approximately 13% and compares favorably to many of our more specialized peers. With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you very much. Bob Patel : Alright, thank you Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review our segment results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $780 million, a $4 million decline from the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2017 results included a LIFO inventory charge of $22 million. Relative to the previous quarter olefins results decreased by approximately $75 million, ethylene margin declined by approximately $0.02 per pound and volume decreased due to reduced derivative operating rates. Ethylene operating rates remain strong across our system during the first quarter averaging 90%. Approximately 80% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results improved by approximately $35 million. Polyethylene spreads over ethylene increased by approximately $0.02 per pound. During our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we would incur impacts from unusually cold weather during the third week of January. This event impacted the first quarter results by approximately $45 million, roughly two-thirds of this impact is in our O&P \u2013 Americas segments with most of the remainder in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Planned maintenance on one of our two crackers at Channelview negatively impacted the first quarter results by approximately $50 million. This work is near completion and the impact to the second quarter is estimated to be approximately $50 million. Over the past two months, spot ethylene prices have weakened due to strong industry supply, lower derivative operating rates and increased inventories. However, the polyethylene market remains tight and margins are robust. Industry consultants are predicting an increase in ethylene cracker downtime during the second quarter. This increased downtime combined with improved operating rates on downstream derivative units should result in a more balanced ethylene environment in the coming months. Turning to Slide 11, let's review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $518 million or $162 million higher than the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2017 results reflected LIFO inventory charges of $20 million and multi-employer pension charge of $20 million. Olefins result improved by approximately $70 million with ethylene margins increasing approximately $0.06 per pound. Our ethylene production volume increased due to the absence of fourth quarter maintenance at Wesseling site. Utilization of advantaged feedstocks decreased by 2% as co-product credit out weighted the higher cost of naphtha feedstock. Our crackers operated at a 95% rate during the first quarter exceeding industry performance by about 5%. Combined polyolefins results improved by approximately $50 million primarily due to higher sales volumes. During April, global markets remain tight to balance with increased maintenance across the industry during the spring months. Industry consultants are forecasting that three European crackers will be shut down for planned maintenance in the second quarter. On Slide 12, we highlight the strong performance of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. The first quarter EBITDA was $486 million, setting a quarterly record and representing an improvement over $76 million from the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2017 results reflected a LIFO inventory charge of $17 million. Results from propylene oxide and derivatives were relatively unchanged as margin improvement was offset by lower volumes. And increased margin for styrene was the primary driver for improved results of approximately $30 million in intermediate chemicals. Oxyfuels and related products results improved approximately $20 million, primarily due to higher margins. During April, we're seeing strength in oxyfuel margins as we enter the period of seasonally high demand and lower butane prices. Prices for styrene and methanol remain strong but are expected to continue to moderate as industry production capacity returns to the market. Now let's move to Slide 13 for a discussion of the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $63 million. The refinery continued operating at a strong rate of 252,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. The fourth quarter profitability benefited from the $38 million LIFO inventory adjustment and refining margins were relatively unchanged. The cost of RINs decreased relative to the fourth quarter. During April, our refinery has continued to operate near nameplate capacity and refining spreads have improved with higher seasonal demand. The Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased to $26 per barrel, a significant increase from the first quarter average. We believe this favorability could extend through the second quarter as we enter the summer driving season. Turning to Slide 14, let's take a closer look at the improvements in our operations and the outlook for our refinery. Operating rates improvement significant in 2017 and the upward trajectory continued during the first quarter. I'm proud of the dedication of our team and their efforts to improve reliability at the refinery, enabling a return to the high operating rates we've seen over the years from this asset. As many of you are aware, the International Maritime Organization is reducing the limit for sulfur in marine fuel oil from 3.5% to 0.5% effective January 1, 2020. Forward curves are already indicating that the distillate spread over Brent crude oil will improve by more than $2 per barrel by mid-2019 and more than $5 per barrel by mid-2020. When combined with improvements projected for light heavy crude oil differentials, this could result in a significant increase to the Maya 2-1-1 refining spread and substantial profitability improvements for our refinery. We will continue to monitor the implementation of these regulations over the coming months. But we believe the high coking, hydro treating and distillate capacities at our refinery leave us well positioned to benefit from these market developments. Please turn to Slide 15 for an update on the A. Schulman acquisition. With the combination of LyondellBasell's vertically integrated polypropylene compounding business and A. Schulman's agile customer focus across broad and growing markets, we are well positioned to deliver significant value for customers and our shareholders. Within one week of announcing the acquisition, we staffed our integration management officer and began work on detailed synergy and implementation planning for day one activities. I'm very pleased with the progress these teams have made. On March 16, we received United States antitrust clearance. We continue to anticipate that the transaction will close in the second half of 2018, subject to the remaining regulatory clearances and the A. Schulman shareholder vote scheduled for June 14. We look forward to updating you on the continued progress of this acquisition as we reach key milestones Turning to Slide 16, allow me to recap some highlights. LyondellBasell delivered strong Q1 results in a time when new capacity is coming to market in the U.S. Our global portfolio of businesses continues to generate resilient returns in a dynamic range of market conditions. In the first quarter, we achieved record quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivative segment. We increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and continued to deliver strong cash generation. We continued to see strong demand for our polyolefin products across all regions. That supported solid chain margins for our O&P businesses. The I&D segment benefited from strong margins across multiple business lines and our refinery ran near nameplate capacity. Looking forward, we are seeing typical seasonal spread improvements for transportation fuels that support both our oxyfuels and refining business. As downstream derivative units in the industry ramp up to full capacity, we anticipate ethylene and polyethylene will move to more balanced position. The recent increase in oil prices and strong global demand should continue to provide support for polyolefin pricing. Our organic growth program is progressing very well with construction of our Hyperzone HDPE plant on track for startup in 2019 and formal groundbreaking for our PO/TBA plant scheduled this summer. Preliminary engineering work is underway to support a final investment decision for our North American PDH and PP plants by early 2019. With that said, we're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. They polyethylene pricing in Europe just remains at a substantial premium to the rest of the world. What are the factors that enable that, and do you see that as being sustainable? Bob Patel : Good morning, Steve. First of all the operating rates have continued to increase in Europe as there is no new capacity and demand is growing at a modest rate. So, the units over there for the industry are running at much, much higher rates. It's also a relatively more complex market than what you might find in China or in Asia generally speaking. So, in some ways it's a little bit harder market to serve. So, we do continue to believe that there will be some resilience in this premium as time goes on. Steve Byrne : And the other factor I wanted your view on Bob was just U.S. polyethylene producer inventory level seem to be high in March and it just doesn't seem to square with this dynamic about low ethylene pricing because of the delay in startup of downstream derivatives, unless the downstream derivatives are other ethylene derivatives and not polyethylene is there logic in all of it to you? Bob Patel : The inventories in polyethylene, they may be higher than average but remember there is going to be more production as well. So, I do think that some of the derivative \u2013 the polyethylene units have not been steady in terms of their operation. It's been more up and down or not producing the targeted grades. I think we'll know a lot more here in Q2 as we reach kind of a newer normal with these new units. Steve Byrne : Very good. Thank you. Bob Patel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Arun, your line is open. Please check your mute feature. Arun, your line is open. You may ask your question. And we'll go on to the next question. That comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. You may ask your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Good morning. Bob Patel : Good morning P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Bob, on polyethylene, several cities have been tracking down on single-use plastic bags. What's your view on that and how does it impact polyethylene demand. And then related to that, you bought a stake in recycling company recently, was that in anticipation of this trend? Bob Patel : On the single-use PE bags, that's been around for a while in different parts of the U.S. as well as globally. And some of that impact has already been felt. It's a combination of LL and HD that see the impact. I think it remains to be seen as the impact is greater than what we know today. With respect to our acquisition and the joint venture of with SUEZ in this QCP venture, that's really anticipating a broader move towards brand owners like Procter & Gamble and IKEA and Unilever looking for more recycled content in their products. And as you think, circularity is going to be a very, very important feature of going forward. So, you know with SUEZ, I think what's unique is that we've partnered with a waste handling company who brings to the venture clean and segregated waste which is very good feedstock for recycling. In the past, the challenge was the recycling has been that what comes into a recycling plant is mixed waste and so you know the end-use of that is more limited. I think we have a very unique opportunity with QCP to really impact in terms of circular economy. P.J. Juvekar: Yeah. And secondly on, you know in the past, you've always given your views on ethane and NGLs. Ethane prices have gone up slightly, not running up, but maybe inching up. So, can you give us your outlook on ethane with these new crackers, but also more drilling in the Permian and takeaway capacity there? Thank you. Bob Patel : Yeah. There have been P.J. a lot of announcements from the midstream about more pipelines coming from the Permian to Mont Belvieu or to the Gulf Coast. And so, we continue to believe that there is ample ethane to supply the new capacity closer to the Gulf Coast. So, from the Permian, from the Rockies, Eagle Ford and so on, and while yes there is a bit more of a premium, you'll recall that we've been saying for a couple of years that we're inspecting the frac spread to be $0.07 to $0.10 and we're kind of in that range. So, there is lots of ethane available in my opinion. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Bob, could you just talked about you know over the next six months or so as we get 2, maybe 2.5 cracker startups, as a lot of that product destined for the Asian market. What \u2013 how do you think about the spread between the U.S. P price and the Asian P price? And do you think that needs to compress, and do you think different grades will see different price trends, as that capacity comes online? Bob Patel : Good morning Vincent. Well there is a lot there. So, let me see if I can address it in pieces. First of all, if you step back and look at operating rates globally, it's still pretty high operating rates. I think the unique feature about this cycle if you will or this phase of build out on capacity, we're coming off of full operating rates essentially. And this year it seems to me that supply growth may exceed demand growth by 1% or 2%, still leaving us with operating rates that are greater than 90%. With higher oil prices, prices have come up in Asia. And when you look at the differential between the U.S. and Asia on like-for-like grades, it's about $0.05. It's not as great as what we may have had last year or the year before. For the remainder, for other product grades that are more U.S. centric, I would expect there to be \u2013 still be some delta as we've historically had. So, you really kind of have to look at the price and separate it into the grades that are exported and like-for-like, and that spread of $0.05 is not a lot in my opinion. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you. And Thomas, if I could just ask you, you know, you generated $1.9 billion of EBITDA and I believe there is only about $1 billion of cash flow from operations. So, could you just walk us from one to the other? Anything usual? Thomas Aebischer : Right. Yes. So, obviously you have seen the net working capital development during \u2013 you'll see obviously all the detail in the 10-Q. We have net working capital slide, the net working capital buildup sort of variance, and that explains the most significant piece of it. So, it's you know compared to first quarter of 2017, when you look at it on a free cash flow basis, actually a significant increase on free cash flow. Vincent Andrews : But was it inventory, what part of the working capital is driving it? Thomas Aebischer : It's basically inventory, yes. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Bob. Can you talk about how different policy changes regarding ethanol in China may affect the MTBE market over time? Bob Patel : I think you know Jeff, I think you're referring to E10, and so we'll have to see how that develops. But we still see a good MTBE market globally and even if there is more ethanol, MTBE is still going to be an important oxygenates going forward. And given our PO/TBA investment being here in the U.S., we're capitalizing on cheaper butane and we see good prospects for that project. Jeff Zekauskas : And then for Thomas, how much did you spend to buy back 1.3 million shares in the first quarter? Thomas Aebischer : Right. So, we spent \u2013 and you look at the cash flow statement, you will see it. We spent for the 1.3 million or shares, $190 million. However as we disclosed in the 10-Q, we have a time lag between you know the share count and the actual cash outflow of about two days. So, when you take the 1.3 million shares, you will see all these details in the Q. The actual spend including that two day time lag is $139 million. Jeff Zekauskas : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Yeah. Good morning fellows. Bob Patel : Good morning. Duffy Fischer : A question just, we had the announcement from CDI a couple of days ago that China is going to go ahead with its first ethane cracker and ship the ethane from the U.S. So, two question there; one, roughly how many announcements like that do you think we'll get over the next couple of years? And two, what's the differential in cost between using ethane producing pellets here, shipping the pellets to China versus shipping the ethane and producing the pellets there, which obviously condensing ethane is going to be more expensive. But what's your best guess with that relative difference is in cost structure? Bob Patel : So, Duffy, first of all, you know it's difficult to predict or forecast what other announcements may come. But if you step back and think about development of the Middle East petrochemical industry, it is essentially premised on cheaper ethane, but the producers there chose to solidify the ethane and move it in the form of polyethylene or produce liquid chemicals which are much more inexpensive to ship. And I would think that, that will still be sort of the prevailing sentiment as we think through how this ethane will come to market. In terms of cost differentials, just kind of as a rule of thumb, you know I think about the cost of shipping ethane in terms of cost of ethylene as being $450 a ton or something in that range as opposed to \u2013 so you know north of $0.20 a pound as opposed to polyethylene which including sort of putting it in bags is $0.08 or something like that. So, there is a significant delta in terms of shipping gas versus polyethylene. Duffy Fischer : Fair enough. Then just one follow-up, on your I&D segment, couple of smaller businesses have done pretty well lately with the methanol, acetic acid moving better and styrene obviously is been doing well. Is there any thought internally to maybe moving towards organic growth in those and trying to make those a bigger part of the portfolio? Bob Patel : Duffy, you know we've been over the last year or so, or two years in thinking through our strategy in I&D and we have you know a range of options in front of us that we will consider. Nothing I'm prepared to discuss today. Duffy Fischer : Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Bob Patel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. You may ask your question. Aleksey Yefremov : Q1 derivatives results were $55 million year-over-year. What was the driver behind this and could you talk broadly about you know supply demand and what are your expectations for earnings in PO this year compared to 2017? Bob Patel : So, the driver was really in styrene monomer as a co-product in the production of PO. If PO margins have been fairly stable and up some, we expect that to be \u2013 to continue. Volumes should increase as we go into the second quarter, so we're quite \u2013 continue to be quite constructive about our PO business. I think Alex, when you think about our I&D business, and step back from the various products, the key feature, as we transit from Q1 to Q2 is really going to be about moving into driving season and how oxyfuels will contribute to an improving earnings in I&D. We see the ethylene crack spreads have come up, which benefits our oxyfuel business. Butane typically gets cheaper in the summer months. We saw that actually early this year, indicating that there is plenty of butane supply and volumes typically go up because of driving season. So, I think all of that ultimately as we move in Q2, as we do in prior years, oxyfuel result should be an important feature. Aleksey Yefremov : Understood. Thank you. And if I can follow-up on merchant ethylene in your view of strengthening ethylene prices going forward. I guess if PE units will ramp that make sense, but would ethylene crackers, new ethylene cracker also ramp productions and maybe it sounds as it's going to be integrated the increase. How would that's strengthened supply demand for merchant ethylene? Bob Patel : So in Q1, we had operating rates for crackers very high, while the derivatives didn't run as well in the industry, and some of the new units were more up and down in polymers as opposed to in the cracker business. Recent ethylene prices \u2013 spot ethylene prices have been pretty close to the ethane cash cost. So, I know this is on investors' mind, so let me just address sort of the impact to our company. First of all, we sell about 25% of our ethylene into the merchant market, and to size sort of the impact for you. About a 5% change in the spot margin translates to about $80 million per year impact in profitability. So, it's very modest when you think in those terms. And I do think as we move through the year and as the new polyethylene units start to run more fully, we should expect that ethylene will come more into balance. If it doesn't, then upsize the impact for you, about a 5% change in spot margin, translate for a full year to $80 million impact on earnings. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Bob. Bob Patel : Okay. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good Morning. Bob, if China were to proceed with tariffs on certain resins including low density and linear low density polyethylene. Does it matter or not matter for U.S. Gulf Coast producers? And if it does matter, maybe you could share your thoughts on what might happen with trade flows pricing potential for resin substitution and those sorts of issues? Bob Patel : I think, first of all, Kevin, yes, they're sort of around us. Our company is more focused on high density and followed by low density, and then we have very little linear low. And I think they'll be a combination of those things that you mentioned. You could see some trade flow shift, but the near term impact will be higher prices in Asia. And substitution from LL to HD and used applications, some of that can be done, but I don't think it's substantial. So it really is \u2013 when I think about tariffs and the trade topics, we are assessing longer term impacts. I think the near term impacts are higher prices frankly. David Kinney : Kevin, this is Dave. If you go back to the chart that Bob showed on slide 6, the 38 billion pounds trade deficit for polyethylene in China, I think that's really the driving force behind us. China does need this polyethylene one way or another, and whether the trade lane shift or not, you know is more of a final question on that. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you. And then as a follow-up if I may. Your O&P America's earnings held pretty close to flat in 1Q sequentially, perhaps better than some of the benchmark levels might suggest. I was wondering if you could speak to that for example or are you making more money in the deficits these days with the disparity between ethylene monomer in the value of propylene or perhaps your other factors helping to support the earnings there. Bob Patel : But we have a very good polypropylene market and that helps the segment. And I think it also speaks to the mix in terms of our participation in polyethylene. So, Kevin again, we've talked about the resilience of our portfolio and about our O&P business, and I think another Q1 demonstrates that. David Kinney : And Kevin, I think if you look at the polyethylene price realization that we had relative to some of the non-market adjustments that you saw out there by some of the consultants that I think the real market really wasn't as bad as was portrayed in some of those non-market adjustments. I don't think that occurred in every market and every product line that's out there for polyethylene. Kevin McCarthy : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Partners. You may ask your question. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Bob, I wanted to revisit the China trade question, but not from a product pricing perspective, more from a feedstock perspective. Interestingly, obviously propylene seems to be a part of the tariffs, while polypropylene does not. And if I have my numbers right, it seems that around 15% of all U.S. propane exports are China done. So I mean, is it fair to assume that if this tariff regime were to kick in, I mean you'd start seeing a bit of a glut of propylene in the domestic market, which I guess would depressed propylene pricing may even provide a ceiling for ethylene rising and would probably be extremely favorable for the polypropylene type of things. Is that the right way of thinking about them? Bob Patel : Yeah. Look, I think that there is a potential outcome. And when you think about propane, first of all, there is not a lot of new export terminals that are being built. On the other hand, there is more propane supply coming from new NGLs. So, if China were to pull back, then yes, I agree with you. I think the propane mines would increase, and therefore propane would be much more competitive with ethane than it is today. So, for the scenario you've outlined is a very big possibility that that how it plays out. Hassan Ahmed : Understood, understood. Changing gears a bit, you know obviously a strong results on the I&D side. And as I looked at certain volumes within individual products, it seems both on a year-over-year as well as sequential basis, the asset yield volumes were down significantly. I mean down 28% quarter-on-quarter, 35% year-on-year. What was going on over there? Was this sort of maybe a strategy on your part to this sort of reduce volumes to get better pricing or was there may be an outage there and those sort of things? David Kinney : Yeah. Hassan, this is Dave. We did have some operational issues with our acetyl segment during the first quarter of this year, but you are absolutely right the margin improvements have been substantial. Hassan Ahmed : I mean would you be able to break out what sort of impact EBITDA impact that outage resulted in? Bob Patel : It wasn't really material for the whole segment. Hassan Ahmed : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Thanks. The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question. David Begleiter : Thanks. Good morning. Bob, just on PE in the very near term, would you expect some polyethylene price erosion in this April May \u2013 in this May June timeframe perhaps? Bob Patel : We are in a seasonally strong period for polyethylene. So, as I had mentioned in couple of the prior calls, typically for polyethylene and polyolefin is generally the annual growth we see in the first three quarters of the year, so \u2013 and this year is shaping up very similarly. And with higher oil prices and higher prices in Asia, demand is going very well. I see a very constructive market for the next quarter or two, and we'll have to see how Q4 develops, but until then seems to me that this supply is coming just in time to meet the demand growth globally. David Begleiter : Very good. And just on styrene Bob, there is been a recent announcement by a U.S. player to add new capacity. Were you surprised by that announcement? Bob Patel : Well, now a days, a very little surprises me David. But our focus has been more on POSM, and as we think about styrene production. And I think that in Asia, we're going to see fuel SM as a more prevalent way of producing propylene oxide and therefore styrene monomer are happen to think that that's still the most economical at least for our company. So we can't speak for others. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Bob Koort : Thanks. Good morning. Question maybe around the capital deployment, a couple of items. One, obviously you guys started buying back stock, it was like maybe this bearish stock price wasn't dissimilar from the fourth quarter. Did you guys raise your threshold bar of what price you are willing to pay or what sort of change the dynamic there? And then, secondly Bob, can you talk a little bit about further inorganic opportunities. How you see that market developing? Are you guys active in looking or is it quite a down? Give us some sense there? Thanks. Bob Patel : So, first of all, on share repurchases. You know every quarter, as I mentioned in prior calls, we really review intrinsic value and we think through what's ahead in the quarter where are we trading. And we update our grid that I've talked about in the past, and so this quarter was no different. I think what's important for investors to recognize is that company like ours from time to time had material non-public information. We are not able to get into the market immediately after we release earnings and with the new 10b5 plan. In the case of Q1, we hadn't announced. Well we announced the A. Schulman acquisition in mid-February. We also moved up our dividend announcement to the end of February. We believe both of those to be material on public information. And so, we really can't get in the market to buy back shares until very end of February. So you know these things, these are normal practices and we keep our value of our firm updated very regularly as we think through buybacks. And we said before that we want to be opportunistic, so we can maximize the bang for our bucket if you will and you'll continue to see us doing that. On the inorganic side, we've said in the past that what we look for our businesses that fit from a strategic standpoint and businesses where we know we can apply our strengths clean values. We are very value-minded company in everything we do and I think that you should expect that to continue as we consider a range of growth options, whether they're inorganic or organic. Bob Koort : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. You may ask your question. Jim Sheehan : Bob, with the changes in the International Maritime Organization helping your business, how do you think that refining in your strategic options for that business going forward? Bob Patel : Yeah. So Jim, that's been consistent in my message on this, is that our focus right now is to have strong and reliable operations at the refinery. And I think we're on a good track there and I want to make sure our team continues to focus on that. I think we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. It's indeed the forward curves turned out to be true. As we get closer, it seems to me that this is a real opportunity, especially for any refinery like ours that has so much coking capacity and its ability to process large volumes of sour crude oil. So, we're again value-minded, building up my last comment, we are very value minded when we think about these things. And today our focus is to run well and I think there is great potential in our refinery that we own. Jim Sheehan : Great. And then your polyethylene business, you've highlighted the company's strong presence in a variety of end markets. I am curious about what's been happening in the wire and cable market? Recently I think there is been some softening of demand there. Do you think that's temporary or do you think there are more extensive issues in that end market to contend with? Bob Patel : I think that's probably temporary because if you just step back and think about infrastructure spending in developing markets. And potentially, here at home, if there is more infrastructures' spending that stimulated by the government, I think that should be a good market and one that we quite like. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] One next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question. Frank Mitsch : Yes. Hi. Good morning. And congratulations on a nice quarter and even further congratulations on the improvement in the sound quality of the conference call. Frank Mitsch : Thank you for your recognition, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Absolutely, it no longer sounds like you're in an underground bunker. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, based on your obviously record in I&D, it sounds like oxyfuels is doing better, you know styrene has the sustainability, you're going have more pounds of acetyls. Is there any reason that we would not expect to see another record in I&D in Q2? Bob Patel : Well, Frank, let's see how markets develop. I think the more volatile parts of our I&D portfolio are styrene and methanol, difficult to predict were those will go. Directionally, oxyfuel should be better in Q2 compared to Q1. So, let's see where we end up about a quarter from now. Frank Mitsch : I take that as yes. And then Thomas, you mention that you paid $119 million, however there is a two day lag and you will see that it was actually $139. So, it says that you guys bought back $20 million of stock in two days. Can you clarify that for me? And is that kind of the run rate now that you're out of the quiet periods of the Schulman deal and the dividend hike. Thomas Aebischer : No. This is you know you have this [indiscernible] actually on share buybacks every quarter. So, when you look at the Q and you look at the amount of shares is closed and the cash outflow, you see that two day lag. And I cannot clarify obviously that we are buying at a certain pace. That obviously depends very much on any given day and the underlying share price. But I think what's important to know, is I think it was an earlier question ask about the fourth quarter, and we pullback shares again. So as we stated before, we find our share very attractive and that's why we continued buying back shares also at the level of wherever it was, under $110, under $111 or $107 a share. So that's what we continue to do so. Frank Mitsch : But just to clarify, so that's $20 million change in two days meant that you were very aggressive at the end of March. Is that how I should be thinking about that? Thomas Aebischer : No. I think when you just look at the share count, you will virtually see in March how much shares we pulled back, obviously, what's the corresponding share price is. And you can easily figure also, we'll see average share prices we have paid for as 1.3 million shares. Frank Mitsch : All right. Thank You. Bob Patel : Thank you, Frank. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. You may ask your question. John Roberts : Thank you, Bob. On IMO 2020, the fleet ownership period to be delaying their decision between onboard scrubbers for lower sulfur fuel, so there could be a wide range of scenarios. I suspect in terms of what happens. Is there any capital required few at any of the extremes of kind of the scenarios that can happen or it's really just an operating change. And the lead time that they'll have to make decisions on the scrubbers will give you plenty of lead time for you to make any changes in the refinery. Bob Patel : I don't. We don't have any capital that's earmarked for capitalizing on this IMO 2020. Again more broadly, I've been asking the team that's refinery, it really just focus on consistent reliable operations at nameplate capacity and we've been really, really focused on that. I think that is the biggest driver and positioning ourselves for what IMO 2020 could turn out to be. Thomas Aebischer : Yes, John. We actually completed our Tier 3 investment last year, so there is no further investment needed. We just need to run it well as Bob said. John Roberts : And then, in reading the Schulman proxy, it looks like one of the bidders wanted to split off the distribution and composites business. Do you view those parts of Schulman strategic to the deal or they something that maybe after the deal later on, you might separate out as well? Thomas Aebischer : So, we have not made any decisions on these businesses. Those are obviously smaller compared to the whole of Schulman, but we are going to look at all of that very carefully. And I'll just remind you that as we thought about this acquisition, it was about creating a new platform in our company in compounding and I am convinced that I think we have all of the ingredients to build a world class compounding business that will reach a multitude of markets. So we're going to all of that with an open mind and solving for value creation. John Roberts : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning, guys. Bob Patel : Good morning. Jonas Oxgaard : I want to ask whether there is a TRADE war with China or not. We're going to have to place a bunch of that polyethylene somewhere. We now have talked about it a little. I was curious about how are you thinking about Europe in all of this? Are you making preparations to send some more into Europe and I mean so what you think the impact of that is in the European market? Bob Patel : First of Jonas, I think the \u2013 given that European market is growing, albeit modestly at maybe 1% or 2% a year, eventually the need for imports into that market are then going to grow. And the needs for European market are very different than the Asian markets in terms of the types of products. So, as we think about our new investment in the Hyperzone technology, I think that plays very well to targeted exports from the U.S. to Europe to supplement what we already do over there. You know in my view, I think it's a better way to meet a modestly growing European business in polyethylene rather than build locally. So, trade war or not, I mean I think we really have to look at the kind of grades that are needed, and I do think there is a meaningful difference between the higher volume, more commodity grades that an Asian market might need compared to types that are needed in Europe. Jonas Oxgaard : And how does your export compete with the Middle Eastern ones which are going to Europe right now? Bob Patel : So, ethane costs here are pretty competitive with the new ethane cost in the Middle East. So, again, I think it's really \u2013 we look at asset by asset. We look at netbacks through various regions and we're optimizing for value. So, I think we could if we needed to export more product to Europe, we could do it very competitively from the U.S. And what benefits us is that, we already have a very large presence in Europe locally and so when I think about exports from the U.S., it's about supplementing production authority there. Jonas Oxgaard : Well. Okay. I was more thinking about the quality of the product coming out in the Middle East versus yours than the cost position? Bob Patel : I see. I think it depends on the type of technology that are deployed, but I really do believe this new Hyperzone polyethylene technology, it's going to be really unique in the high density space. And it will be the type of product that many, many European customers will want. And so, as we think about this one and the potential one you know in the next decade, we will certainly think about Europe as being part of the marketing plan on the new assets. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may ask your question. Matthew Blair : Good morning Bob. Coming back to the trade theme here, you know earlier this year we had China duties on styrene. Lyondell is the merchant and styrene seller. Could you talk about what kind of impact did you see on your styrene flows and perhaps pricing? And does that give you more or less comfort on potential tariffs from China on PE? Bob Patel : So, on styrene, you know so far we didn't see a lot of impact in terms of volumes. And as you can see from posted price is from different publication, here the price is held up quite well. I do think this is to be realistic to you Matthew. You know, I think this is something we have to watch with styrene. Here my moderate view about future in terms of styrene prices, so I think we'll just have to watch how all that develops. Part of the reason styrene prices also moved was because there were some unplanned outages and some of that production has returned to market. So, really difficult to predict or forecast how all of these tariffs and anti-dumping duties, how rebellion, how stinky are they going to be and how they impact. I think we'll know more as the year progresses. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Nicholas Cecero : This is Nick Cecero on for Laurence. Quick question on styrene, I was wondering if you can walk me through integrated versus non-integrated economics you know in terms of what we're seeing and how you see supply demand play off for styrene through the end of the decade? David Kinney : Nick, this is Dave. We haven't revealed really our co-producer economics. It's really tied up in the production of the propylene oxide as well. And so, we haven't broken that out \u2013 historic. Nicholas Cecero : Yeah. Thank you. Bob Patel : Alright. So, with that being the last question let me close with some remarks. So, first of all, you know there remains a potential for choppier U.S. polyethylene market later this year. We continue to believe that this cycle is short and shallow. Whatever takes place later in the year, think about operating rates. We're coming into this year with very, very high operating rates. If supply growth exceeds demand growth by a 1% or 2%, we're still left with very high operating rates. In terms of our own business, we expect I&D and Refining segment performance to offset declines in U.S. P profitability should they materialize later in the year. I think this is again, the strength and balance of the overall LyondellBasell portfolio. On the meantime, you know our focus continues to be on operational or commercial excellence and how we run the company day-to-day. And we're really starting to get traction now on our growth program as we advance polyethylene PO/TBA and move towards closing the Schulman deal so that we can integrate and create what we believe will be a world leader in terms of compounding. So, lot going on here and we'll forward to giving you an update at the next quarterly meeting. So, thank you for your interest and wish you all a great weekend. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. At this time you may disconnect your lines.",

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Johan. Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell's second quarter 2018 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer.

The passcode for both numbers is 3564. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : All right. Thanks, Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. By now I'm sure many of you have seen our earnings release that we put out this morning highlighting the specifics of the quarter. While I will go into greater depth on these results shortly, I want to take a brief moment to provide a longer view on why they are significant. Every year, over the past four years, our company has consistently generated more than $5 billion of cash from operating activities under a wide range of oil prices and industry conditions. During the second quarter of 2018, we generated $1.7 billion. In my view, these superior results are a product of our team's outstanding focus on efficiency, value creation, disciplined execution and our strong portfolio of businesses. This approach has not only delivered value, but also created the opportunity for us to develop and execute on a broader growth strategy that goes beyond brownfield expansions and is beginning to yield tangible results. Now, let's begin with slide 3 and review the highlights. During the second quarter, our focus on safe, reliable operations and diligent commercial efforts captured market opportunities, particularly within our Intermediate and Derivatives, Refining and Technology segments. Second quarter diluted earnings were $4.22 per share. Our second quarter results included a $346 million non-cash benefit from the settlement of a prior-year tax positions that increased earnings by $0.88 per share. Excluding this benefit and a one-time benefit from the U.S. tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017, our second quarter earnings per share represents a quarterly record that exceeds the previous record set in the first quarter of 2018. We also achieved quarterly EBITDA records for both our Intermediates and Derivative segment and our Technology segment. At our Annual General Meeting on June 1st, LyondellBasell shareholders approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to 10% of the company's shares over the next 18 months. In a few moments, Thomas will provide further detail on how our strong cash flows supported substantial shareholder returns with more than $700 million of dividends and share repurchases during the second quarter. We continue to advance our growth program during the second quarter, with significant progress on multiple initiatives. In June, we announced that LyondellBasell entered into exclusive discussions with Odebrecht regarding a potential transaction with Braskem. As you might expect, there is little to say at this point in the discussions. Our teams are working diligently to assess the feasibility and shareholder value of such a transaction. Our pending acquisition of A. Schulman moved forward with Schulman shareholders approving the transaction in June. Antitrust clearances have been obtained from the United States, the European Commission, China, Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and Russia, to name a few. Our team anticipates securing the remaining regulatory approval during the third quarter and is ready to begin the integration process. To this end, we announced last week that Jim Guilfoyle, who leads our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, will lead our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment following the close of the transaction. Until his replacement is named, Jim will continue to oversee our I&D segment. In June, we continue to expand our joint venture portfolio with the announcement of a new 400 kiloton per year of polypropylene plant in South Korea that will utilize LyondellBasell's industry-leading Spheripol technology to serve customers in Asia. Our organic growth programs are advancing well with significant construction activity in our Hyperzone polyethylene plant in La Porte, Texas. This is scheduled to start up in the middle of 2019. We also made very good progress in our PO/TBA project, as we work toward a 2021 start-up. Underlying all of our business results, there's one outcome that is perhaps the most important to us. On slide 4, I would like to take a moment to highlight the significant improvement in the safety performance achieved by our employees and contractors during the first half of 2018. In my view, this is an important indicator for our investors because of the close tie between safety and operational excellence. Although it's tempting to become complacent about safety after years of top decile performance, as a team, we rededicated ourselves to the goal of zero injuries and delivered a 38% improvement in workers safety during the first half of this year. We're extremely proud of this achievement and I want to thank all of our employees and contractors who've contributed such great performance. And now, Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the second quarter. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to slide 5, which shows our quarterly and trailing 12 months segments results. During the second quarter, robust demand for polyolefins supported chain margins for both of the regional Olefins and Polyolefins segment, especially in the United States. Strong operations and markets across nearly all product lines generated record quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, while continued strength in operational reliability and improving markets increased refining results. I also would like to highlight how increased licensing revenue drove a record quarterly EBITDA of $113 million for our Technology segment. Our Technology group has been increasingly successful at licensing both LyondellBasell's polyethylene and polypropylene process technology over the past year. With this strong quarter, LyondellBasell's trailing 12 months EBITDA has increased to approximately $7.5 billion. On slide 6, we describe our recent cash generation and deployment. As Bob mentioned, during the second quarter we generated over $1.7 billion of cash from operating activities and over $700 million was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases, as we repurchased more than 3 million shares. We increased our investment in capital expenditures to approximately $500 million during the quarter, primarily due to increased activity related to construction of the Hyperzone polyethylene plant. After this activity, our balance of cash and liquid investments grew by approximately $400 million during the second quarter. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.7 billion of cash from operating activities and used approximately 40% for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program and other financial activities, the cash and liquid investment balance increased over the past year by approximately $1.3 billion to end the quarter at nearly $3.9 billion. Slide 7 depicts some recent history of our cash generation and deployment. Operating activities at LyondellBasell have consistently generated between $5 billion and $6 billion of cash over the past several years. Our trailing 12 months free cash flow has increased to over $4 billion, with less capital investment during 2017 and stronger cash generation during 2018. Over the remainder of 2018, we expect to increase our capital investment for growth, as we complete the Hyperzone polyethylene plant and ramp up activity for construction of the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant. Our forecast for capital expenditure during 2018 remains at approximately $2.4 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion allocated to maintenance that supports our high operational reliability. The chart on the right illustrates returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The foundation of our capital deployment strategy is a leading, sustainable and progressively growing dividend. Our dividend yield of 3.6% remains in the top quartile of the S&P 500. LyondellBasell's substantial cash flow generation continues to provide capability for shareholder returns through share repurchases. As Bob mentioned earlier, our shareholders recently approved the new buyback program for as much as 10% of our shares over the next 18 months. Our tactics to optimize share repurchase may occasionally produce short-term reliability in the rate of our repurchase volumes such as that seen in the fourth quarter of 2017. But share buybacks continue to be a component of our capital deployment strategy. With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : All right. Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 8 and review our segment results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $700 million, an $80 million decline from the first quarter. Olefins results decreased by approximately $175 million compared to the first quarter of 2018. Ethylene margins declined by approximately $0.07 per pound and volume increased with improved derivative operating rates. Ethylene operating rates remained strong across our system during the second quarter, averaging 89% despite planned maintenance downtime at one of our Channelview, Texas crackers. Approximately 85% of our ethylene production was from ethane and an approximately 93% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results improved by approximately $105 million. Polyethylene spreads over ethylene increased by approximately $0.07 per pound, as ethylene prices declined while polyethylene prices were relatively unchanged. Planned maintenance on one of our two crackers at Channelview was completed during the second quarter. We estimate that the impact to second quarter results was approximately $50 million. We have no significant planned maintenance in this segment for the remainder of 2018. We continue to see weakness in spot ethylene prices during July, due to inconsistent and lower than anticipated operating rates on downstream derivatives. This is creating length (00:14:02) ethylene. Strong domestic and global demand for polyethylene is supporting firm polyethylene pricing and robust ethylene to polyethylene chain margins. Improving operating rates on these profitable downstream derivatives is expected to provide a more balanced ethylene market over the coming months. With the recent commissioning of another U.S. ethylene cracker, ethane feedstock prices have increased in a similar pattern seen during previous start-ups of crackers and ethane export terminals. Strong NGL production coupled with new pipeline and fractionation capacity is supporting the recent reversion to lower ethane prices, as new demand is addressed with plentiful ethane supplies. The highly anticipated wave of ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America is well underway. As seen on the upper right part of slide 9, the majority of the capacity planned for the period from 2016 to 2019 has started. Approximately 65% of both ethylene and polyethylene has entered the markets. In addition to polyethylene, ethylene consumption by other derivatives such as ethylene oxide and alpha olefins is also expanding. In general, much of the new ethylene capacity has ramped up smoothly, while some of the new and existing derivative units are struggling with operating issues that are temporarily limiting ethylene demand. So far, the new U.S. polyethylene capacity has been largely absorbed by this year's strong domestic U.S. demand with exports only recently increasing above historical norms. Over the coming months, North American polyethylene capacity additions will increasingly serve a relatively balanced global market and China's growing trade deficit for polyethylene. Turning to slide 10, let's review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, EBITDA was $447 million, $71 million lower than the first quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $15 million. Utilization of advantaged feedstock increased by 3%. Our crackers operated at 95% of their nameplate capacity during the second quarter, exceeding industry average performance by about 5%. Combined polyolefin results declined by approximately $40 million, primarily due to reduced margins for polyethylene. Joint venture equity income declined by approximately $20 million. During July, global markets remained tight to balanced with robust demand. Industry consultants indicate that three European crackers will undergo planned maintenance during the third quarter. This includes the larger of our two crackers in Wesseling, Germany, which will begin approximately two months of maintenance in the middle of September. We estimate the impact from this downtime will be approximately $55 million, with about $15 million impacting the third quarter and $40 million impacting the fourth quarter. On slide 11, we again highlight the record-setting quarter from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA increased to $642 million, exceeding the previous record established in the first quarter of 2018 by $156 million. Our assets ran well and allowed us to realize opportunities from tight markets. PO and derivatives performed similarly to the previous quarter, continuing to capture margin strength seen year-to-date. Strong volumes and higher margins across nearly every product drove approximately $110 million of improvement for intermediate chemicals. Oxyfuels and related products results improved by approximately $45 million due to increased margins and volumes associated with seasonal demand for oxyfuels. During July, oxyfuels margins moderated due to higher feedstock costs. Margins for styrene and methanol are also expected to moderate, as new methanol capacity enters the market and styrene markets become more balanced with reduced industry maintenance. We will be performing maintenance at one of our three propylene oxide plants in Bayport, Texas during the third and fourth quarter of this year. We expect the maintenance will reduce EBITDA by approximately $50 million, with about $20 million of that impact during the third quarter and $30 million in the fourth quarter. On slide 12, we describe the drivers behind the $450 million of improved performance by our I&D segment during the first half of 2018. Although much of this year's improvement is due to synchronized margin strength across multiple value chains in this segment, roughly 15% of this year's improvement can be attributed to sustainable contracting improvements and a return to our typical asset reliability. We've implemented new contracting strategies that improve our capture of market upside without significantly increasing downside exposure. Another 20% of this year's improvement can be attributed to PO and TBA volumes with less planned maintenance and a reduction in the precious metal catalyst costs incurred during the first half of 2017. The remaining 65% of this year's improvement is derived from capturing market opportunities afforded by strong supply and demand fundamentals. These are the times when LyondellBasell's commitment to safe and reliable operations generates exceptional returns. While not all of this upside is durable, we expect to see an upward trajectory for this segment relative to the annual profitability seen in 2016 and 2017, as we advance towards start-up of our next world-scale PO/TBA plant in 2021. Now, let's move to slide 13 for a discussion of our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $104 million, a $41 million improvement over the first quarter. The refinery continued operating at a strong rate of 259,000 barrels per day during the second quarter. The Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased over $5 per barrel when compared to the first quarter. Margin improvements were partially offset by other crude differentials and an increase in blending cost to meet summer gasoline specifications. The cost of RINs decreased relative to the first quarter. During July, our refinery has continued to operate near nameplate capacity, but refining margins are moderating with a declining Maya 2-1-1 crack spread. In the middle of September, we will begin planned maintenance on one of the two pairs of crude distillation and coking units at the refinery. This maintenance is expected to impact EBITDA by approximately $65 million, with $20 million of that impact in the third quarter and the balance in the fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 14 for an update on several significant milestones that were achieved in the A. Schulman acquisition during the second quarter. On June 14, A. Schulman shareholders approved the acquisition; and on June 27, we've received European antitrust clearance. In the coming weeks, we anticipate approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. We look forward to welcoming A. Schulman employees to our team and are really excited about the shareholder value that the combined business will create. We'll continue to update you on our progress as we expect to finalize the transaction during the third quarter of 2018. Slide 15 summarizes a few drivers that could fuel LyondellBasell's earnings growth over the next 12 months. The completion of the A. Schulman acquisition will improve our vertical integration and expand our reach into growing and attractive markets. Start-up of our Hyperzone polyethylene capacity in 2019 will meet a rising demand for high-density polyethylene and improve our capture of integrated ethylene/polyethylene chain margins. Our Intermediates and Derivatives team has diligently driven structural business improvements and is reaping the benefits from favorable market conditions. Our team at the refinery has delivered five consecutive quarters of highly reliable operations with improved margin. And going forward, our Houston refinery is well positioned to benefit from new regulations from marine fuels during the latter half of next year. Turning to slide 16, allow me to recap some highlights. Building on our strong track record of performance, our team delivered another quarter of superior results from our global portfolio of diverse petrochemical businesses. Record quarterly EBITDA results from Intermediates and Derivatives and Technology, along with solid improvements from Refining, more than offset the challenging conditions from rising olefin feedstocks and capacity additions in North America. Our robust cash flows continue to support both reinvestment in our growth programs and generate shareholder returns. We see continued strength in our business with strong global demand growth for our products in both consumer-based and industrial markets over the remainder of 2018. As new North American industry capacity is absorbed by the market, we anticipate decreasing impacts from short-term feedstock constraints and inventory imbalances across the value chain. With a solid pipeline of organic growth charted for the next decade and the potential for additional growth from M&A, our team is working diligently to advance our progress and maximize return to our shareholders. With that said, we're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Our first question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes, good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Bob, question on polyethylene inventory. Typically, converters destock or carry low inventories when they see new plants starting up. So can you talk about where do we stand on inventories in the U.S.? And actually a similar question for China, because with all the tariffs and ban on imported recycled plastic, what's going on there in terms of inventories? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. P.J., I've commented on this at the last earnings call and my view has not changed. I think converter inventories here in the U.S. are on the low end because of the expectation of new capacity coming, as you rightly mentioned, and I think that will continue here through the fall. So, I think any unplanned events will likely cause more tightness in the market. China inventories, a little bit less visibility in terms of what goes on there. But our sense is that demand is growing at very good rates. Per IHS, the forecast for demand growth for polyethylene is 8.5% for 2018, so a very strong rate, and I think that all points to a very good market in the back half of 2018. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: It is a sort of extension of that question, if you think about these tariffs and plastic bans and all that, would that mean the Chinese MTO plants will run at a higher rate to meet local demand? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : I think it's possible. First of all, I think we're \u2013 as I mentioned before, we believe that fair and free trade is certainly very important to have healthy markets and a healthy global economy. I think in the near term, demand is fairly fixed. It's a question of how that demand is met. And I think, one consequence of the tariffs could be, yes, that MTO plants run harder. The other is that maybe trade patterns will shift such that China's demand could be met more from the Middle East and perhaps more U.S. product flows to Europe and other places. We've seen a bit of that in styrene. As you know, there have been anti-dumping duties and tariffs that have been levied, but the market has kind of managed through that change very well. So I would expect that we'd see similar things in polyethylene. And I kind of step back from all the tariff noise and say that global operating rates are very high and demand is growing at very good rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good Morning. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Bob, obviously, strong results within I&D and particularly strong volume growth within the acetyl side of things. My question is that, one of your acetyl competitors recently gave their views about supply/demand fundamentals over the next two years. And they talked about global utilization rates tightening by 600 to 800 basis points between, call it, now and 2020. And two-thirds of that they attributed, so two-thirds of that tightening they attributed to just regular demand growth, but a third to Chinese environmental sort of related closures. So, do you \u2013 first of all, do you have a similar sort of supply/demand global utilization rate view? And the follow-up to that would be that, if this is impacting acetic in such a way or VAM in such a significant way, I'd imagine there are other sort of petrochemicals and chemicals which would be impacted as well. So are you \u2013 any sort of clarity around this and your thoughts would be appreciated. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes, Hassan. So on VAM, directionally I tend to agree that the outlook looks good. I think the magnitude, we'll have to see how that plays out. But the broader point you raised which I think is very important is that, the growing sort of regulation or a more tightening regulatory environment on chemical operations in China is important and meaningful, and I think will tend to favor our intermediate and chemicals business, whether it's EO or VAM or other products. So directionally, I think it's good for our I&D segment and constructive for the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Nice quarter, Bob. Bob, I know you can't discuss the Braskem acquisition. But in theory, what makes that asset attractive? I know you do like polypropylene, but maybe discuss maybe polypropylene or \u2013 overall what makes Braskem attractive to you and Lyondell? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Well, I've described in the past that from an industrial logic standpoint, there's sort of a consolidation play in the O&P space. It gives us a presence in Latin America that we don't have today, and we think that's a very important market as we look out long term in terms of the Olefins and Polyolefins space. They have very high-quality assets and it's a well-run company. So I think there are a lot of, I think, potential benefits to our shareholders. So, we'll just have to kind of work through our process and see where we come out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Hi, Kevin. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Bob, how would you compare and contrast the propylene monomer market these days in the United States versus Europe? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, there is a very important distinction in the U.S. is that the cracker fleet in the U.S. is much more flexible. So, that drives some of the variability in propylene supply. Generally speaking, I would say, propylene supply remains very tight in the U.S. and likely will continue to be so. And especially, as over the last decade you've seen more ethane cracking, that's reduced the amount of propylene output and incrementally some new derivatives have come to market. So, I would expect propylene to be more dynamic in terms of prices or continued sort of dynamic as it has been. In Europe, it's more of a stable market and tends to follow naphtha and tends to kind of follow overall cracker margins. It's not as dynamic in terms of price just because of the supply being more stable. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet : Good morning. Thank you. Just following up on VAM. Bob, is there any interest in perhaps adding to VAM capacity if there is enough return on capital in that area? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Good morning, Alex. I've been focusing the team on maximizing the potential of the asset we have on the ground today. And so, we're trying to find opportunities where we can increase output and increase efficiency at little or no cost. And I think we do have some opportunities in that area and I'd like to see us reap those benefits before we think about other assets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. Bob, you put in some data in one of these slides about domestic demand growth for polyethylene U.S. and Canada, almost 55% \u2013 sorry, 5% (00:33:12) year-over-year in the first half. Is that consistent with demand growth that either you've been expecting or that you're seeing from your customers? And if so, what's driving that level of demand growth? And are you having any increased dialogue with your customers on addressing some of the chatter that's out there on banning one-time use of plastic? Is that just noise out there or do you see any meaningful impact from it? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, on the growth rates, I think they're really reflecting a very strong U.S. GDP environment. And as you know, polyethylene growth tends to tie very closely to GDP growth. So I think it's \u2013 the growth rates are a reflection of a very good U.S. market and more penetration of plastics into other end users. So, I think that trend is very good and very durable. I've also pointed out in prior earnings calls that, typically our industry experiences most of our annual growth in the first three quarters of the year because of seasonality and the like. So, I think that also plays a role as it does in prior years. Now, let me answer your question on sort of plastics waste. First of all, there's been a lot of press about plastic waste in oceans and rivers and landfills and so on. I can tell you that our industry understands that this is a very, very important issue and something that we must be a part of the solution. It's a key focus area for trade associations around the world including American Chemistry Council and Cefic and others. And we hold membership \u2013 we have core (00:35:11) members in a lot of these associations and hold leadership positions on many of these. There is a lot of alignment globally in the industry that we've got to do substantial things to address this challenge of plastic waste. You should expect a pretty significant launch before year-end on an initiative around plastic waste. And I think that will clarify how serious the industry is about addressing this. But on sustainability, there is a positive side to it in terms of plastics. So first of all, plastics extend the life of food through packaging. And if you think about fuel efficiency in vehicles, it's made possible by light-weighting which comes from plastic. So there is a very positive aspect in terms of sustainability. The last thing I wanted to mention is, here at LyondellBasell we're doing a lot in this area. You heard me talk in the past about our Quality Circular Polymers joint venture. It's a one of a kind recycling joint venture with a waste management company called SUEZ in Europe. That's off to a really good start. And I'm convinced and I think it's a model for a platform we'll be able to replicate elsewhere in Europe. We also recently signed an agreement with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany to develop catalyst and process technology that decompose post-consumer plastic waste. So, there's a lot going on in this area. So look for big announcements from the industry by year-end as we get serious about tackling this issue of plastic waste. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just a question on your outlook, I guess, for both North America and ex-North America olefins. I guess, we've seen some softening in Asian prices. What do you expect for the rest of the year in North America? I mean, on the polyethylene side we've seen some price increases pushed out. You expect ultimately those would have support or not? And then, secondarily in Europe, it looks like sequentially we are going to be lower on the margin side in Q3, Q4. Just wanted to get your thoughts on those two dynamics. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So Arun, first of all, prices like any year tend to follow seasonal patterns. So we typically have a stronger spring and a strong fall sort of period. That seasonality is much stronger in Europe because of a more prevalent sort of summer holiday season or many factory shutdown \u2013 converter shutdown. Let me kind of step back and think about operating rates. So last year, globally we had very high operating rates, really near full capacity in ethylene and polyethylene. Now if you look at change in supply and change in demand from 2017 to 2018, supply growth is exceeding demand growth by forecast from IHS by less than 1% from 2017 to 2018. So given that we're starting at very high operating rates, coming off maybe 100 basis points on operating rates is frankly negligible in terms of impact on market. Prior cycles we've seen reduction of 10% in operating rates or greater. It's a very modest reduction. Furthermore, if you kind of peel that back and you look at high-density polyethylene which is kind of 70-or-so-percent of our output in polyethylene \u2013 actually, this year demand growth is forecasted to exceed supply growth by almost 150 basis points, and we're seeing that in the way kind of pricing is playing out. And if you look next year, overall polyethylene supply growth and demand growth will be very close to matched; and in HD, supply growth falls short again of demand growth projections. So who would have thought, Arun, that we would have had price rollovers when you've had this much new capacity comes on? And if by the end of the year operating rates have dropped 1% in my view, we still have a very tight market with not so much capacity coming in the next couple of years. I think it's important as we try to sort of sort through all of the noise from month-to-month, just step back and look at where operating rates are and we got a pretty tight market with normal seasonality. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. I was wondering, Bob, if you could discuss the differences in the European high-density polyethylene market year-over-year? That is, why was it such a better market in the second quarter of 2017 than it is in the second quarter of 2018? And likewise, for the polypropylene market year-over-year in Europe. And then, I have a question about how are cash taxes this year versus last year or the cash tax rate? Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Well, I'll take the first part of that and then ask Thomas to answer the second part of that. In terms of the European polyethylene and polypropylene business Q2 2017 compared to Q2 2018, if you go back to Q2 2017, last year was a very strong year in Europe, and I think many units in the industry or many plants were trying to ramp up and didn't run as well last year. We had a very, very tight market last year. This year I think you're seeing a more normal pattern where we see summer weakness in both polyethylene and polypropylene. I expect that with fall turnarounds planned and fall demand coming up, we'll see that come back into balance like we do in most years. And I would expect that the global sort of overlay of both polyethylene and polypropylene being strong will bear out in Europe as well. So, I just think Q2 2017 was unusually tight because of the big demand growth relatively speaking for Europe from 2016 to 2017 and then seasonality here in 2018. So, hope that answers your question, Jeff. And Thomas, on tax? Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay, Jeff. Thank you for the question. So with respect to the cash tax rate, so we ended 2017 with a cash tax rate of approximately 19% and we expect now the cash tax rate 2018, as we have communicated earlier, to be a little bit higher, somewhere between 22% and 24% for 2018. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just two questions, Bob. You talked a little bit about ethane and the price retreat recently in Mont Belvieu. So maybe just give us an update on your sort of $0.07 to $0.10 frac spread forecast. I think it's a bit higher than that now. And secondly, in Conway, a nice big discounts opened up again against (00:43:08) versus Mont Belvieu. So what's the durability of that? And then lastly, just as a clarifying question. In Tech, can you \u2013 is this the new run rate we should be thinking about from a quarterly perspective, or is any of that licensing revenue in the quarter just sort of a start-up one-time benefit? Thanks so much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Sure. So I'll take those one at a time. On ethane, first of all, I just want to provide some context on how these big tranches of ethane demand occur when new cracker start up. So a new cracker start-up, when it's world-scale cracker like 1.5 million tons, that's about 100,000 barrels a day of additional ethane demand when those start up. Now these are kind of big steps. It doesn't happen gradually. Now as you can imagine on the supply side, the supply then has to adjust and it takes a period of time, maybe a quarter or so, for the supply to adjust, to meet the demand of these big kind of jumps in demand. I've said in the past as you rightly mentioned that \u2013 I think $0.07 to $0.10 could be quite normal going forward. As you say, we're above that today. But on the other hand, with higher oil prices, the U.S. sort of advantage and the slope of the global cost curve is still quite good. And we also had in Q2 some issues on the Mariner East pipeline. So that impacted the source of exports of ethane and put more tightness on the Gulf Coast. I think all of this is going to kind of work its way through, as we get to a new normal. But again, when I step back and look at ethane fundamentals, there's a lot of ethane available on the Permian. New pipelines have been announced for Y-grade coming through the Gulf Coast. New fracs have been announced. There's one new frac that's about to start up. One other one recently started up. So kind of if each frac adds 60,000 barrels a day or so of ethane and more logistics are available to bring Y-grade from Permian, I think this will all kind of work its way through. But you have to appreciate that these jumps in demand are quite large for the size of the business that it is in the U.S. in terms of ethane. So, we may see some blips here in terms of ethane being above $0.10 frac spreads. But I think $0.10 is the reasonable thing to plan around longer term. Certainly, we're doing that. The Conway advantage and its durability, that ebbs and flows, it depends again on more about Gulf Coast; and up in Conway, very few consumers. I mean we represent a large part of the consumption of ethane up there. I continue to believe there will be a meaningful advantage in Conway and we should reap the benefits of that for years to come. On Technology, the run rate \u2013 first of all, when you think about our Technology business, there is kind of three components. There's our catalyst business which tends to be very steady. We have service income from licenses that we've issued over the years. That tends to be steady and modestly growing as we have more licenses. You can imagine as we have more units out there that are licensed, we're providing more service to those. What makes it more variable is the timing of license payments. And if you go back and look at the number of press releases we issued on new licenses last year, there was a meaningful step up from 2016. So we're seeing now the payments in 2017 of that of \u2013 sorry, in 2018 from the 2017 licenses that we signed. 2018 looks to be also a very active year. Again, you go back and you look at our press releases year-to-date, we're having a fairly active year. So, you know I'd caution you from taking Q2 as a run rate, but I would tell you that there's been a step up in activity in 2017 and 2018, and I expect that to continue. Our focus is in China, more polypropylene than polyethylene. So that's how I would kind of characterize our licensing activity. So hope I've answered the three questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Are you contemplating any major I&D investments besides propylene oxide, given the strong performance in the rest of the chemicals in that portfolio? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Good morning, John. That's a pretty big investment that we're undertaking. So, I'd like to see our team deliver that before we consider others. As you know, we have a joint venture in PO/SM in China and there is a potential to do more there. But in the U.S., I'd like to see us deliver on our PO/TBA project which is, by the way, the largest capital investment this company or its predecessors have undertaken. So, focus on execution is also really important. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. In the slides, you mentioned that not all PE units are currently operating at full operating rates. Can you talk generally kind of what's hampering them to come up to speed or to a full run rate, and generally how long that takes across the market? And also with your own Hyperzone HDPE project, how long you would expect that to come online? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So good morning, Dylan. Just sort of anecdotal frankly, but my sense is that operations continue to improve. And your question about how long does it take, I would expect from 30 to 90 days something like that, about a quarter, to get to the grade slate and work out the bugs of these. All of these units are redefining world scale. So, we shouldn't minimize the challenge in ramping up and getting to new world scale. I'd expect our Hyperzone is going to be very similar. We're also introducing a new technology here. So if it takes a little longer, it may not surprise me. But I don't think it's a quarter longer, it's maybe a month longer or something like that. But what makes I think polyethylene more complex is that you have multiple products and you have to go through a sort of, what we call, a product wheel as opposed to with ethylene it's one product, and you're just trying to get on spec and get to full rates which in its way is also difficult, but a different set of challenges compared to numerous products in polyethylene. Operator : Our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Morning, guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Congrats to Jim to his new job, and way to go out on a high note at I&D. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, we expect a lot of him when he gets to our Advanced Polyolefins Solutions (sic) [Advanced Polymer Solutions] (00:50:26). Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Big job ahead of him. But on that I&D, it seems a lot of the performance was \u2013 the volumes are really high. It seems that practically every unit was operating at max capacity. So, does it mean that maintenance was deferred for later \u2013 or not deferred perhaps, but at least lower maintenance than average? And so, what can we expect [Technical Difficulty] (00:50:55) forward sort of normalized volumes? And then if you don't mind a follow-up, based on the same question on the Technology segment, how much of that is sustainable? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So on the maintenance side on I&D, we just didn't have much planned maintenance. As I mentioned during my prepared comments, we will have planned maintenance at our Bayport PO plant \u2013 one of our Bayport PO plants in Q3 and Q4. Look, I think we ran well as we expect to run well. We had in the prior period some issues that were uncharacteristic. So, part of that is the step up in volume from our I&D business. So I think the unplanned part, this is more typical what we did in Q2. The planned is, we don't defer maintenance. We typically do it when we need to do it and in terms of our planned schedule, we'll stay on that cadence. In terms of the run rate and the change in the Technology business, we can't really quantify the change. But I would tell you that, again, compared to \u2013 when you look at 2016 to 2017, there was a step up in the amount of licenses that we announced. The 2017 licenses are coming through in the P&L in 2018. We have a similar pace in 2018 signings that will come through in 2019. But when you look quarter-to-quarter, it still can be lumpy because of the way the payments are done. But I encourage you to kind of think about annual time horizons when you look at our Technology segment and quarterly the payments can be lumpy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Bob. How are you? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Doing well. How are you? Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good. Thanks. Could you walk us through what you're seeing in the U.S. polypropylene market? On slide 8, you showed some margin expansion. I think there has been some outages. Where do we stand on inventories? Are the higher absolute prices having any impact on demand? And do you have any update on your potential U.S. PP/PDH project? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Sure. Well, the PP market continues to be very tight, and any small outages sort of make the tightness more acute. Inventories, my sense is, are average or below average. The industry is kind of working through the usual seasonal high period in PP. I'd expect that to continue until there is meaningful new capacity. Imports have increased because of just more demand in the U.S. that has to be met. And I suspect that whenever new units come on down the road then some of those imports will decline. In terms of our own project, we're still working through the details and sort of the engineering of that. I want to make sure my team provides a very good estimate on capital so that we can make a good decision and with an eye towards creating shareholder value. So, we're still working through it. I don't have anything definitive to report to you today, but we still see the project as being attractive. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob, for closing comments. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : All right. Well, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful questions, as usual. At LyondellBasell, we recognize that our core focus on operational excellence, cost management, disciplined capital deployment, provides advantages in our industry. We're capturing opportunities to add value by leveraging these advantages with highly targeted growth. I'm very proud of the record-setting results our team delivered this quarter, and I'm confident that our winning strategies will allow us to continue on this trajectory over the coming years. So, thank you very much for your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you on our third quarter results, as well as the progress on all of our growth initiatives during the next call. With that, we're adjourned. Have a great weekend. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

That being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : All right. Thank you, Dave. Good day to all of you for participating around the world and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide 3 and review the highlights. During the third quarter, our company overcame headwinds from rising feedstock costs, global trade rebalancing, and new industry capacity. We ran our assets well and improved on 2017 profitability in four of our six segments. Year-to-date, LyondellBasell's EBITDA is nearly $250 million higher than 2017. Third quarter diluted earnings were $2.85 per share. Our results include $53 million of pre-tax charges associated with the acquisition of A. Schulman on August 21. That reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. After adjusting for transaction and integration expenses from A. Schulman and gains from an asset sale in the third quarter of 2017, our quarterly results improved by $0.55 per share relative to the prior year. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's value-driven growth strategy achieved several milestones. We've formed the world's largest compounding company with the acquisition of A. Schulman. We launched the Advanced Polymer Solutions business segment to provide focus and visibility for this new global platform. And, in Houston, we began construction of the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant. We continue to evaluate a potential transaction with Braskem. At the same time, our strong cash flows enabled us to return over $700 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In short, the employees of LyondellBasell are delivering on our promise of value-driven growth through a balanced strategy of operational excellence, profitable organic expansions, accretive M&A, and generous shareholder returns. Please turn to slide 4 where we report our safety performance for the third quarter with combined A. Schulman results since August 21. The drive for excellence at LyondellBasell begins with a commitment to safety and environmental performance based on the idea that our assets, the communities in which we operate, and our more than 17,000 employees should all finish the day in the same or better condition than they were at the start of the day. Our first communications with the A. Schulman employees that joined LyondellBasell in August consistently emphasized the importance of safe, injury-free operations. As we complete the fourth quarter, our team has recommitted to ourselves, our colleagues, and our families to finish strong in 2018 with another record year of improved safety performance. On slide 5 we describe the businesses that form our new Advanced Polymer Solutions business segment. APS is more than just the former A. Schulman business. The segment also includes LyondellBasell's global polypropylene compounds business from our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment, to double the volume and add more than twice the EBITDA to the legacy Schulman business. We also moved nearly 1 billion pounds of premium Catalloy and polybutene-1 polymers from O&P EAI and O&P Americas to complete the new APS segment. Combined with the adjusted EBITDA of approximately $200 million reported by A. Schulman, these businesses generated approximately $640 million of EBITDA during 2017. Slide 6 provides a glimpse of how our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment extends LyondellBasell's reach into growing and attractive markets. We have grouped the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment into two business lines. The Compounding & Solutions business combines LyondellBasell's existing polypropylene compounding business, which is largely focused on automotive applications, with A. Schulman's more diverse business lines. Masterbatches, our compounds that provide differentiated properties when combined with commodity plastics used in packaging, agriculture, and durable goods applications. Engineered composites and engineered polymers add value for more specialized high-performance applications across a variety of industries. Specialty powders are largely used to mold toys, industrial tanks, and sporting goods such as kayaks. Performance colors provide powdered, pelletized and liquid color concentrates for the plastics industry. The Advanced Polymers business of APS consists of LyondellBasell's legacy Catalloy and polybutene-1 polymer product lines. These unique polymers can be used within APS for downstream compounding or can be sold as raw materials to third-party customers. Catalloy is a line of differentiated propylene-based polymers that add value in packaging applications and construction materials such as the white membranes that are capturing an increasing share of the commercial roofing market. Polybutene-1 is a unique polymer that is used in both specialty piping and packaging applications. The Advanced Polymer Solutions segment provides both focus and visibility for LyondellBasell's new platform of profitable growth. And now Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the second quarter. Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to slide 7 which illustrates the developments of our business segments over the trailing 12 months. As Bob mentioned, four of our six segments have delivered increased profitability over 2017. Improved performance, particularly from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, more than offset compressed margins in O&P Europe, Asia, and International. During the third quarter, we were pleased to see continued strength in ethylene and polyethylene chain margins in North America where robust demand offset headwinds from higher ethane costs to support quarter-over-quarter earnings growth for our Olefins and Polyolefins America segment. Our refinery ran well during the third quarter. In the coming days, we will complete our last major planned maintenance event in advance of 2019 when increased demand of low-sulfur marine fuels specified by the International Maritime Organization is predicted to bolster margins for LyondellBasell's refinery. We were pleased to see that last week's IMO meetings in London reaffirmed the implementation plans for these new standards to reduce ship emissions. LyondellBasell's Technology business delivered another quarter of outstanding results, driven by increased licensing revenue. In the first nine months of 2018, LyondellBasell announced new license agreements for nine polyethylene and polypropylene plants around the world. During October, we announced another seven new plant licenses, bringing the year-to-date total to 16 new license agreements, the most ever in company history. The net result is that LyondellBasell's trailing 12 months' EBITDA is now approximately $7.4 billion, more than $550 million higher than the same period last year. As Bob mentioned, earnings grew by $0.55 per share relative to the same quarter last year. While nearly one-fourth of this improvement is due to higher earnings, nearly 70% of this earnings growth can be attributed to the reduction in our effective tax rate due to U.S. tax reform and other tax planning that decreased our rate by 9.2 percentage points to 17.2% in the third quarter. After excluding our beneficial second quarter tax settlements, we expect the full year effective tax rate to be somewhat lower than our initial guidance of 21%. On slide 8, you can see that LyondellBasell's businesses continued to generate over $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities during the third quarter. Approximately $1.8 billion of cash was invested in August to acquire A. Schulman and, during September, we called $375 million of A. Schulman debt. Our strong balance sheet enabled us to continue investing in our organic growth projects while returning over $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The quarter closed with over $2 billion of cash and liquid investments on the balance sheet. With approximately $3.3 billion of unused and available credit facilities, we closed the quarter with a total liquidity in excess of $5 billion. Now please turn to slide 9. The chart on the left illustrates our cash flow performance over the trailing 12 months. Over this period, LyondellBasell generated nearly $5.7 billion of cash from operating activities. This powerful cash generation has enabled our free cash flow to rise at the same time that our capital investments are also increasing. LyondellBasell's trailing 12 months' free cash flow yield was 9.7% at the end of the third quarter. Capital expenditures during the third quarter were approximately $480 million. Investments should increase during the fourth quarter as we continue the construction of our Hyperzone PE facility and accelerate the activity for building our PO/TBA plant in Houston. Our 3.9% dividend yield remains in the top quartile of all S&P 500 companies. Similar to the second quarter, we repurchased more than 3 million shares during the third quarter and finished September with 387 million shares outstanding. With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 10 and review our segment results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment third quarter EBITDA was $704 million, a $33 million increase over the second quarter. Olefins results improved by approximately $120 million compared to the second quarter of 2018 with the price of ethylene increasing approximately $0.04 per pound. Ethylene operating rates increased during the third quarter, averaging 93%. With the completion of planned maintenance at one of our four \u2013 one of our Channelview, Texas crackers in the second quarter, we were able to partially offset the impact of increased feedstock costs in the third quarter with propylene production from our flex unit. Approximately 81% of our ethylene production was from ethane and 93% came from NGLs. Polyethylene results decreased approximately $80 million during the third quarter, partially offsetting the improvement in olefins. Polyethylene spreads over ethylene decreased by approximately $0.06 per pound as the increase in ethylene price was coupled with the decline in polyethylene prices. Polyethylene chain margins are stable in October as an increase in polyethylene price was offset by higher ethane costs. We may see some margin recovery with the higher polyethylene prices in the fourth quarter and the recent moderation in ethane. Please turn to slide 11 to review the fundamentals behind the current ethane volatility. While most observers agree that ethane will be abundant in the long term, supply constraints in the recent weeks have caused prices to escalate from below $0.30 per gallon to over $0.60 per gallon. This past week, we've seen prices moderate to the low $0.30 per gallon range. This volatility is driven by an increase in ethane demand from new crackers and exports combined with constraints in midstream pipeline and fractionation capacity. The chart on the right illustrates our view of the U.S. Gulf Coast ethane situation. The bars represent ethane demand from both Gulf Coast ethylene crackers and exports. Many of the older ethylene crackers have the capability to optimize by switching feedstocks as market conditions change. For the years 2018 and beyond, we show this range of feedstock flexibility and the resulting impact to ethane demand. As you can see, supply and demand balances can quickly change by switching feedstocks in response to input prices, and reduced demand from ethylene crackers is rapidly reflected in lower prices for ethane. Today, many crackers continue to maximize ethane feed but we will likely see increased utilization of feedstock flexibility as the industry navigates through this period of volatility. We believe our view of port purity (00:16:07) ethane supply, represented by the blue line, is conservative and only considers fractionation projects that are underway. In addition to these projects, there is potential for new pipelines, expansions, or additional fractionation capacity that can further improve the ethane balances. Beyond new midstream investments and the increased utilization of alternative feedstocks, any increase in cracker maintenance downtime and the moderation of ethylene capacity additions will provide further relief over the coming quarters. Most supply-and-demand forecasts indicate that the current tightness in ethane should resolve by 2020. In summary, we believe this volatility is temporary and a result of misaligned investment cycles in the petrochemical and midstream industries. The strong underlying fundamentals are supportive, and there is attractive earnings growth potential as ethane supply improves while demand growth moderates. On slide 12, I would like to size the potential impact of higher ethane prices and highlight how LyondellBasell's feedstock flexibility and diverse business portfolio can reduce this impact. LyondellBasell's fleet of U.S. Gulf Coast crackers have very high feedstock flexibility. The chart on the right shows you the range of feedstocks where we can operate. As you can see, we are able to use as little as 25% ethane and as much as 65% naphtha in our feed. Our olefins optimization team is continuously seeking to maximize profitability across our crackers through optimization of feeds and products. We can rebalance NGL feeds within hours and switch to liquids within days to respond to changing economic conditions. Additionally, our two Midwest crackers have access to low-priced Conway ethane/propane mixed feeds. During October, ethane supply to our Midwest crackers was priced at approximately $0.13 per gallon. These crackers are not subject to the higher Gulf Coast ethane prices and continue to benefit from very strong chain margins. If you consider our last 12 months' U.S. ethylene production and subtract our low-cost Midwest volumes and Gulf Coast merchant ethylene sales that pass through the ethane increase costs, you're left with about 5.5 billion pounds of annual ethylene volume that could be impacted by higher ethane prices. For this volume, a $0.20 per gallon change in ethane price will impact annual earnings by about $380 million. This estimate assumes we continue to crack around 80% ethane and does not take into account benefits from feedstock flexibility. Furthermore, we are assuming in this analysis that prices for ethylene derivative products such as polyethylene, styrene, ethylene oxide, and VAM do not change. A price increase of $0.03 per pound for both polyethylene and styrene could reduce the impact by $290 million. This is another example of how LyondellBasell's diverse portfolio of businesses and assets helps to stabilize earnings during challenging market conditions and produce the resilient results that we delivered during the third quarter . Now please turn to slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $262 million, $93 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $55 million. Volume decreased primarily due to planned maintenance which began in September at our cracker in Wesseling, Germany, impacting the quarter by approximately $15 million. This maintenance will be completed in the fourth quarter and is expected to impact results by $25 million in Q4. Olefin margins also declined in third quarter as increases in feedstock costs outpaced an increase in the olefin prices. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $45 million. Polyolefin demand followed typical seasonal declines during the third quarter and polypropylene margins have decreased following increases in the price of propylene. Joint venture equity income increased by $15 million. The chart on the lower left indicates that European polyethylene chain margins in the third quarter of 2018 were approximately $0.21 per pound, a similar level to the average seen five years ago in the region for the full year 2013. European polypropylene margins have also declined, reaching approximately $0.02 per pound in the third quarter of 2018. Minimal industry investment has resulted in a slight improvement in polypropylene margins compared to the average for 2013. Annualizing the third quarter 2018 profitability from our O&P EAI segment produces a much higher result than what we realized in 2013. After adjusting for historical profitability from businesses that were moved to our new APS segment, O&P EAI is now generating EBITDA at an annual rate that is more than $500 million higher than five years ago. Our restructuring efforts for the segment in the early years of this decade and an improved market for polypropylene are producing sustainable earnings improvements for LyondellBasell. During October, European markets for polymers remained pressured with sluggish demand growth and ample supply. Market pressure is expected to continue during the fourth quarter with typically lower seasonal demand. Low water levels on the Rhine are also causing disruptions for petrochemical transportation and production in Germany that could counter these trends and lead to tighter market conditions. On slide 14, let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $504 million, a reduction of $138 million from the prior quarter. While the high number of red arrows in the chart on the upper right clearly indicates a decline, you might recall that we are following a record-setting second quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the margins and business performance of the segment. Planned maintenance on one of our propylene oxide plants in Bayport, Texas impacted third quarter results by approximately $20 million. This maintenance will be completed in November and is expected to impact fourth quarter results by approximately $25 million. PO and derivatives results declined approximately $50 million. Volumes were lower due to planned and unplanned downtime, and we also experienced a seasonal decline in markets. Intermediate chemicals results fell by approximately $35 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to a $0.04 per pound decrease in styrene margins. Lower seasonal margins in the third quarter drove a decline in oxyfuels and related products of $55 million. During October, oxyfuels margins declined with weaker gasoline demand. Margins for styrene and methanol are also expected to moderate as new methanol capacity fully enters the market and styrene capacity returns following industry maintenance downtime. Turning to slide 15, let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. As I mentioned, we completed the acquisition of A. Schulman on August 21, and the results from the new product lines are included from that point forward. Thus, comparisons of underlying business drivers for the second quarter are related to the LyondellBasell legacy product lines of polypropylene compounds, Catalloy, and polybutene-1. EBITDA decreased by $51 million compared to the second quarter. Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition were approximately $49 million during the third quarter of 2018. Results for both Compounding & Solutions and advanced polymers were relatively unchanged versus the second quarter. The addition of new product lines from the acquisition offset seasonal volume and margin declines for polypropylene compounds. Our integration of A. Schulman is going very well. Of the $49 million of costs assigned to the segment during the quarter, approximately 60% were related to the integration and 40% to the transaction. As of the end of the third quarter, we have focused on reducing redundancies to capture cost synergies at an annual rate of $32 million. We are well on track to reach our target of $150 million in cost-based synergies within two years. The chart on the lower right provides a good example of one of the attractive and growing markets found in our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. As I mentioned earlier, Catalloy is a line of differentiated propylene-based polymers that can be used in packaging, compounding or in construction materials such as the white commercial roofing membranes that we see in a photograph on slide 6. Polyolefin roofing membranes are becoming the preferred solution for commercial roofing and growing at an annual rate of 7% per year due to their durability, cost savings and energy efficiency. The unique and desirable properties of LyondellBasell's Catalloy polymers provides an advantage for commercial roofing applications, and our sales volumes in this market have outpaced the industry and have grown by 9% over recent years. We look forward to sharing more examples of the products and customer solutions that are driving growth for our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment in future calls. Now let's move to slide 16 for a discussion of our Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $84 million, a $20 million decline from the second quarter. Crude throughput at the refinery averaged 232,000 barrels per day with planned maintenance beginning in September that impacted EBITDA approximately $20 million. This maintenance will be completed in November and is expected to impact fourth quarter results by $45 million. While the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread decreased by more than $4 per barrel when compared to the second quarter, our refinery benefited from margin improvements driven by favorable Canadian crude oil prices relative to the Maya price. During October, we continued the safe execution of our planned maintenance at the refinery. Margins are moderating with a declining Maya 2-1-1 crack spread driven by lengthened gasoline inventories as the summer driving season ends. On slide 17, I would like to review the drivers that could fuel LyondellBasell's earnings growth over the next 12 months. These are no longer distant promises. These are opportunities that we focused on during the third quarter and will continue to advance during the coming months. The completion of the A. Schulman acquisition is improving our vertical integration and expanding our reach into growing and attractive markets. Our integration management office is rapidly driving integration and capturing synergies. The startup of our Hyperzone polyethylene capacity in 2019 will meet the rising demand and favorable markets for high-density polyethylene to improve our capture of integrated chain margins. Our Intermediates and Derivatives team have diligently driven structural improvements within their business which continues to benefit from favorable market conditions. Our team at the Houston refinery has delivered six consecutive quarters of highly reliable operations with improved margins. And going forward, our refinery is well positioned to benefit from new regulations for marine fuels during the latter half of next year. Turning to slide 18, let me summarize this quarter's highlights. During the third quarter, our company delivered year-over-year and year-to-date EBITDA improvements in four of our business segments. We overcame the challenges of new industry capacity and rising feedstock costs, increased third quarter profitability for our O&P Americas segment. Over the past 12 months, our company generated approximately $5.7 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed to funding for our increased capital investment, paying a top-quartile dividend, completing over $800 million in share repurchases, and completing the acquisition of A. Schulman. We have built the world's largest plastics compounding business. We're progressing on integration that will capture significant synergies in this new segment. We have advanced on the construction of our new polyethylene and PO/TBA capacity, and we're continuing to evaluate the Braskem opportunity. Our global portfolio of businesses provides confidence in our ability to remain resilient, flexible and advantaged in this environment. Going forward, we look forward to the safe and timely completion of our fourth quarter planned maintenance that will allow us to capture this advantage during 2019 and beyond. With that said, we're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. The first question is from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Bob, the ethane flexibility slide you showed is quite interesting. And you mentioned you've got pretty quick ability to switch. So I'm curious, in light of when ethane got up to $0.60, can you give us your spread across those different input molecules, what you used, ethane, the propane, butanes and the naphtha? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we can change very quickly. And in some cases, we were able to switch to liquids very quickly. Channelview and Corpus Christi are our most flexible crackers and that's where we tend to focus on pushing more on liquids. So, I don't have the exact numbers with me at that point in time what we did, but we did start to move where we could quickly. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And did you adjust at all? I noticed in your interesting slide about the industry flexibility, you referred back to 10 years ago. It seemed like there's been a wave of conversions or upgrading to ethane feedstock ability. Are you pretty confident that most of those \u2013 and I guess speaking from your own assets that you can go back to where you were 10 years ago in terms of liquids processing capability? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. In our case, certainly we've accounted for our ability to process the co-products from heavier feeds and we've retained all that capability, again, primarily at Channelview, and we did our best estimate of the rest of the industry and took into account what capacity was converted versus which part of the capacity was made more flexible (00:32:44). Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Right. Thanks for the help. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. Bob, I was wondering if you have the ability to crack Y-grade. If there's a surplus of it with not enough fractionation capacity, can you crack Y-grade or do you have downstream limitations on recovering that methane? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. So, Steve, we do have capability of cracking Y-grade and, in fact, we're working on increasing that capability, and we're able to make some relatively low-cost investments and increase our flexibility to crack Y-grade and we're working on that right now. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Interesting. And then a quick one on all the media attention on recycled plastic and so forth. Do you see that as just kind of peripheral noise or are you hearing it from your plastics customers where they have a meaningful interest in increasing the blend of recycled plastic into their product that could create a pull? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I think, Steve, the area of plastic waste and sustainability is continuing to get more interest and rightfully so. But I think it'll take time for the infrastructure to develop and the capability to develop to increase recycling. As you know, we have a joint venture with SUEZ in the Netherlands, what we call QCP, and that's very much that. It's a platform that eventually we will grow to have more recycled content. But if you step back and think about plastics demand growth, demand growth for plastics is still growing at a multiple of GDP. So to the extent that there's more recycled content, I still think the growth story is in place for plastics. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Ethane has come down quite a lot, Bob, recently. Do you think that that has to do with different crackers being turned around or do you think that the industry is already switching over to other feedstocks and so, what that did is it lessened demand for ethane and brought the price down? How do you diagnose the price change? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Slide 11 in our presentation really shows how balanced the market is on ethane. And when we reach this sort of balance between supply and demand, small shifts in supply or demand tend to make the price dynamic. And I think what's happened in the recent weeks is that there's been some planned maintenance on some fairly large ethane crackers. There's also been some switching to other feedstocks. So, I expect that for the next few quarters we're going to see this sort of dynamic pricing on ethane. When some of these crackers return, you could see ethane price rise again. And that's why we wanted to size the impact to LyondellBasell on a large change in ethane if it were to be sustained an entire year. And what you see is, given our portfolio of crackers and given our two Midwest crackers, the impact to us is not as great as one might think before flexibility-based mitigation. So, if we just continued to crack a lot of ethane \u2013 we've sized the impact on page 12, if we flex to other feeds, then the impact would be less. So, I think we're going to see ebbs and flows through next year. We'll have turnaround season again in the spring. So, likely, that will reduce ethane demand. And in the meantime, more fractionation capacity is coming in 2019. More pipeline capacity is being built. So, we're going to go through a period of sort of timing of when feedstock is built out and when new consumptive capacity comes on. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, given that there seems to be some switching to probably naphtha, when you think about propylene values for next year, do you think propylene will be a little bit looser in 2019 than it was in 2018 given feedstock switches and other considerations? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Possibly. But it will be episodic I think, right, because as feed slates change, it won't be consistently well supplied. So I think ultimately, Jeff, what changes the propylene situation is as new PDHs are built, those are sort of structural increases in supply. And to your point about naphtha, there's actually also switching to propane and butane. And there are more LPGs coming from West Texas down the Y-grade lines. So, there's a lot of propane and butane on the Gulf Coast. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Good. Thank you so much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. You may go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Fermium Research LLC : Thank you, and good morning, gentlemen. Bob, I'm guessing a little less stressful this third quarter than where we were a year ago with Harvey. I wanted to ask about Braskem. When do you think you're going to have a decision there? And obviously I'm wondering if that might also play a role in your pace of buybacks here in Q4 with the market turmoil. Can you add a little color as to what investors might be able to expect in terms of M&A versus buyback and kind of the timing on that? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, Frank, we're continuing to work diligently and thoughtfully through our analysis around the Braskem transaction. There's really no timing to report at this point. We're continuing our work and thinking around shareholder value creation. And so, as we consider buybacks, to me, those are sort of independent decisions today. And whatever it is we decide in terms of our allocation of capital, we're aiming to create shareholder value. So stay tuned. Frank J. Mitsch - Fermium Research LLC : All right. Great. So, the decisions are kind of independent at this point. Fair enough. And then, I was struck by the title and the discussion on slide 17, Tangible Earnings Growth Over the Next 12 Months. Obviously, there's some debate out there as to what happens on margins on the olefin/polyolefin side of things. Should we be interpreting that statement to say that you're anticipating EBITDA over the next 12 months to be higher than EBITDA over the previous 12 months? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, what we're trying to indicate there is just sources of earnings growth. We haven't netted against polyolefins' market conditions. But I think, clearly, our I&D business has had a step up in earnings this year. We, at the last earnings call, talked about a 15% or so increase that's sort of structural in our business in I&D compared to our prior run rate. Refinery is running better. We think second half of next year, there will be some fuel switching as IMO starts to take hold and people get ready for March of 2020. And our new polyethylene plant in the second half of next year will consume ethylene today that essentially is selling near its cost. So, those are three, we think, meaningful sources of earnings growth next year. Frank J. Mitsch - Fermium Research LLC : All right. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Alex Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bob, European polypropylene margins declined meaningfully this year. And in the U.S., polypropylene margins held up pretty well. What in your view explains this difference and where do these regions are likely to converge? Is Europe likely to improve or U.S. decline? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I think, Alex, globally, polypropylene is still very constructive. Operating rates are still relatively high. I think, in Europe, as we've had in years past, typically in the summer season, we see seasonality because the vacation periods are longer and often converters shut down for periods of time. Demand growth is a little bit slower this year in Europe. So, we think that partly also contributes. But if I step back and look at the global situation in polypropylene, I think polypropylene still looks to us to be a very balanced tight (00:42:11) for the coming year or so. And so we would expect that polypropylene should hold up pretty well. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet : Thank you. And as a follow-up on polypropylene, you've indicated that you're looking at some polypropylene capacity projects in the U.S. and Europe and also PDH. Have you moved the likelihood of those projects higher or lower over the last six to nine months or so? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : We're still working through our early engineering estimates. Frankly, we're thinking through \u2013 on the Gulf Coast locations which location would be better given propylene supply, and we've had a few other things going on in the company. So, we're still working through it, and we think that propylene is an area where we'd like to continue to invest. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. You may go ahead. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: With ban on single-use plastic bags in many large cities around the world, do you see that end market for polyethylene coming under pressure? In other words, historically, people have assumed a GDP multiplier of 1.3 times or 1.4 times on polyethylene. Do you think that comes under pressure in the future? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, P.J., it's not a large part of the overall polyethylene market. And so, segment by segment there are different drivers but if I kind of step back and think about polyethylene demand growth, it's more about food packaging, polyethylene pipe, and some other sort of durable goods where I think polyethylene demand will continue to be driven. With respect to the single-use bags, some parts of the world have mandated thicker bags that can be reused. So, ironically, if that were the case, then more polyethylene would be consumed because the bags are thicker. And I can tell you, when I lived in the Netherlands, we used to buy those thicker bags and reuse them. So, I don't know that demand really sort of goes away for those bags. It just converts to other forms of packaging. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. And secondly, what are your views on the second wave of these ethylene crackers in the U.S. in light of this volatility in ethane? Do these companies say that this ethane situation would be resolved by the time these crackers come online, so they'll continue to build or do you think they start to get pushed out because of the situation? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, it's difficult for me to predict what others may do, but certainly, for us, we think through long-term supply and essentially the returns that we can earn on new investment \u2013 and we want to see more of the fractionation capacity and more pipeline capacity investments actually come to fruition before we would consider further ethylene investment in the U.S. Now, we're a bit uniquely placed because we've already invested in ethylene earlier in the decade. And our focus for the coming three, four years is really about now investing in derivatives to consume the ethylene that we've already expanded. So I would imagine that this volatility and impact on the global cost curve should be a part of the equation as new investments are contemplated. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Just on U.S. polyethylene, we saw a surprising price decrease in August and then we had the ethane spike in September and then got the price back. And now there are, I believe, nominations for both October, which is almost over, and November. So, could you just sort of reconcile what's going on in the U.S. market with that surprise decrease and now the increases and maybe contrast it to some of the weakness we're seeing in the Asian PE markets? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Well, I mean, it's difficult to predict here how prices will evolve. But the increases and decreases, Vincent, to me say that the market is relatively balanced. And in the face of a significant cost push, there was some increase that went through in the market. And I suspect that as we look at operating rates globally, not a lot will change. Even though there's new capacity coming, demand is growing as well. And we've gone through this in prior earnings call slides where we've shown operating rates are still 90-plus percent. And so, I suspect that prices will be dynamic based on how costs develop as well. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And maybe just on that, this whole ethane thing seemed to come \u2013 we all seemed to get blindsided by it, analysts and producers alike. As you guys did your sort of look-back on what's happened over the past three months, what do you think the blind spot was for everyone that we didn't see that big spike coming? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. That's a great question, Vincent. I think that the thing that many of us missed was the fact that ethane was being rejected in the Permian in favor of more propane and butane moving on the Y-grade capacity, the line capacity that's already there. In the past, we were of the mind that the Y-grade that comes from West Texas is very rich in ethane and it's been wetter and wetter as time has gone on. But when that ethane got rejected, the composition of the Y-grade that came to Belvieu had less ethane. And I think that's what we didn't see. And you can imagine from a midstream gas processor perspective, by rejecting some ethane, they can actually move more Y-grade in total out of the gas pool. So, I think that's the part we probably missed. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Bhavesh Lodaya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So, one more on the ethane and on the U.S. ethane advantage as such which we have enjoyed for quite many years for now. So, while you may see flex economics come into play, it's also more likely that that comes into play when ethane rises significantly from here. So, are we going to enter a period where the entire NGL barrel kind of like raises in value? And what does that do for the U.S. ethane advantage as you look forward the next few years? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. I think it's really \u2013 the ethane advantage still looks very durable to us because it's based on a view that there's an abundance of ethane supply. So, what we're seeing today is just a little bit of mismatch in timing of new cracker capacity for ethane consumption and new fractionation and pipeline that brings ethane to market. So, we view this very much as temporary and we think that the U.S. will continue to enjoy some advantage over the long term. The thing that certainly our company is watching is the degree of that advantage and how that might result in investment returns for new capacity. So, in the early days, in our company, we made a conscious choice to not convert to ethane cracking. We retained our flexibility, and we concentrated it around a couple of our crackers, and I think that will serve us well as we manage through a dynamic market environment like we have today. Bhavesh Lodaya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then one on the Technology segment. Some impressive wins with new licenses there and we're also seeing a very strong first nine months compared to the previous year. Can you share what the breakup is between the catalysts and the licensing revenues, and how sticky are some of these earnings? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, first of all, as we license technology, the catalyst sales go with it. So, the catalyst revenue and earnings tends to be more consistent and growing. The licensing can be cyclical based on investment cycles. But at the moment, we're seeing quite a bit of interest in our technology especially in Asia. And there's been some shift in the licensing landscape for polyolefins as well, which has worked to our benefit. And ultimately, I think the investment that's occurring around the world speaks to the confidence in plastic's demand growth at greater than GDP levels. So, we're quite optimistic about our technology segment and we continue to invest in new catalyst capacity. As we sell new licenses, we anticipate that we'll be selling more catalyst over time as well. Bhavesh Lodaya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. You may go ahead. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Bob, as you survey your portfolio, are you witnessing a normal demand pattern from a seasonal perspective across your major product lines in October and to the extent you have visibility into November or are there areas either by product line or geography where destocking is more pronounced than you would normally expect from a seasonal point of view? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Kevin, good morning. We see very typical demand here in the fall. Europe is slightly weaker I would say but otherwise, the rest of the world, we see demand being quite good and we're running our assets extremely hard around the world. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just to follow up on the technology licensing activity, obviously impressive results there. Do you think that you can go higher in 2019 from an investment cycle perspective in polypropylene plants, for example, or not? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No. I mean, the rate at which we're doing licenses today is quite high. So, just to sustain these rates gives us great earnings potential as we go forward. Again, typically, we see the catalyst income from a license four, five years later, and when we do these \u2013 when we sign these licenses, there are progress payments that occur over three, four years. So, there's kind of a \u2013 there's a tail of earnings that come. And so, there's been a meaningful step up here, and I think we can certainly continue this level for next year. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Understood. Thanks very much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Bob, just on ethane in 2019, how are you thinking about prices both on an absolute level as well as a relative level relative to its fuel value? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Well, David, I've been saying for quite a long time that ethane is going to trade over time $0.07 to $0.10 over its fuel value. Given that supply and demand are much more balanced today on ethane than they have been in the past few years, we could see that price over fuel value increase. I do think that it's going to be \u2013 it's going to move around depending on turnaround season. So, in the spring when there are turnarounds and there's less ethane consumption, then prices could moderate. New fractionation capacity is coming. I think it's estimated to be online sometime around the middle of next year. And new Y-grade pipeline. So, it'll be dynamic. But I think given that our overall thesis is there's lots of propane, there's a lot of butane, and if some of the ethane that's being rejected today in the Permian, if it ends up coming back into the pipe and coming down to Belvieu, then we just need 50,000, 100,000 barrels a day more of ethane to change the supply/demand balance. And so, I think it will be dynamic. And companies like us, we just need to make sure that we're looking at economics weekly as we do and shift our feed slate to maximize profitability. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And just on Braskem, how do the recent Brazilian election results impact or affect your thinking on Braskem? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I read everything that you read about the new president. And so, I mean, for now, we're very much focused on the fundamentals and value creation potential. And so, as I said earlier, we're working through the analysis and thinking through the value proposition. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. You may go ahead. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, fellas. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Question, just you had mentioned that spot ethylene is close to cash breakeven. With Indorama about to start up a cracker where they'll back out some spot purchases that they've done historically, do you think you'll be able to continue to run full out or will you actually have to run at lower operating rates, do you think, until you get your polyolefins absorption online later next year? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah, Duffy, I expect that we'll continue to run pretty full. I don't expect us to slow down on ethylene. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just one more on Braskem. For the majority of the dance, at least that we've been privy to kind of know about with Braskem, your stock price was circa $110 a share. Now that it's $90, does that change the way you look at Braskem or your share value is disconnected in your mind from the value of Braskem? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, look, I mean, again, it's really about long-term value creation in a transaction like this. And so, we're firmly focused on \u2013 just like we did with Schulman, thinking through how we can create value with something like this. So, our \u2013 it hasn't changed and as you can see, as evidenced by the third quarter, we've had still significant amount of share buyback. So, nothing has really changed in my mind. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, guys. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. You may go ahead. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. Can you talk about the Rhine River impacts? You said that this could tighten up some product chains for you. What about your ability to either obtain raw materials or ship products or supply raw materials to property tenants in Wesseling and things like that? Do you see any downside risks? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yes, Jim. So, our European team is hard at work in managing through the low Rhine levels, and we do see some very modest downtime and then downside risk in our EAI segment as a result of the low Rhine levels. So, just on an output basis, not considering any increase in product prices, we could see in Q4 $30 million to $40 million of impact across the quarter if this situation continues and we don't get rain over there. So, it's pretty modest, and we've had one of our crackers down for turnaround, so that actually reduces the impact. Our larger cracker at Wesseling is down for turnaround and will be coming up in November. So, as we bring that up, really, our consideration will be do we bring it up to full rates or do we bring it up to a little bit lower than full range. So, that maybe helps you size the Rhine River impact. It's quite modest. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Terrific. And on IMO 2020, are you confident that the EPA will not be able to delay this process or reduce enforcement of the standard? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, it's difficult to predict what regulatory agencies may do, but it seems to me that there's a lot of momentum around the world around this change in regulation. And many ship owners have acknowledged that this will happen. So, the only thing we can do is make sure that we're prepared to run our refinery at full rates. And given that we're just finishing our maintenance on the crude unit in the cokery \u2013 one of the two coker units at our refinery, we're set up for virtually no planned maintenance in the second half of 2019 through 2020. So, I think we're really well positioned to take advantage of whatever IMO turns out to be. And frankly, I think it's degrees of upside. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on I&D. The business has been performing very well in 2018. Do you see that business kind of moderating in coming years back to $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion in annual EBITDA or do you see a trajectory towards $2 billion kind of continuing? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, so the run rate, if you look back before this year, our run rate's been about $1.5 billion plus or minus. And I've talked about a 15% to 20% step-up that's structural, and I think that's how you ought to be thinking about it off of the $1.5 billion number. And then, there's some seasonality, as you know, with our oxyfuels business that puts some seasonality in that segment. But over an entire year, a 15% to 20% step-up over the $1.5 billion number is, I think, a good basis going forward. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. And just on polypropylene, maybe you can just give us your assessment of supply/demand. There hasn't really been a lot of new supply added. I mean, what's your view on whether the market could bear something like that or your own footprint? Thanks. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, polypropylene, I mean, in the U.S., there's not a lot of new capacity coming in the next 12 to 18 months, or 15 months, let's say. There's a few debottlenecks here and there including we have a couple of small ones that we're implementing now. I think in the absence of new capacity, and demand growing at 3%, 4% a year in the U.S., market looks to be very solid in the U.S. Globally, it seems that operating rates are still going to be quite high and, around the world, demand growth for polypropylene has been extremely strong and especially in the Far East, in China. So, I expect polypropylene to be a very constructive business going forward. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Advisors. You may go ahead. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Bob, two-part question on Braskem. First, obviously, you talked a bit about Brazil and the Brazilian elections and the like. But obviously there's been a government change in Mexico as well, and at least recently, I've been reading more and more articles pertaining to the Mexico contract, that it's below market, they may reconsider that contract. So, first part to the question is, how does that sort of go into your calculus about the deal? And then the second part is, obviously valuations have come down tremendously across the board but certain product areas have been hit harder, like polyurethanes in particular. So, how are you thinking about other deals as well above and beyond Braskem in light of some of these valuation moves? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. Good question. So first of all, on Braskem, I mean, I'd just kind of repeat what I said earlier. We're working through our analysis and obviously, thinking through the Mexico situation is part of our analysis. And so, we'll work through that. But it's a fairly new asset that they have down there. So, we consider that as well. As far as other alternatives, we just need to work through kind of one opportunity at a time and think through value creation. So, we're very focused on understanding the various aspects that have been raised on this call and things that you've read and being thoughtful about how we can create value for our shareholders. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Understood. Now as a follow-up, Bob, on the China pollution side of things, again, sort of mixed messages out there. Some people sort of talking about how regulation is going to move from federal to provincial levels and that may sort of make things a bit more lax, meaning thereby that maybe capacity comes back online. But then the flip side of that is that people are talking about the 2+26 being expanded to 11 more cities. So, what are you guys seeing on the ground there? How do you see that in terms of influx of new capacity or further curtailments? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, I think, directionally, environmental pressure will continue in China, and there will be some ebb and flow in terms of news. But I think, directionally, there is a move towards reducing coal and improving air quality in China, and I don't think that changes. So hence, more methanol being consumed for olefins. I mean, I think that will \u2013 it's cleaner than coal-based olefins, so we could see that, and some naphtha crackers I suppose. But I don't see the environmental pressures easing. I think, over time, they'll continue to get more stringent, as the rest of the world is. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Very helpful, Bob. Thanks so much. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. You may go ahead. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. We started with ethane, maybe we'll finish with ethane here. But on slide 11 again, in 2019, Bob, you have the supply line above the minimum. In midyear, doesn't the supply line kind of touch the minimum after we get a couple more crackers starting up? And then, in the upper right-hand corner, you've got $0.25 to $0.60 a gallon which is the historical range but I think ethane even at $1 a gallon still, export polyethylene is still breakeven. So, do you think if we get tighter in mid-2019, we could spike above $0.60? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. First of all, I don't know about the $1 analysis. I'll have to get my team to look at that, but depends on oil price and depends on naphtha price. So, there's a lot of factors. It's difficult, as you can imagine, to forecast a spike or to predict. I mean, I suppose you could see spikes but they're very much just that, they're spikes then they come back down. And I think one thing you've seen over the past few weeks and even years past that this industry and the cracker fleet in the U.S. does exert its flexibility when needed. And we as a company certainly are well positioned to do that. As I mentioned earlier in response to one of the other questions that we're also increasing our ability to crack Y-grade. So, I think that will be another dimension of flexibility that we'll continue to enhance. And our two crackers at Channelview and the Corpus Christi cracker are extremely well positioned to be flexible given proximity to Eagle Ford. And then when you think about our Midwest crackers, that's almost 2.5 billion pounds of ethylene that is unaffected by ethane price on the Gulf Coast and enjoys a significant advantage. So, I think the line sort of touching the blue part or not, we're going to have next year new crackers start up and new fractionation and new pipeline capacity as well. So, the price will be a bit more dynamic next year. But again, I step back and think about the overall supply of ethane and I think it's abundant. If even a little bit less gets rejected and comes down the pipe to Belvieu, that could change the equation very quickly. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Yeah, two quick ones. Given the discussions \u2013 or the way you're seeing the IMO impact play out for the refining industry, would you be open to reconsidering structures for the refining asset or treating it as a noncore asset? And secondly, how do you see Lyondell's role in the micro plastics debate? I mean, do you want to be at the forefront or is it more going to be see how the regulatory landscape shifts and then grow the recycling side of the business accordingly? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, two very different questions. On the refinery, Laurence, our view hasn't changed. Our focus has been on running the refinery better and better, and I think we've demonstrated now with six quarters of really great operating performance which we expect to continue. We've been positioning ourselves for IMO by completing our maintenance so that we can run essentially full in 2019 and 2020. And so, I think we're really well positioned to capture value from IMO. And we're not really detracted from that, if you will. And so, that's going to continue to be our focus and we'll think through how best to capture that value. So, really nothing further to add in terms of the refinery. In terms of micro plastics, and perhaps if I could broaden that to plastic waste, I think really one of the best ways a company like ours can influence what happens and how we engage is through the various associations around the world like American Chemistry Council, Cefic, and there's a lot of work going on through industry associations to engage in essentially ending plastic waste and thinking though over the long term how we can increase circularity. So, stay tuned. I think there will be some definitive sort of things that will come out as we go through the next couple of quarters. But I think this is best done from our perspective through the industry associations which we participate in and have leadership positions on in many cases. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Thank you. You may go ahead. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, Bob. It looks like in Refining, you outperformed some of your Gulf Coast peers in the quarter. You mentioned you saw some benefits from heavy Canadian barrels, which we estimate are approximately 15% to 20% of your crude slate. Could you talk about any potential efforts to increase WCS runs further whether that be by maybe crude by rail or whether you're looking at additional pipeline commitments on some of these new Canadian pipelines? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Yeah. So, Matthew, on Canadian crude, we've really maximized what we can do on Canadian crude. Maybe incrementally something around crude by rail, but I would not expect a meaningful change in the amount of Canadian crude we're cracking. And as you I'm sure know, those pipelines are on allocation, so we really can't get more allocation. But we are maximizing and I think, over time, we hope that that will impact Maya pricing and bring that back into balance. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Sounds good. And then, in I&D, you mentioned the PO results were off $50 million. I think $20 million of that was due to the turnaround. I guess the remaining $30 million or so, is that due to the market slowing and is that an issue perhaps with just slower demand growth from potentially weaker housing market? Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : No, nothing structural there. That's just ebbs and flow of the market. Nothing structural to read into that. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV : Well, let me offer a few closing remarks. Thank you for all of your patience as we've run over a little bit. So, as we look ahead from Q4 and into 2019, while we've talked a lot about ethane on this call, and we know it will be dynamic next year, for LyondellBasell, we do see meaningful sources of new earnings from our A. Schulman acquisition, our new polyethylene plant, step-up in I&D earnings, IMO impacts in the second half of the year. And I think a lot of these sources of earnings growth can offset potential impacts from new PE capacity and ethane. So, we look forward to updating you on that as well as all of our growth initiatives on the next call. So, thank you very much. Have a great day. And we're adjourned. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

The passcode for both numbers is 6482. During today\u2019s call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : All right. Thank you, Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world and thank you for joining our 2018 year-end earnings call. Let\u2019s begin with slide three and review the highlights for 2018 and our progress in advancing our value-driven growth strategy. Record setting earnings in our Intermediates and Derivatives and Technology segments partially offset declines, primarily in our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment to provide $4.7 billion of net income and $6.9 billion of EBITDA for the year. Increased cash generation helped to fund growth investments, while we improved our free cash flow yield by over 200 basis points and posted a strong 27% return on our invested capital during 2018. The acquisition of A. Schulman in August made LyondellBasell the world\u2019s largest plastics compounding company. In conjunction with this acquisition, we launched our Advanced Polymer Solutions business segment to provide focus and visibility for this new global platform and quickly went to work on integration that achieved an annualized synergy run rate of $47 million by the end of the year. Progress continues and we remain confident that we will meet or exceed our target to capture $150 million of integration related synergies within two years of the closing date. In March, we launched an innovative plastics recycling joint venture with Suez that provides a meaningful and sustainable solution for plastic waste. We are pleased with initial market demand for this premium recycled plastics and continue to optimize the operational and commercial performance of the business model with an eye toward replicating this model in other parts of Europe. We advanced our pipeline of organic growth projects during 2018 with our new Hyperzone HDPE plant scheduled for start-up in the third quarter of this year and construction of the world\u2019s largest PO/TBA plant on track for completion in the latter part of 2021. These projects not only increase our production capacity but also represent milestones for the commercialization of proprietary technologies, such as our new Hyperzone process for polyethylene and the latest developments from our advantaged propylene oxide and co-product technologies. We continue to actively manage our business portfolio with several small acquisitions and divestitures around the world, while we evaluate other opportunities, including a potential acquisition of Braskem. In the meantime, our cash flows enabled us to opportunistically repurchase 19.2 million shares of LyondellBasell\u2019s stock and return over $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2018, our company continued to deliver on our promise of value-driven growth through a balanced strategy of operational excellence, profitable organic expansions, accretive M&A and significant shareholder returns. Please turn to slide four, where I am proud to report that LyondellBasell\u2019s employees and contractors finished the year with a significant 14% improvement in our safety performance. During 2018, our injury rate was challenged by the need to improve upon the safety performance at the facilities we acquired from A. Schulman. We are diligently working to ensure all of our employees, contractors, assets and the communities in which we operate, finish the day in the same or better condition than they were at the start of the day. Our goal remains zero incidents or injuries every day of the year. Let\u2019s turn to slide five and review some of the detail behind our fourth quarter and annual results. Diluted earnings were $1.79 per share for the quarter and we earned $12.01 during the full year. As shown in the chart on the left, after excluding significant non-tax -- non-cash tax benefits in 2017 and 2018, earnings per share increased by approximately 10% in 2018. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we incurred $20 million of integration costs related to the Schulman acquisition that impacted quarterly earnings by $0.04 per share. Transaction and integration costs impacted the full year results by $0.14 per share. In addition to typical fourth quarter seasonal headwinds seen in our industry, our business was challenged by the substantial 40% fall in the price of crude oil that began in early October. Customers often delay orders and destock inventories during periods of declining oil prices, in expectations of lower petrochemical and plastics prices. Volumes decline in nearly every business across our six segments during the fourth quarter. As crude prices rebound in late December and January, our order volumes have improved. We have seen European and Asian industrial demand impacted by disruptions in the automotive sector arising from issues with Chinese consumer lending, new vehicle testing standards in Europe and trade uncertainties. We believe that global consumer demand remained strong and we will be closely watching trends in Asia after the Lunar New Year holidays in early February. During our third quarter earnings call, I outlined three major plan maintenance outages that were estimated to impact fourth quarter earnings by total of $95 million, extended maintenance, low Rhine River water levels and feedstock supply disruptions at one of our suppliers increased the fourth quarter impact to our O&P-EAI segment by approximately $110 million. Additionally, results were impacted by approximately $20 million by unplanned events in our Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining segments. Altogether, planned and unplanned downtime impacted our fourth quarter earnings by approximately $225 million. We do not expect such high levels of maintenance over the coming months. During the first half of 2019, our only planned maintenance is scheduled for the first quarter in our O&P-Americas segment. We expect that first quarter downtime will impact earnings for the whole company by approximately $60 million to $70 million. And now, Thomas, will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the year. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to slide six, which illustrates the developments of our business segments over the past two years. In 2018, LyondellBasell\u2019s business portfolio demonstrated remarkable resilience to changing market environments. Our Intermediates and Derivatives segment profitability improved by approximately 35% and for the first time exceeding $2 billion in EBITDA. Our Technology Group granted 16 licenses for new polyolefin plant designs that helped improve segment EBITDA by 47%. As seen in the chart, these improvements helped to offset declines in O&P-EAI. The profitability offsets provided by the geographic and product diversity of our business portfolio is a recurring theme for LyondellBasell and an attribute that we seek to maintain, manage and extend as we consider strategic options for the company. In Olefins and Polyolefins Americas, high industry margins for polyethylene helped to offset the majority of the decline in Olefin margins. Our business continues to benefit from strong demand and advantaged shale-based feedstocks that enabled us to retain 95% of our prior year profitability for the segment. The results for our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment includes contributions from the A. Schulman acquisition beginning in late August 2018. Our progress towards our goal of $150 million in synergies is on schedule and will become more apparent during 2019. Our Houston refinery run very well during 2018 and we completed all major scheduled maintenance for the next two years. We expect refining market conditions to rebalance during the first half of 2019 and look forward to strong refinery runs that will capture expected benefits of new sulfur regulations for marine fuels in late 2019 and 2020. Now please turn to slide seven, where you can see that our businesses generated $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities during the fourth quarter, which contributed to $5.5 billion of cash generation for the year. During the quarter, investment in capital expenditures increased to approximately $700 million, as we ramped up construction of our PO/TBA plant and continue to move our Hyperzone plant forward towards start up. As the stock market entered a correction during the fourth quarter, we significantly increased our share repurchases in response to lower share prices. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 11.5 million shares, the most in any quarter, since 2016. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share purchases during the fourth quarter. In 2018, our opportunistic buyback strategy allowed us to repurchase 8% more shares than would have occurred, if we deployed the same amount of cash in equal amounts every trading day of the year. The quarter closed with over $1.8 billion of cash and liquid investment on the balance sheet, we approximately -- with approximately $2.5 billion of unused and available credit facilities, we completed the quarter with a total liquidity in excess of $4 billion. Turning to slide eight, let\u2019s review our capital deployment over the past six years. The light blue bars depict our cash generation from operating activities, which has ranged between $4.8 billion to $6 billion since 2013. The stack bars on the right depict our uses of cash ranked in order of priority. Our highest priority is represented by the dark blue on the bottom, our progressively growing dividend. During 2018, we increased our dividend by 11%. This strong increase reflected an improved outlook after we updated our views on Tax Reform and the petrochemical industry. We have a top-quartile dividend that is currently yielding approximately 4.6% return. Our next priority is maintenance capital to support the safety and reliability of our operations. Going forward, this baseline investment is approximately $1.1 billion per year. The remainder of the orange bar is allocated to profit generating capital investment to support growth projects. We estimate this investment will increase to $1.7 billion in 2019. The gray bars reflect our share repurchases. We have returned over $18 billion in share repurchases since the inception of the program. Our buybacks add up to over 280 -- 208 million shares or 36% of the shares that were outstanding in 2013 at the inception of the program. Opportunistic share repurchase will continue to be a component of our capital deployment. The green bar represents last year\u2019s A. Schulman transaction, our first significant acquisition. We continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet that provides optionality to pursue value creating opportunities and we will continuously reevaluate the relative merits of organic projects, grows through M&A and share repurchases to optimize returns for our investors. Now please turn to slide nine, where I would like to address some of your annual modeling questions for 2019. Regarding capital, we are currently planning to invest approximately $2.8 billion during 2019 to support both our base maintenance and growth programs. Approximately 60% is targeted towards profit generating growth, the majority of this growth investment in 2019 will be dedicated to the new PO/TBA plant. Although not all plants are finalized, we estimate capital spending will average $2.8 billion annually through 2021. For 2019, we have a fairly typical plant maintenance schedule, activities during the year will impact annual EBITDA by approximately $160 million to $200 million. In addition to the first quarter plant maintenance in O&P Americas mentioned by Bob the segment will also have a cracker turnaround in the third quarter that is expected to impact EBITDA by approximately $70 to $80 million. In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment we have planned maintenance event that will impact EBITDA by approximately $30 million to $40 million in each of the third and fourth quarter. Our net cash interest expense for 2019 is expected to be approximately $400 million. 2019 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.3 billion. We plan to make regular pension contribution in 2019, that total $110 million and we estimate the pension expense of approximately $90 million. We currently expect that 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 20% and that our cash tax rate will be slightly lower than the effective tax rate. I will now turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Thank you. Bob Patel : Thank you, Thomas. Let\u2019s turn to slide 10 and review our segment results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $631 million, a $73 million decrease versus the third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was approximately $2.8 billion. Relative to the third quarter 2018, Olefins results improved by approximately $70 million due to higher ethylene prices and the declining Gulf Coast ethane costs. Our cracker operating rates averaged 93% during the fourth quarter, exceeding the average industry performance of 87%. Approximately 80% of our ethylene production was from ethane and 94% came from NGLs. Polyolefin results were approximately $115 million lower than the prior period primarily due to a $0.04 per pound decline in polyethylene spread over ethylene. For the full year, results decreased by $137 million, Olefin results declined by approximately $445 million primarily due to a $0.06 per pound reduction in ethylene price. Spread improvements in polyethylene and polypropylene of $0.07 per pound and $0.03 per pound, respectively, drove an approximately $360 million improvement in polyolefins to mostly offset the declines in Olefins. IHS is currently forecasting relatively stable polyethylene chain margins for the first quarter. We are optimistic that 2019 will offer our earnings growth for the segment has the pace of polyethylene capacity additions slows, while global demand growth remained steady. Please turn to slide 11 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segments. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $127 million or $135 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was $1.2 billion. We continue to optimize our portfolio in the fourth quarter by divesting a carbon black subsidiary in France. This benefited the quarter by $36 million. Compared to the third quarter, Olefins results decreased by approximately $75 million primarily driven by a decline in volume, combined Polyolefin results decreased approximately $35 million driven by decreased margins, equity income decreased by $43 million primarily due to planned maintenance at our Polish, Korean and Saudi joint ventures. Full year EBITDA results were $764 million lower than 2017. 2017 benefited from a gain of $108 million on the sale of our interest in Geosel, 2018 results included the benefit from the sale of our carbon black subsidiary and a favorable impact of approximately $95 million due to an increase in the euro versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to 2017. Olefin results for the full year decreased approximately $370 million compared to 2017. Increased feedstock costs during most of the year resulted in margin declines, while planned and unplanned maintenance and low Rhine River levels resulted in a volume decrease of approximately 10%. Combined Polyolefins results decreased approximately $345 million due to $0.03 per pound and $0.02 per pound lower spreads in polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. Joint venture equity income decreased by $46 million primarily due to lower Polyolefins spreads. In January, demand is improving, following the typical seasonal declines and destocking of the fourth quarter. On slide 12, let\u2019s take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $379 million, a decline of $125 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated over $2 billion setting an annual record and improving over the prior year by $521 million. Fourth quarter PO and Derivatives results decreased by approximately $10 million when compared with the prior period, primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher margins, Intermediate Chemicals decreased $65 million primarily due to reduced styrene and acetyls margins, Oxyfuels and Related Products results decreased approximately $40 million driven by margin declines due to higher ethanol pricing relative to crude oil and a volume decline due to planned maintenance. During 2018, the $521 million improvement in EBITDA was largely driven by margin improvements across all products due to tight market conditions and improved contracting strategies. We are very proud of the team\u2019s accomplishments in 2018 and we expect continued benefits from this work in future years. While IHS is forecasting some moderation in methanol pricing for the first quarter, we should see improved PO and Derivatives volumes for the segment due to the completion of the planned maintenance at our Bayport, Texas facility during the fourth quarter. Slide 13 charts the full year results from I&D business improvements we discussed during our second quarter earnings call. You might recall that while the majority of the increased profitability was attributable to tight market conditions and reduced maintenance downtime at our facilities, we also described LyondellBasell\u2019s improved contracting strategies and reliability as sources of durable improvements that should persist beyond 2018. Historically, our Intermediates and Derivatives segment generated relatively consistent EBITDA that averaged approximately $1.5 billion per year. We believe our new midpoint in typical markets will be approximately $1.7 billion, while the strong markets seen in 2018 may moderate, we do not believe these improved margins will fully revert in 2019. In addition, we have not stopped pursuing self-help within this business. This year we expect I&D contracting improvements to provide an additional $100 million of annual EBITDA for the segment starting in mid 2019. On slide 14, let\u2019s review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $86 million, a $16 million improvement over the prior period. For the full year, EBITDA was $400 million. Fourth quarter transaction and integration costs were $20 million. Compounding and Solutions results improved approximately $15 million over the third quarter, as we realized the full quarter of contribution from the addition of A. Schulman product lines. This was partially offset by volume and margin declines in polypropylene compounds. Advanced Polymers results decreased approximately $15 million due to lower margins and volumes. Full year EBITDA results for the segment were $38 million lower than 2017. Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition impacted the segment by a $69 million in 2018. Compounding and Solutions results improved approximately $15 million, with higher volumes from new product lines, partially offset by lower volume and margin in polypropylene compounds. Advanced Polymers results increased approximately $15 million due to higher volumes. Integration activities are well underway and we have captured $47 million in forward annualized run rate synergies as of December 31st. We expect to see continued improvement in this segment, as we begin 2019 with a return of higher seasonal volumes and our continued focus on capturing value from the integration activities. Turning to slide 15, let\u2019s discuss the performance of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was negative $84 million, $168 million decline from the third quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was $167 million or a $10 million improvement over 2017. Planned maintenance on one of our two crude and coker trains was completed in November. As a result, the average crude throughput was 184,000 barrels per day or 48,000 barrels per day less than the third quarter. With this work behind us, the Refinery is prepared to run full rates for the next two years and benefit from expected market opportunities. In the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread declined significantly, averaging less than an $11 per barrel for the first quarter and only $9.57 during November. Over the previous 12 years, the Maya 2-1-1 has been below $10 for only one month in December of 2011. The average over this time period is more than $22 per barrel. Spreads are improving as Pemex adjusts a monthly K factor of the Maya crude oil price formula to ensure that Mexican crude remains competitively priced for the U.S. Gulf Coast refining market. For the full year, Refining margins increased when compared with 2017 due to discounted Canadian crude pricing and improved fluid catalytic cracker conversion rates. Crude throughput was 231,000 barrels per day in 2018, slightly lower than 2017. Absent our recent planned maintenance, throughput would have averaged 256,000 barrels per day for the full year. I\u2019d like to congratulate our refinery team for their diligent work and dedication to improve our Refinery reliability. With our planned maintenance completed, we look forward to stronger contributions from our Refinery in 2019 as we continue to benefit from improved reliability and an increase to Maya 2-1-1 crack spread. I would not like to turn to slide 16 and speak with you about a topic of growing global concern, the management of plastic waste. I think most of you are well aware of how billions of people benefit from advances in plastic. In fact, our products are well aligned with the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals such as a reducing hunger and food spoilage by durable packaging. Delivering safe drinking water with plastic pipes and reducing energy consumption with innovative materials. However, we now face the growing problem of what to do with the plastic once it has served its initial purpose. The concern over plastic waste management is leading governments and consumers to consider bans on plastic straws and bags. But these products make up only a small fraction of the plastic waste that ends up in our oceans. Some suggests that we should replace all plastics with alternative materials, but most alternatives bring higher overall environmental and economic costs. On slide 17, I am very proud to highlight an alliance formed by LyondellBasell along with more than 25 of our industry peers and other participants across the value chain that make, use, sell, process, collect and recycle plastics. Together, we have committed over $1 billion with the goal of investing $1.5 billion over the next five years in collaborative partnerships to advance meaningful solutions that eliminate plastic waste in our environment. The alliance\u2019s approach is based on four pillars, infrastructure that stops plastic waste from entering the environment, innovation in materials, technologies and business models that increased the value of plastic waste, engagement with partners and government, business and consumers to enable solutions, and meaningful projects to cleanup plastic waste that has already escaped into our environment, new infrastructure to prevent and cleanup plastic waste is especially important in emerging economies where collection practices often lag the developed world. Once plastic is collected and appropriately sorted, the waste can become a valuable feedstock for technologies that create versatile new materials from these post-used plastics. LyondellBasell\u2019s QCP recycling joint venture with Suez is an example of an innovative business model that embraces this vision for a circular plastics economy. Education and engagement with governments, businesses and communities is critical to the success of these initiatives. The collaborative work of our alliance will be more powerful and efficient than fragmented efforts by each member of company working alone. Our surveys show that 10 rivers transport more than 90% of the river based plastics to the ocean and more than 50% of land based plastic waste leakage comes from only five countries. There will be a focus on developing solutions that stop this leakage at their sources and cleanup areas with the existing plastic waste by recognizing the value of reusing plastic. While we certainly have an immense challenge ahead of us, I am confident that our alliance will find meaningful solutions to help end plastic waste and create a sustainable future for our industry and our planet. Now let\u2019s turn to slide 18 and discuss the outlook for 2019. Ethylene feedstocks were volatile during the second half of 2018 with U.S. Gulf Coast ethane prices spiking up in September and then reverting in November. As we discussed during our third quarter earnings call, LyondellBasell has the optionality across our U.S. assets with ethylene production from both low cost Midwest ethane and feedstock flexibility at our Gulf Coast crackers. NGL prices are likely to show some volatility during 2019 with increased demand from the remaining new ethylene crackers likely to arrive ahead of planned NGL pipeline and fractionation capacity additions. We expect that this pattern of prolong startups for ethylene crackers along with NGL supply additions will smooth the path forward towards forecast for a return to plentiful feedstock availability within the next year. We are encouraged by a forecast for polyethylene demand growth to continue with long-term historical ranges of 4% to 5%. Over the past three years, capacity additions have surpassed demand and moderated operating rates, with less global capacity scheduled to start-up during 2019 and 2020, we believe that LyondellBasell\u2019s new Hyperzone HDPE capacity will find favorable markets as we ramp-up during the second half of this year. Turning to slide 19, let me summarize the year\u2019s highlights. In 2018, our strong earnings were supported by record annual EBITDA in our Intermediates and Derivatives and Technology segments. We will continue to benefit from some of the improvements from both segments through contracting changes in I&D and licensing growth in Technology. Our company generated approximately $5.5 billion of cash from operating activities. This strong cash generation contributed to growth through profit generating capital investments and the acquisition of A. Schulman. Furthermore, we continue to provide significant shareholder returns through a growing top-quartile dividend and $1.9 billion in share repurchases. By completing the acquisition of A. Schulman, we have created the world\u2019s largest plastics compounding business and we are well underway with integration activities that are capturing significant synergies in our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Our strong cash flows and healthy balance sheet leave us well-positioned to take advantage of additional value creating inorganic opportunities. In 2018, we advance on the construction of our Hyperzone polyethylene plant and we look forward to the added profitability will contribute to our O&P Americas segment, following the startup in the third quarter. Last August, we also began construction of PO/TBA plant that will start up in 2021 providing further earnings growth for our I&D segment. We move forward on sustainable solutions for our company by forming quality circular polymers, our premium plastics recycling joint venture with Suez. And in collaboration with our industry leaders we formed the alliance to end plastic waste to generate sustainable global solutions for plastic waste that will benefit our industry and the environment. Going into 2019, we look forward to increase production and availability of shale-based feedstocks and a moderation in the pace of capacity additions that should provide a favorable environment for our new HDPE capacity and that allow us to maximize value from our diverse global business portfolio. With that said, we are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, fellows. Bob Patel : Good morning. Duffy Fischer : First question, IHS is calling last year polyethylene demand up about 7%, which is pretty meaningfully higher than, say, the 20-year run rate. One, would you agree with that, and two, where was that extra demand coming from, what caused that to accelerate in your mind? Bob Patel : So, Duffy, we in fact did see that especially in the first three quarters of the year, quite a bit of it was in the Pipe and Packaging segment of the business. So not only here in the U.S., but more exports as well which drove global demand growth. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then on the supply side, again several of the global consultants now have less -- they would have in excess of 20 new naphtha plants coming online in China. They kind of call it 2021 and beyond, obviously you guys got some insight into that with your licensing business. How should we think about what the knowledge base you have kind of across that space, what will that wave look like, obviously it\u2019s not going to be that many, but is it 10, is it 15, how many in that mid 20s periods should we think about naphtha crackers in China? Bob Patel : Yeah. Duffy, as we have our discussions, we don\u2019t see that magnitude in that timeframe, a lot of them are under consideration. But I would say the timeline is much later than what\u2019s described and so we will look for those updates as those projects reach final investment decisions, but we expect that -- those will go forward further in terms of timing. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you guys. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Bob Patel : Good morning. David Begleiter : Bob, just some on Braskem, is there a point where you need to make a decision either way and just move forward as is has been sorry to, say, dragging on for quite a while here? Bob Patel : Yeah. Well, David, we have -- it\u2019s a very -- as I have talked about in the past it\u2019s a very complex transactions. And in terms of the timeline, the part of the protracted timeline has been the pause because of the change in government and given sort of the shareholder ownership that you all know about Braskem. So I can tell you that we have completed very high quality due diligence. We have a few follow-up items. But I think as we sit here today, we better understand issues and value creation drivers. We had been in discussions with relevant stakeholders, including Auto Brasch. We don\u2019t know whether these discussions will lead to an agreement. We will -- and but I can tell you we\u2019d only move forward at the right price and if we believe the transaction creates significant value for all of our stakeholders. David Begleiter : Very helpful. And just one last thing, Bob, on O&P Americas EBITDA in 2019, I think, you said you think you can grow this business in \u201819 versus \u201818. Can you provide a little more color on that thought process, given again some new capacity coming on stream and low polyethylene prices in Q4? Bob Patel : Yeah. I think a lot of that, David, is the Hyperzone plant, our new polyethylene capacity coming online. You will recall today, ethylene margins are -- have been very thin, so to the extent that we can integrate downstream and capture more of the ethane to polyethylene chain margin that will contribute and it\u2019s a world scale plant. So it will make a difference in terms of the O&P Americas profitability. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Bob are you -- I am looking at your table two, with the volume that you sold, obviously in polyethylene in the U.S. it was the lowest number on that page and I am assuming the same is true in many of the other products around the world. So are you carrying a lot of inventory into 2019 and assuming you run at usual production rate should we -- should 2019 be a much bigger volume year on an organic basis? Bob Patel : Yeah. So in terms of inventory, no, we are not carrying unusually high amounts of inventory across our entire system. So I think there is some inventory build for turnaround that we are expecting here in the U.S. of our largest polyethylene plant. It\u2019s a 2 billion pound per year of polyethylene plant that will have a turnaround in the Q1. Otherwise, the inventories, we don\u2019t see is being high across the system. And frankly, downstream because the destocking happened and we think that inventories are quite moderate or kind of below average downstream as well. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And as a -- as a -- go ahead. Thomas Aebischer : When you look at the inventory difference year-over-year on a cash basis, it\u2019s about a $90 million change versus 2017, so really small. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And in the I&D business, one of the bright spots in 2018 was the acetyls chain and the spot margins, if you look at those have just come in considerably since the third quarter of \u201818, what are your expectations for those margins can get back to in 2019? Bob Patel : Well, Vincent, I mean, it\u2019s difficult to predict where they will go. But you have seen the potential in \u201818 and the correction has been fairly significant. So we will have to see how that develops. I think when you think about our I&D business, the methanol, the acetyls and the styrene margins tend to be the most dynamic part of the portfolio. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, underlying all of that, we have more contracting improvements that will accrue to the earnings of I&D starting about mid-year. So, I think, we have reached that sort of the base in I&D from 1.5 to 1.7 and if styrene and methanol markets turn out to be directionally what they were in \u201818, then we should have another very strong year in I&D. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Sounds great. Thanks so much. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov. Your line is open, sir. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. You indicated in one of the slides where your -- you expect PO/TBA earnings to be based on the average for 2014, 2018 margins. But where are the margins today relative to that historical average? Bob Patel : I don\u2019t know where the margins are today versus the historical average. But we tend to take periods of time when we communicate, because if we take narrower timeframes, price margins can be much higher or lower. So we are very constructive about the market. And if you think about TBA, and specifically, MTBE last year, especially in the second half, gasoline demand and gasoline margins were quite low. So we think some improvement in that in addition to lower butane prices which we saw during the winter. We think those that boded very well for the MTBE part of our I&D business. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you, Bob. And you spend some time in recycling, how strong is the business case for some capital deployment into -- to recycling today and also do you see sort of some threat to plastics demand in the near-term and over the next 12 months, 24 months, especially in Europe from government policies here? Bob Patel : Well, so first of all, what we have learned from our QCP joint venture is that, collection and segregation are very important and in the past what has ailed the recycling business is this -- that the input is very mixed. And so I think that\u2019s what\u2019s the differential about our joint venture with Suez as we get relatively segregated polyolefin waste that and is further segregated in our venture and then washed and then recycled. In terms of impact on demand, I think, it will take a bit of time for the infrastructure to get in place and to be built out. So in the near-term, we don\u2019t expect, meaning the next two years, three years, four years and we don\u2019t expect a meaningful impact, and we will just have to watch and see the pace of infrastructure growth. In terms of Europe, I can tell you that even in recent meetings with that my team has had with leadership in Brussels, the focus is more on a circular economy rather than de-selection of plastics and that was again reaffirmed in recent discussions. So we think that our approach with the QCP venture is very well placed and the idea for us is to now build out that platform throughout Europe, and we are focused on doing that. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Bob Patel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Koort. Your line is open. Dylan Campbell : Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. A quick question, one of your competitors is pushing a price increase for, they were for January and they are for February for polyethylene in Americas. I guess what is Lyondell\u2019s expectation for the first quarter here for polyethylene price and given that at least one consultant is saying that inventory levels are at the highest level and maybe a decade? Bob Patel : Well, first of all, I don\u2019t want to comment on direction of prices here on the call. But I can tell you that as we look at January, we are seeing in the U.S. more return to more normal demand and we expect as February, March and April progress, seasonally we tend to see an uptick in demand, because of packaging and so on, and what we hear from our customers is that, that seasonal uptick in demand should be expected. And if you think about downstream inventories, because of the destocking that occurred with the reducing oil price, we think downstream inventory are quite lean. So when you look at inventories, you really have to look at the inventories in the chain rather than just in one part of the chain. And so, I think, all this will normalize and our sense is, if you step back and look at operating rates globally, they still look to be among the highest we have seen in polyethylene in the past four years. So I think the setup is very constructive for the entire year, given that demand typically grows in the first two quarters to three quarters of the year. And so, I mean, I think, operating rates are high and that points to a very constructive market. Dylan Campbell : Got it. Thank you. And I guess a quick clarification question. You guys mentioned, polyethylene to ethylene spreads declined $0.04 per pound sequentially quarter-over-quarter. But I guess if I look in your data supplement, polyethylene prices declined by only $0.01 per pound to $0.02 per pound and ethylene was fairly flat quarter-over-quarter. I guess was Lyondell selling a bigger discount versus the market or can you just help working me through that math? Bob Patel : Sure. So that you are referring to the polyethylene gasoline margin for us and the way we transfer ethylene price internally is, it\u2019s a spot -- it\u2019s a blend of contract and spot and you will note that in Q4 we saw a rising spot price of ethylene. So really there was more margin in Olefins and a little bit less in polyethylene. It\u2019s not a reflection on the revenue of polyethylene. Dylan Campbell : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan. Your line is open sir. Arun Viswanathan : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, first off, just wanted to ask about kind of the level of earnings here was kind of penetrated pretty substantially in Q4 to 1.2, 1.3, I guess we saw like a 1.4, 1.5 in Q4 of \u201816. I guess what gives you guys the confidence in this snap back in Q2 through Q4. I guess, I am just curious on Europe and Refining as well, feedstocks have come down in Europe, is there a possibility that you could see some recovery there or would be -- or pricing would be challenged to take in a lower feedstock environment like that? Thanks. Bob Patel : Yeah. Thanks, Arun. First of all, so if you think about Q4, there were kind of three big drivers that we think are kind of one-offs. First of all, we talked about the environment of declining crude oil price and the related destocking, and how price moves in that kind of environment, a 40% decline in one quarter is really enormous and that\u2019s largely played out and oil prices rebounded. So we think that\u2019s constructive as we look at first half of \u201819. In terms of Europe and EAI, just from one cracker turnaround that extended past our planned window and the Rhine River and some, so we had one of our suppliers of feedstock had a disruption, that all we think impacted earnings by about $100 million in Q4 largely behind us. Rhine River is back to normal levels, our cracker is expected to be for most of the quarter at full rate, so $100 million impact we think is really isolated to Q4. And then in Refining, I mean, we are sitting here with Maya 2-1-1 spreads that are the lowest we have seen since the \u201808 timeframe and what\u2019s driven that is a few factors. First of all, you will recall that the K -- the so called K factor is what get determines the delta between Mexican crude and light crude, if you will, that K factor has been slow to adjust, so the light-heavy differential has been almost zero of late. So we think that will revert, we are already seeing some correction to the K factor and we expect more to come and of a long gasoline market that I described, which may persist, I don\u2019t know. But I do think the light-heavy differential and in particular, how Maya is priced, we should see improvement as the quarter progresses. So largely the maintenance impacts in Europe were isolated to one unit and they are kind of behind us. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up, maybe, could you -- I don\u2019t know what you can say on this, but maybe if you could just explain, maybe from a high level some of the strategic benefits in a potential Braskem deal, would it allow you to reduce your long ethylene position and it obviously will grow in polypropylene. But and then also how do you feel about the vinyls chain and participating there, is that something that is, would be considered core to you guys? Thanks. Bob Patel : Yeah. So in terms of the strategic merits, I mean, I think, and first of all, when you think about Brazil. The outlook for Brazil continues to improve and the expectations are positive under the new government. So and it\u2019s an economy, if you look at the IMF report, it\u2019s one of the few in the world that\u2019s expected to grow at a reasonably good rates. We think longer-term the economy there hold good potential, a scenario where we don\u2019t have much of a position, so it makes us even more of a global producer and seller of Polyolefins. In the case of the U.S. and Europe there is in part a consolidation opportunity and also a lot of our technology is deployed within Braskem. So those are just a few of the merits -- strategic merits of a transaction like that. As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s got to be at the right price and it has to be significantly value creating for our shareholders. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar. Your line is open. PJ Juvekar : Yes. Hi. Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. PJ Juvekar : On Refining, you didn\u2019t mention IMO 2020 and we are hearing some mixed reviews about the benefit of IMO 2020 to GRMs, I was wondering if you could comment on that? Bob Patel : Well, thank you for asking that. I was hoping somebody would ask me, so I could work it into my commentary. I mean, I think, P.J., IMO we still see meaningful impact, especially because we have such a heavy crude processing refinery. Yes, recent press suggests that maybe some of the impact will be muted. We actually think if we look at forward curves now perhaps the expectations have corrected to the low side, whereas perhaps at the end of last year, there was a little bit more enthusiasm. We do continue to believe that there will be a positive impact from IMO starting in late Q3 into Q4 as the inventory is rotated into the lower sulfur and diesel and that\u2019s deployed across the network around the world and then 2020 we do expect some meaningful impact from IMO 2020. So but the thing we can control is, we have got to operate well, and I think, we have positioned ourselves by completing all of our maintenance to run at full rates and capture whatever opportunity lies ahead and I continue to think that there will be a meaningful benefit and late this year into 2020. PJ Juvekar : Great. Thank you. And secondly, I am glad to see you taking the lead on plastic recycling issue. I think the industry needed to do something there. I guess when you look at plastic recycling, the issue has been the economics of recycling and recycling never made any money in developed markets like the U.S., maybe it makes money in the emerging markets because of cheaper labor, but can you talk about the economics of that and how do you work that into the solution? Bob Patel : Well, I think, P.J., well, first of all, I appreciate the recognition in terms of the momentum around the alliance and so on, and it\u2019s -- credit goes to a lot of companies who have been really a catalyst for getting this going. In terms of the economics of recycling, as I mentioned earlier, really better collection and segregation of the source is critical to the economics and then building up scale and doing the recycling closer to where the waste is collected as it\u2019s adding costs by moving waste around the world detracts from the economics. So -- and to tell you that\u2019s what we are focused on as -- with the QCP venture in Europe and we believe it\u2019s a model that can be replicated, certainly within Europe and as we develop that further we will think about other jurisdictions around the world. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. Bob Patel : All right. Thank you. David Kinney : Yeah. If we could limit to one question, we still have eight folks in the queue and I don\u2019t want to take up your lunch hour there today. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard. Your line is open. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning. Bob Patel : Good morning. Jonas Oxgaard : If we are sticking to the plastic waste here, you have a slide there 17 it shows four different pillars. Can you talk a little bit about how do you actually intend to or how does the alliance intend to invest here? Are they giving grants to companies, universities, is that you are expected to do it in-house? And can you give us a little bit of a breakdown on how much do you think is going to be focused on each of the four pillars? Bob Patel : Well, so that the -- in terms of the allocation, there will be -- we will move in parallel on all four. There is not waiting more strongly towards one or the other. But if you were to go to the website, endplasticwaste.org you can see the initial actions the alliance will take which were backing and supporting an effort through a company called Renewlogy that is converting waste plastic into fuel. There is a fund called Circulate Capital that\u2019s funding initiatives around the world that directionally end plastic waste. So, Jonas, I\u2019d encourage you to look at that and that\u2019s going to be -- we want to move on all four fronts. We do believe that we have got a slow down and stop which entering the environment, we need to address what\u2019s already in the environment and education and innovation are going to be what\u2019s going to make this more sort of structural and sustainable part in the fund over the long period of time. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts. Your line is open. John Roberts : Thank you. Slide 18 talks about the expected volatility in ethane, which I assume is even after the Sasol cracker has been pushed out to the back end of this year. Do you think the industry needs to do additional here in the short-term to maybe pulling forward some downtime to ease up on the ethane pressures that might cause another spike? Bob Patel : Yeah. So, John, that some of the news around the delays is quite fresh and we have not included that in our analysis here. But indeed you are right that what I have read certainly says that, there are some incremental delays in some of the new crackers coming. So our view is that in a lower oil price environment like we have and you will recall last year we said that more of the NGLs that are coming from the Permian contain more butane and propane as ethane was rejected, which caused kind of this run up in ethane. All of this is to say that alternative feedstocks like propane, butane, liquids will be very competitive at lower oil price, more propane and butane available especially after we get through the winter season and export capacity in the near-term is we don\u2019t know of any really big new capacity coming for propane. So I think that in the environment that we are in, you could say that the volatility should be less, if at all, especially with the delays. So -- and you saw some evidence of that in Q4 when oil price dropped, you actually saw propane and butane become a lot cheaper and they were very competitive as feedstocks. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Bob Patel : Good morning. Kevin McCarthy : Bob, I was wondering if you could elaborate on your outlook for olefins and polyolefins EAI. If you look back to the prior oil collapse in late \u201814, that segment really enjoyed a nice year in 2015, up nearly $450 million, and listening to you today, it doesn\u2019t sound so you are as constructive on that segment relative to the Americas, for example, notwithstanding, some of the one-timers, Rhine River, et cetera. So would you compare and contrast the current environment versus what we saw in the following oil collapse or the previous one, sorry? Bob Patel : Right. So, Kevin, in the Q4 we had a significant reset in prices and I think that\u2019s, because of oil price declining, that\u2019s occurred. And my team tells me that in January orders look very good in Europe, so we have seen demand come back. And so I am actually quite constructive about the supply/demand balance in Europe. So and I think there will be some impetus to improve profitability as the year goes on. Again, if you step back and you look at global operating rates rising this year and now that supply chain could reset because of the declining oil price we are coming into a seasonally strong period. This is a -- all of this is a set up for improving profitability as we work through the first half of the year. And I think EAI should benefit from the higher global operating rates and the oil price correction behind us, so I am actually quite positive about EAI. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Hey. Good morning. And, Bob, I guess, I now have to start watching your interaction at industry events with Frank Bozich. Hey, you said earlier that you are closely watching Asia post Chinese New Year, obviously, it starts in less than a week and I am curious as to what your best guesses as to what we will see particularly with respect to the automotive markets, obviously, very important for polypropylene. What are your expectations that we are going to see in a few weeks\u2019 time there? Bob Patel : Well, I think, ultimately, we will see what happens in about 10 days or 14 days. But, I think, Frank, given that we have been through a pretty big destocking cycle and my view at least on the packaging and the non-durable side is that, demand is growing and all of sort of the demographic factors that we have discussed in the past that is still in place. In terms of automotive, I think, credit is loosening over there and the middle class is growing. So it seems to me that demand for automobiles should be constructive, barring some event that none of us can predict. So I am quite optimistic and hopeful about what we will see post Chinese New Year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed. Your line is open. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan Ahmed : Well, the question on the U.S. ethylene market, as we took a look at \u201818, obviously, there was extreme volatility I\u2019d actually even call it a fairly sloppy market. Beyond obviously oil doing what it did, I think, one of the main reasons was obviously a mismatch between ethylene capacity coming online, derivatives not sort of following suit immediately. It seems now that as we look at \u201819, both ethylene and deriv capacity seems to be coming online in lockstep. So is it fair to assume that the ethylene market in the U.S. should not actually see the sort of volatility we saw last year? Bob Patel : Indeed, I mean, I think, Hassan, the volatility could come from the degree of reliability we see in the various crackers and as new very large world scale units come online, can imagine if one 3 billion pound cracker comes offline and that could cause a significant change in the supply/demand balance. The other thing that, I think, we will have to watch is the timing of derivative expansions versus cracker expansions. If derivative expansions come sooner, that could actually cause more firmness in the ethylene market. I think the opposite is unlikely, with anything, derivatives could come a little bit earlier, especially in one or two projects that are more integrated in terms of their setup. Thomas Aebischer : It\u2019s not just polyethylene, it\u2019s glycols, it\u2019s alpha-olefins and lot of other ethylene consumers as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Oils rebounded since the beginning of the year from roughly 50 to 60 in brent terms, but hopefully and really hasn\u2019t moved in the United States, maybe polymer grade is still a little bit under $0.40 and it\u2019s come down from $0.60. Can you talk about some of the dynamics that have pushed propylene down, what are your expectations for this year and are you surprised that it hasn\u2019t moved? Bob Patel : Well, I think, Jeff, as we see more PDH capacity come into the market, it will probably reduce the volatility of propylene, because now you have a bigger base that generally runs and is not dependent on feedstock flexibility, right. So that\u2019s been part of the source of propylene price volatility is when feedstocks change in the past that it had a big impact on the amount of propylene volume that was available. But now as the base of PDH capacity grows, it will probably act to stabilize and maybe reduce some of the volatility. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne. Your line is open. Ian Bennett : Hi. Thanks. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. The past couple of quarters as Lyondell\u2019s EBITDA has been declining, your net debt has been increasing to buy back more stock and I think that sends a strong message about your view of the longer term trajectory of the earnings and value of this business. If EBITDA were to continue to decline, how willing are you two continue to increase net debt to buy back stock and does that affect your ability at all to pursue Braskem? Bob Patel : Yeah. I will have -- Thomas will take that question. Thomas Aebischer : Well, thank you, Ian, for the question. So, I think, if you look, so first of all, we took a significant advantage of attractive share price, especially in the fourth quarter. We have always said that we are buying back our own share opportunistically. I think it\u2019s, when you ask your question it\u2019s important to note that the -- we obviously increased net debt, you are absolutely right. But the main reason to increase net debt or the reason is actually the Schulman acquisition. So if you look at cash flow from operating activity, is $5.5 billion for the year. We have CapEx of $2.1 billion and dividend and share buybacks of $3.1 billion. So for the share buyback program we actually did what we always said, that we are using excess cash flow to buy back our own shares. Now we are at a point where we have to make decisions as the share price stays attractive to actually raise debt in order to replenish our debt portfolio, which we have used the cash to -- for the acquisition of Schulman. So we have sufficient funds as I said, the liquidity is about $4 billion. We have sufficient funds to pursue our growth initiatives, as well as to continue with our share buybacks opportunistically. Bob Patel : Yeah. And Ian, if you think, step back and strategically look at what we have been doing. We have been looking to create shareholder value by pulling a number of levers. We had meaningful organic growth in \u201818, inorganic growth with the Schulman acquisition and we bought back a meaningful number of our shares. So I think you ought to look for that to continue, because this is a company that has many levers and we will look for the one that creates the most value as we think about deploying our operating cash flow or our balance sheet. Operator : And our last question comes from Matthew Blair. Your line is open. Matthew Blair : Hey. Good morning, Bob. So last quarter enterprise announced a couple of new PDH plants, we are wondering, if you can say whether you are a customer here and how might this affect your potential polypropylene and I guess potential PDH plant as well? Bob Patel : Yeah. So with all of the other initiatives we have had going on, we have kind of, with the PP plant we are still considering it and certainly the buy versus build scenario on propylene is one that we are contemplating today. And as you know from your conference, I know, Jim very well, and I spent some time with them, so that\u2019s an option, depending on the economics of buy versus build. We will continue to evaluate that. Operator : Thank you. And we have no other questions at this time. Bob Patel : Okay. Great. Well let me offer a few closing remarks, if I may. So, after a challenging fourth quarter, where a typical seasonality was exacerbated by declines in crude oil. We are looking forward to rebounding demand from restocking of supply chains. In 2019 we will continue to accrue synergies in our APS segment from the Schulman acquisition. We look forward to growth from our new Hyperzone production and anticipate an improving refining market, with a lighter planned maintenance schedule in 2019, we are really well prepared to maximize production to meet the needs of growing markets and our global business portfolio provides resilience, we are well-positioned to pursue any other value creating opportunities. So thank you for your interest and we look forward to updating you in April on our first quarter results. With that we are adjourned. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :30 PM Eastern Time today until 12 :59 AM Eastern Time on June 25th by calling 888-568-0028 in the United States and 203-369-3451 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 3108. During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives. That being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thanks Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. During the first quarter, our Company demonstrated strong operational performance and moved forward on our value-driven growth strategy by advancing our business portfolio and delivering on synergies. Sales volumes for our Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International business increased to levels seen during the first and second quarters of 2018, while profitability improved to regain some of last year's margin compression, more than doubling our fourth quarter EBITDA for that segment. Across the Company, five of our six business segments improved upon fourth quarter profitability. First quarter earnings were $2.19 per share, which represents a 22% improvement over the previous quarter. We continue to actively manage our business portfolio by acquiring a synthesis gas plant in La Porte, Texas. This acquisition included a minority interest in our former methanol joint venture at the site. The same gas plant converts natural gas into raw materials that we use in the production of methanol and acetic acid. We expect the transaction will provide synergies and operational efficiencies to generate accretive returns and materially exceed LyondellBasell's high standards for investment. In the seven months since we closed on our acquisition of A. Schulman in 2018, our synergy capture increased to an $85 million annual run rate by the end of the first quarter. This represents more than half of the annual synergies we initially expected to realize within two years. These synergies are becoming apparent in our advanced Polymer Solution's profitability and we anticipate exceeding our initial $150 million annual synergy target. Our organic growth program is in full swing with our new hyper-zone polyethylene technology approaching a third quarter start up in La Porte and considerable progress underway on construction of the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant at our sites in Channelview and Bayport in Texas. This new capacity from these investments will serve global market's growing demand for polyethylene, polyurethanes and transportation fuels. As we continue our evaluation of the potential transaction with Braskem, the Company remains committed to a strong and progressive dividend while pursuing opportunistic share repurchases. LyondellBasell returned an additional $884 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter. All of our capital allocation decisions are guided by our commitment to be a solid investment grade Company. Two years ago, at our Investor Day in New York, we described how LyondellBasell's resilient business portfolio and a more balanced approach to capital deployment would provide strong shareholder returns while also supporting long-term value driven growth. I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter, employees of our Company continued to deliver on these promises and advance the strategy. Each year marks a fresh start for tracking safety performance and 2018 will be the first full year where our metrics include the 20-plus percent of our workforce who joined LyondellBasell with the Schulman acquisition. Prior to the acquisition in 2018, Schulman's injury rate was 1.54, seven to eight times higher than typical LyondellBasell performance. On Slide 4, you can see that our first quarter combined safety performance is quite similar to the record setting levels we achieved for the full year 2018. As you know, we strongly believe that safety performance is a leading indicator of strong operational results. The rapid improvement in these safety metrics provides further evidence of the deep and robust integration management process underway within LyondellBasell. All employees want to go home to their families safely and we're grateful for the sense of ownership displayed by our employees and their frontline supervisors. We look forward to driving further improvements towards our goal of injury free operations. And now, Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the first quarter. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, Bob and good day to all of you. Please turn to Slide 5, which illustrates developments within our Company over the trailing 12 months. Our portfolio of diverse petrochemical businesses continues to be a source of resilience during times of challenging market conditions with improvements in two segments partially offsetting declines in other segments over the past year. As Bob mentioned, during the first quarter, five of our six business segments posted higher profitability relative to the previous quarter. Total EBITDA for the trailing 12 months declined in comparison to a relatively strong prior-year period. During the first quarter, we incurred service disruptions related to the March fire at a third-party terminal in the Houston Ship Channel. The impact was primarily felt within our Intermediates and Derivatives segment and was not material to the Company's first quarter result. We are still assessing ongoing disruptions and we expect second quarter impact will be similar to slightly higher than the first quarter. In North America, falling ethylene prices had declined faster than feedstock costs and the steep drop in propylene prices drove first quarter margin compressions for olefins. In the rest of the world, olefins and polyethylene margins improved on the back of strong volume recoveries, relative to the fourth quarter. Our Intermediates and Derivatives businesses exhibited stability with relatively balanced markets, persisting through a - the typical slow fourth and first quarters. We continue to run the Houston refinery well with our ninth consecutive quarter of strong operations. Unfortunately, high gasoline inventories and low discounts for heavy sour crude oil, resulted in historically low refining crack spreads during most of the first quarter. Our technology business delivered another quarter of outstanding results with continued improvements in licensing revenue that increased over both the prior quarter and the last 12 months. On Slide 6, you can see that LyondellBasell's businesses generated nearly $660 million of cash from operating activities during the first quarter. During the first quarter, we managed our debt portfolio by entering into a $2 billion term loan at favorable rates that was used to early refinance $1 billion of bonds that were due in April, 2019, which the balance used for general corporate purposes. Beyond our quarterly dividend, our strong cash flows provided ample capability to continue our investments in organic growth projects, while returning $512 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. The quarter closed with over $1.3 billion of cash and liquid investments on the balance sheet. Please turn to Slide 7. The chart on the left illustrates our cash flow performance over the previous four years and the trailing 12 months. During the last 12 months LyondellBasell generated more than $5.1 billion of cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures during the first quarter were nearly $600 million, with roughly 40% allocated to sustaining CapEx and the balance invested in profit generating projects. We expect that investment will slightly increase over the remainder of the year, as we complete the construction of our Hyperzone PE facility and accelerate the activity for building our PO/TBA plant in Houston. We believe that operating cash flow after accounting for sustaining capital expenditures provides visibility in our cash flow that is available for purposes such as dividends or accretive re-investments such as share repurchases, organic growth, or M&A. The chart on the right side of the slide illustrates our total liquidity for the same period, the decline in 2018 reflects the acquisition of A. Schulman. Liquidity improved during the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the new drawn and undrawn term loan facilities. We closed the quarter with total liquidity in excess of $8 billion. With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you very much. Bob Patel : Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 8 and review our business results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $516 million, $115 million lower than the fourth quarter. Results were driven by lower margins due to well-supplied markets for most products. Olefins results declined by $130 million compared to the fourth quarter 2018, driven by a decrease in ethylene price, but more than $40 per metric ton. Propylene prices also fell with the decline of more than $300 per metric ton. These price declines largely offset reductions in feedstock costs. Ethylene operating rates remained strong during the first quarter, averaging 93%, exceeding industry rates by 5%. We continue to optimize our cracker feature to benefit from lower NGL prices and found opportunities to capture discounts for un-purified [indiscernible] grade NGL feedstocks in our US Gulf Coast system. 83% of our ethylene production was from ethane and 93% came from NGLs. Polyolefins results decreased by $30 million during the first quarter. Margins declined in both polyethylene and polypropylene, partially offset by an increase in polypropylene sales volume. Polyethylene chain margins are showing signs of improvement in April, as feedstock price trends - prices trend lower and we enter the higher seasonal demand period. Now please turn to Slide 9 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $296 million, a $169 million increase over the fourth quarter, representing 133% improvement. Results were driven by increased volumes in all products and margin improvements for both ethylene and polyethylene. Market conditions improved with the strong recovery of polymer volumes following an unusually slow fourth quarter. Olefins results improved more than $95 million. Volume and margin increased, driven by the completion of planned maintenance in our cracker investment in Germany, partially offset by some unplanned maintenance across our system in the first quarter. Combined polyolefins results increased more than $55 million. Polyolefin sales have rebounded in the first quarter, with the volume improvement of 18% for polyethylene and 16% for polypropylene. Our polyethylene chain margins improved in the first quarter, as fixed and variable costs declined, due to the completion of maintenance. Joint venture equity income increased by $25 million. Industry polyethylene chain margins in Europe have remained stable in the first quarter at $560 per metric ton. A similar level to the average seen in the region for the full year 2018. We see potential for improved margins in the second quarter with early indications of ethylene and propylene prices outpacing feedstock price increases. Slide 10 reflects the recently updated views of industry consultants on global supply and demand balances for both ethylene and polyethylene. Recent ethylene demand growth has outpaced new capacity, resulting in very high effective operating rates, exceeding 95% over the past three years. We continue to believe that any reduction from these high operating rates during 2020 and 2021 will be relatively modest. The industry's recent experience with delayed in the new capacity should not be forgotten. And any future delays will only serve to further improve upon this forecast. Polyethylene supply and demand balance is shown in the chart on the right, illustrates similar constructive trends. The upturn in the global operating rates for 2019 provides optimism for a good market to start our new Hyperzone capacity, while typical delays in forecasted capacity, could reduce the impact of the most - of the modest downturn projected for 2020 to 2022. New industry capacity for both ethylene and polyethylene will create short-term fluctuations, particularly in local markets. However, global operating rates are forecasted to remain in the mid-to-low '90s, as illustrated by the shaded horizontal bands on the charts, where we believe markets are balanced to tight, providing good profitability for our advantage producers. Please turn to Slide 11. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $390 million, and a $11 million increase over the prior quarter. Results were driven by the balance in this business, as margins and volumes improved modestly. PO and derivatives results improved by nearly $30 million, volumes increased with completion of planned maintenance at our Bayport Texas facility in the fourth quarter. Intermediate chemicals results decreased close to $50 million, compared to the fourth quarter. Volumes declined for most products, margins decreased primarily for methanol and ethylene glycol, which was partially offset by margin improvements for styrene. Oxyfuels and related products results improved more than $15 million, as margins increased slightly due to lower butane feedstock prices. During April, European industry MTBE raw material margins have nearly doubled over level seen in the first quarter, and are exceeding the $225 per ton margins seen for the second quarter of 2018. This indication of constructive fuel markets coupled with low butane pricing provide support for earnings improvement moving into the second quarter. On Slide 12 I would like to highlight our Circular Steam Project, which is under construction at our Maasvlakte site in Rotterdam. In coordination with the Dutch government we are advancing on a sustainable project that contributes to the Dutch ambition of a 49% reduction in CO2 by 2030 through conserving energy and reducing costs. This project includes the construction of a new bio-based waste treatment plant an incinerator that deploys innovative technology to convert our water-based waste into energy. In short, the wastewater from our production unit will be separated into two streams. One stream will be sent to the bio plant for treatment to remove hydrocarbons, the recovered hydrocarbons then will be used as fuel for the incinerator. The second stream containing mostly caustic water will be sent to the incinerator where steam is produced and recycled back to our production units. The circular steam project will allow us to realize an annual reduction of 140,000 tons of CO2, which is equivalent to taking 31,000 cars off the road. Additionally, the project contributes annual energy savings of 0.9 peta joule which is equivalent to the annual electricity usage for 90,000 households. This project is not only a great step towards a more sustainable production process but also results in lower operating costs for our site. I look forward to providing you with updates as we make further progress on other sustainability programs. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the results of our advanced Polymer Solutions segment. First quarter EBITDA was $148 million, a $62 million increase over the prior quarter. Results were driven by seasonal margins and volume improvements as the market showed modest recovery from an unusually weak fourth quarter. Results also benefited from our increasing capture of A. Schulman synergies. As we discussed in the two prior earnings call, transaction and integration-related costs to the A. Schulman acquisition were $49 million during the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, integration costs were $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $16 million in the first quarter of 2019. All results depicted here include these transaction and integration costs. Compounding and Solutions results for the first quarter were more than $40 million higher than the prior period, driven by seasonal volume improvements and higher margins following a modest recovery for the week automotive market seen in the fourth quarter. Advanced polymers results improved by more than $5 million when compared with the prior periods. Our plans for the integration of A. Schulman are progressing very well and delivering results. As I mentioned earlier, at the end of the first quarter, we have already captured cost synergies at an annual rate of $85 million. When you consider our first quarter EBITDA and add back the integration costs. We are nearing our expected quarterly run rate for this segment plus synergies. We anticipate continued strength in the business as we enter the second quarter, which is a period of seasonally higher demand for most APS products. I'm very proud of our APS team and their hard work and continued focus on integration and synergy capture. On slide 14. I would like to highlight the Engineered Plastics business, that we acquired from A. Schulman is now part of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Engineered Plastics are similar to LyondellBasell polypropylene compounding products. But the compounds are made with different base resins such as nylon, styrenics, polybutylene or polyethylene terephthalate. The resulting polymer compound is developed mostly to replace metal and has high structural integrity and strength. It has low distortion and high heat resistance. There are multiple end markets for these plastics, including building and construction, automotive and recreational products. This slide shows two-end users for Engineered Plastics with which you may be familiar. [indiscernible] which is manufactured using our proprietary technology is a nylon compound used in the Duracell battery end cap assembly. This product helps to extend battery life and prevents battery fluid leakage. On the right you can see one of our styrenics alloy products that is used in manufacturing GPS domes used in John Deere farm equipment. The alloy provides improvements in UV stability and radio frequency transmission while reducing costs for our customers. Both of these products are sold to our customers in an easy to handle pellet form to facilitate manufacturing efficiency. Turning to slide 15. Let's discuss the results of our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was a negative $15 million, a $69 million improvement over the fourth quarter. Crude throughput at the refinery increased to 259,000 barrels per day following the completion of planned maintenance during the fourth quarter. Maya 2-1-1 crack spread reached historically low levels in January, but gradually improved and average more than $13 per barrel for the quarter. Unusually low discounts for heavy sour crude oil combined with high gasoline inventories created a challenging environment for our refining business during the first quarter. Fortunately refining markets corrected over the month of March and during April we continue to see substantial improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread. Slide 16, provides further detail of the refining spreads and shows the recovery in March and April. The price spread between Maya and Light Louisiana Sweet Crude has improved during the first quarter as shown by the dark blue portion of the bar chart. However, Maya pricing is still strong relative to other crudes due to the Maya pricing formula. Weak gasoline crack spreads in the fourth quarter persisted through February. The turquoise portion of the bar chart shows a significant improvement in gasoline crack spreads in March and April. As we enter the summer driving season we anticipate an improvement in the refining business through continued reliable operations and improved Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads. On slide 17, let me summarize this quarter's highlights. During the first quarter, we achieved earnings of $2.19 per share. Our O&P-EAI segment strongly rebounded from an unusually slow fourth quarter. Over the past 12 months our company generated more than $5.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed to funding for increased capital investment paying a top quartile dividend, completing over $2.2 billion in share repurchases and acquiring A. Schulman. Within two and 1.5 quarters of acquiring A. Schulman we've achieved more than half of our annualized synergy run rate target of $150 million for our APS segments. We're advancing construction of our PO/TBA facility and approaching the startup of our new Hyperzone polyethylene plant. We've continued to manage our portfolio through the acquisition of the same gas plant in La Porte, Texas and we're continuing to evaluate the Braskem opportunities. Going forward we see improvement in market sentiment with continued strong global demand. We expect most of our businesses to benefit from seasonal margin and volume improvements. Additionally as refining markets adapt to new marine fuel regulations will be ready to capture improved margins with our continued stable operations. Our global portfolio of businesses provides confidence in our capability to remain at advantage, resilient and poised to capture opportunities across a range of market environments. With all that said, we're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Don Campbell on for Bob. There kind of the 4Q earnings call you noted some improvement in the first few weeks in January. It sounds like you're seeing something similar with the first few weeks of April. Can you talk a little bit about what you've seen in terms of demand sequentially across the four months this year across January, February, March and April and how that sequential movement and demand has trended this year versus maybe last year or years before? Bob Patel : So we've continued to see demand grow sequentially in all of our products. I think what's been more noticeable is that because Q4 was so weak. We're seeing now the seasonal uptick in for example polyethylene and polypropylene globally. And that is more typical of the kind of demand we would expect at this time of year. And as I mentioned, in EAI the volumes are already back to levels that we saw in Q1 and Q2. So we're seeing very typical volumes, now that we're into the spring months. Unidentified Analyst : And then for polyethylene prices, I heard that April negotiations and then the May negotiations as well. It seems to be a little bit of a mix bag. Brent crude is up close to 40% year to date, but there is new supplier continuing to come online in the market. So I guess, what are your expectations for April and May negotiations? Bob Patel : Well, on the back of my earlier comment about volume improving, it would seem to me that, seasonally stronger period markets are to be much former. I think some industry consultants have pointed towards potential increases in Q2. And if you think about it, we're talking about flat to higher prices during a period when a historic build-out of new capacity is coming. And is already in the market, two thirds of it is really in the market already. And in my view, I think this is really the ultimate evidence that operating rates are quite high. And the new capacity is frankly coming online at a time when it\u2019s needed. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar: As oil prices rallied this year, NGL prices have declined, and the delta is good for you. But on the flip side, polyethylene prices are also kind of they are stalled, despite the oil rally. So can you give us your view on how do you see the margin progression happens where oil is, and your view on Slide 10 with supply demand? Bob Patel : Well, I think, first of all on the NGL side, you've seen NGL prices come off some, because the supplier has increased. And we've seen new pipelines come online from the Permian to Mont Belvieu for wide grade more fractionation capacity has come online. What's also really important PJ is that, the NGLs that are coming from the Permian now have more ethane, so there's less rejection. I think that all is a good setup for ethane. And with potentially modestly higher polyethylene prices through the Q2 and into Q3, we could see some margin expansion. I think pricing and margins have been stable, because there is new capacity coming, but it's coming at a time when it\u2019s needed. So it seems to me that we have a very well balanced market with some tightness in seasonally strong periods. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open. Steve Byrne : Like to hear your views on whether you'd wait for a 20-F filing by Braskem, before you move any further than that, but really more importantly, this compounding business that you've expanded. The EBITDA in that business was essentially half of the EBITDA in your Olefins and Polyolefins outside of the Americas. I would assume, just a fraction of the installed assets. Can you talk about what it will take to grow that business from here. Do you need to acquire more or can you organically grow into new products in new geographies? Bob Patel : So our first priority is to continue and complete our integration efforts with the A. Schulman acquisition. And as I highlighted in my prepared comments, we're making excellent progress and well ahead of schedule in terms of our integration effort. Once we have that platform established through the completion of the integration. I fully expect that we'll continue to evaluate other smaller inorganic opportunities. And along the way, especially in Asia, we'll likely have opportunities to build new plants as well. So I think we'll be able to do both, Steve, with respect to our APS segment. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Bhavesh Lodaya : This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Good morning. I would like to ask the demand question in a bit differently. After the de-stocking phase you saw in late 4Q and early 1Q, are we seeing the decent re-stock phase or our customers just running low inventories now. And also the volume growth we saw in the quarter, is there a way to separate both and I think the restock demand versus what you are seeing is core end market demand? Bob Patel : Yes, good question. I mean, I think this is always a bit elusive in terms of being definitive. But I can tell you directionally, my impression is that, given the macro backdrop of trade and Brexit and all these other things that create uncertainty. I continue to believe that buyers are really kind of buying what they need. I don't think we've seen a significant restocking that occurred year-to-date. The increase in volume, I interpret that as an increase in the underlying market and how the market is developing. Also as is well known, buyers are expecting more capacity to come online. So in a backdrop like that, unlikely they would aggressively restock. So I think these are very healthy signs of underlying demand being very good and growing year-over-year, as we come into the spring season and into the summer season. Restocking, let me just add one other thing. Restocking, I think we just add another layer of growth, if and when it occurs. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Bob, just on Braskem are we gaining some point we need to make decision in the next few months. And if the decision is no, is there a Plan B for M&A or capital allocation? Bob Patel : Well, first of all, I mean yes, it has been a rather lengthy period that we've been discussing with our counterparts. But David, on the other hand, it is a very complex transaction that has \u2013 it's multifaceted one of the facets was raised in a prior question. So we're working through it very methodically and thinking through value creation and weighing sort of the risk reward very carefully. And if we don't do it, we do evaluate, have a very robust pipeline of ideas that we can develop. But just to go back to what we said at Investor Day, two years ago, which was that, our priorities are to continue to pay a strong dividend that's progresses, buybacks will be in the mix and funded by operating cash flow. And when it comes to inorganic, we have return hurdles we want to meet and will \u2013 our return aspirations will be adjusted based on the risk that we see in the transaction. So I think, all things are open and we continue to think about how we can build a great company over the long-term. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Two questions around your Slide 10, which is the ethylene polyethylene supply demand. One, can you square Bob with your comment that two-thirds of the new capacity wave is already in the market. But yet on those charts, it looks like we peak in operating rates in 2019, and then move down each of the next three years? And then the second question would be, if we do move down in similar fashion to the way those charts are. What would your history and your gut tell you would happen to margins, if we left everything else equal, you know in natural gas, oil, all that stuff? Bob Patel : There is a lot there in that question, so let me unpack it a little bit at a time. First of all, on the two thirds my comment really related to the U.S. capacity that's coming online. And I think we would have \u2013 but the numbers suggest that we're kind of in the latter innings of this round of capacity additions. And in fact in some cases the derivatives are already online before the crackers are online. And so from a polyethylene impact standpoint, I think we've largely seen the impact of the new capacity. Referring to the charts, this is the latest IHS data. So we decided not to provide our interpretation through the graphs, but perhaps through the voice over here. So if you look at IHS they've added quite a bit of new Chinese capacity, Wood McKenzie have not. So had we included the Wood McKenzie forecasts it's actually quite different. No history would suggest that likely we are going to come out somewhere in between. As you know and as all the industry watchers know that typically new capacity if anything is delayed some of this is still haven\u2019t gone into FID yet especially in polyethylene. So I think we'll have to see, but what my takeaways are from these graphs is that even with a more robust a list of projects in Asia, you still see operating rates in the balance to zones still in the low to mid '90s. Any delays of a few units could flatten out the line more material delays could actually create an upward slope in the operating rate. So we're kind of right on the margin. And lastly, I would say if you think about the new capacity that's included now in the balances really most of the new additions are in the third and fourth quartile of the global cost curve. So they're not coming in advantage regions so I think to me all of that is a setup to say that we could have really very stable markets for a longer period of time. And if there are few delays or cancellations, you could actually see this operating rate graph turn up again. So I think we'll have to see, but our history globally in the industry has been that projects tend to get delayed and some still haven't reached FID yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Arun Viswanathan : I guess just a quick two part question. So first off stuff during the last quarter. And if you carry your statements out and just looking where we are on see margins you've seen a little bit of improvement in Europe, looks like the polymer side has increases recently. I know that North America folks have been trying to get a price increase in polyethylene for a little while. Your commentary sounds like it's potentially improving in terms of as we go restocking in Q2. My question is, I guess have you, do you feel that we've hit a bottom and polyethylene margins and you think we couldn't solely climb out of that and if so, how long would it take and maybe you can just include your thoughts again on the global capacity build out and I know it's obviously the upper end of the cost curve, but it seems like there's been recent additions of even more capacity in China. So maybe if you can just include that in your analysis that would be great? Bob Patel : Sure. Well, again, I mean I think as you look at the new capacity coming online this year, not only in the U.S. but globally. It's really meeting the new demand growth that we see year-over-year and I think the demand growth projections are still similar to what we've seen before. Q4 was just extremely weak as we, as we look back on and because of the de-stocking and some of the macro concerns. I think buyers really, really pulled back and, but we don't believe that the demand growth trends have changed materially. So my view is that I think two thirds or more of the new capacity is in the market as we go through the rest of the year, demand will grow to absorb the remaining capacity that's coming online. And yes, somewhere in here in the mid of this year, we should make a turn as there is less capacity coming in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is open. Hassan Ahmed : Not to bore you with sort of yet another question on Braskem but obviously, it's an important one. Look, obviously we saw business conditions turn very sour very quickly in Q4. Right? And you guys always talk about being sort of very prudent in thinking about M&A and the like. So my question is that, let's assume this draconian scenario that over the next couple of quarters maybe the business environment becomes like the Q4 '18 again. I mean in that scenario, we saw sequentially Braskem's EBITDA go down by as much as 50%. Now, if that was the base case would you guys still consider that acquisition as accretive and would the synergy is still sort of justify that acquisition at that run rate of EBITDA? Bob Patel : So I mean, first of all Hassan, it's a very good question. Hassan Ahmed : And I know I'm being draconian. Bob Patel : Yeah. I understand, but I think for us when we think about acquisitions of the size and magnitude of a Braskem. We've got to really take a longer-term view rather than one or two quarters. So, frankly speaking me what I would do is sit with my team and go through whether we think the business model has been altered or if there is some structural change in our view of the value creation from those assets. If there is, then we rethink it. But we don't, believe that to be the case. And so, I mean I think we just have to think through the reasons for this scenario that you described. And if its short-term versus long term. So that's kind of the deliberation we would go through. Hassan Ahmed : And I would also imagine the asset quality is very high right thinking about replacement value and the like? Bob Patel : Absolutely, and I\u2019ve mentioned this on previous calls that we've been through diligence and one outcome from the diligence was that we've confirmed that indeed the assets are of very good quality. So again, it's about thinking long term rather than medium to longer term as opposed to the next quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews : You did a nice job of laying out what's happened in the NGL markets and think in particular, but as we look into the back half of the year as the new ethylene capacity starts up in the U.S,. Now where do you think price gets back, do you to think we're talking high '20s, low '30s, where do you see the price in the medium term? Bob Patel : Vincent, it's hard to, sort of forecast a short-term run up in the price like we saw last year. But my sense is that as more of this ethane. So if you go back and dissect last year's spike, we'll call it that, there was actually less ethane coming down the Y-grade line from the Permian and other parts of West Texas down into Bellevue, that has now correct itself and there's a lot more ethane because there's new pipeline capacity, there are more fractionation capacity now, there is another one that's supposed to start up in the second quarter, incremental delays help propane and butane prices are very low right now and company like ours have also now validated our ability to crack Y-grade. So to summarize, first of all, I think there's plenty of ethane but if ethane prices were to rise because propane and butane are so abundant, I think they will quickly compete in terms of feedstock flexibility and now Y-grade will compete as well. So all of that should really allow the feedstock price to be relatively stable through the rest of this year and then next year there are six to eight new fracs coming in most of them are in the first half of the year and by our math is like almost 0.5 million barrels a day of new ethane coming to market in 2020. So I think there is a good base case here that says, we don't see a spike or any material sort of rising ethane price unless gas price changes or something. Operator : Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura. Your line is open. Matt Skowronski : This is Matt Skowronski on for Aleksey. PO and derivatives results were up quarter-over-quarter. Can you kind of talk about what you think about PO supply demand for the rest of the year and maybe 2020 as well? Bob Patel : Yes so, PO demand is still pretty good. We went through it a little bit of a soft spot in Q4 and there is some tied to automotive. So, but all of that seems to be recovering very nicely and we see our PO business being as solid as we've seen in years past, with modest year-over-year growth. I think given that you've asked this question, I think the more important driver in Q2 will be the TBA portion and the Oxyfuels. Because you know in Oxyfuels, we had - they did parallel to our refining business and that when gasoline values are low it impacts our Oxyfuels business as well. And so, gasoline recovering will help Oxyfuels values quite a lot. Blend premiums are up as well. On the cost side, butane is extremely cheap. So, we're seeing pretty meaningful upticks in Oxyfuel margins. So when I think about PO and derivatives together, the derivatives, especially Oxyfuels could provide pretty meaningful earnings improvement in Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Your line is open. John Roberts : Bob, you've taken a leadership role in plastics recycling. At the IHS conference last night, it seems without them, was I just misperceiving how it went last month? Bob Patel : Well, I - you are not misperceiving. I think they will join the broader movement. They already have initiatives in PET. And now it's just a matter of bringing it together under the umbrella of this alliance to end plastic waste. John, I think the key is collection of waste. And we start with the presumption that plastic waste has value. Then the highest priority is to collect it closest to the source, where the waste is generated. So it doesn't leak into the environment and we can reuse, recycle, recover the value that's in that plastic waste. And I think, those principles are universally applicable to all polymers. And we are really gaining momentum and on this alliance to end plastic waste. And you'll see more and more as the year progresses on tangible actions that the value chain are taking. Because ultimately, plastics are really a great sustainability story, the issue is dealing with the waste. And we're starting to see real solutions on how to deal with the waste. So I'm extremely encouraged and I think PET will join. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on the volatility we've seen in inventory levels of propylene monomer. Depending on when we start measuring, I guess have tripled from the bottom or doubled versus long term averages. And then we started to see some regression back down over the last six or seven weeks. So, could you comment on A, why they did they serge so high in late February or early March; and B, what is your outlook? Do you think that we've seen the peak and we come back down to more normal levels or has something changed there will be more durable or structural in nature? Bob Patel : Yes, Kevin. You know our VC3 inventories of propylene inventories, they are really related to how well the PDH is drawing in. We've had the large new PDH as that have been built, and have been running better as my impression. And when you couple that with the slower demand growth that we saw, especially early in Q1, in January and February. I mean, both of those things sort of went in opposite directions. So demand was slow, the big PDH has ran very well. I think ultimately also refining FCC units have some role to play in this. So FCC run well you get, more propylene as well. So propylene has been volatile for number of years now. And I think as these new PDHs run well and our part of the base load supply, we'll start to see these inventory swings moderate quite a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is the [indiscernible] William sitting in for Frank. Bob, I was wanted to follow up on the IND business. Obviously, you spoke very positively about MTBE into the second quarter. Last quarter you spoke about that business having a $1.7 billion EBITDA base case. Would you - would your comments be implying that, that we should start thinking about numbers north of that? Thomas Aebischer : Well, Frank. Let's see how the year plays out. But we've said 1.7 to 1.8could be kind of the new normal in terms of the run rate for IND. And I think we're very much in that zone. And with cheap butane prices as they are today. Again, I think it points to the abundance of NGLs. And that business in particular really benefits when global butane prices are lower. And today you're seeing butane trading around 50% of crude oil value which is on the low end of recent ranges. So let's see how things play out, but we think certainly the 1.7 to 1.8 range, as the base case is still in a very good range to consider. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Since the beginning of the year oil prices have gone from $50 a barrel to $70 a barrel. And the price of polyethylene in Asia and the export price in the United States, who really hasn't moved. Are you surprised by that and how do you diagnose that there's really been no change. Because normally those numbers really move together? Bob Patel : Right, Jeff. It's a very good question. And I think it's really a result of a couple of things. First of all, in Q1, we still had demand that was coming off of very low levels. And as I said earlier in one of the other questions, is that buyers still don't have conviction to build inventory, I think they're buying what they need. And so, so those two things probably led to this more sideways movement in polyethylene price. But again it's during a period when we're seeing kind of the later innings of this new capacity build out. I think that set up is not so bad. Actually, because it indicates that markets are still pretty resilient. And there were still decent margins in Asia, even after some rise in the naphtha price. So think we'll have to see how this develops in - and as we come into the seasonally strong periods of April, May, June. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard at Bernstein. Your line is open. Jonas Oxgaard : First of all I would like to thank you on behalf of humanity for first off going metric. And second for promoting waste incineration. Thank you. Bob Patel : Well, Jonas we are an international company. So we decided we better just go to metric tons across the board and global company. Jonas Oxgaard : You know, it could not have happened a decade early. The actual question though. Since the Asia polyethylene decided at the polypropylene floor now, which means polypropylene outlook becomes a lot more important. Do you have any views on where we can see Asia polypropylene going, both over the next year and if you think about the next five years or so? Bob Patel : Well, we're still seeing very good demand growth year-over-year. I mentioned in my earlier comments that even in the U.S., we've seen volumes improve very well. There are some signs of stimulus being added in the economy in China. For example the VAT cut that was implemented recently. Typically our impression is that these, these actions to provide stimulus in the economy. You see those maybe 90 to 120 days later. So we think those should bode well for polypropylene demand growth over the time - over the summer months and going into the full year. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay. And on the supply side? Bob Patel : Supply side. I mean, I think it's well known. I think overall polypropylene operating rates are still very good. Globally, even with some new capacity coming in Asia and particularly China this year. So we continue to be very constructive about polypropylene going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open. Matthew Blair : Looks like your refinery ran about 8% Venezuelan barrels approximately, just curious how you've been replacing those barrels this year, have you found any alternatives in South America are you running more Canadian or have you had to move to a lighter slate and run more U.S. shale? Bob Patel : No, I mean, we\u2019ve been able to buy some Colombian barrels and a little bit a few more barrels from other regions. And the challenge for us Matthew, in the refinery has been that the light-heavy differential is so leveraging to that refinery and we've had both sides of the equation go in the wrong direction frankly early on the sour side, we've seen reductions in supply from Venezuela, there is little bit less coming out of Mexico, OpEx cuts take out some of the sour crude and on the other side, the light crude LLS has come down, or has not gone up as much because there's a lot more supply coming out of the Permian, but I know you closely watch these things and you've seen that that differential is starting to open up again. As various market factors kind of normalized, so we think this is going to be a very important driver of earnings, the light-heavy differential normalizing in Q2 and Q3 and then while I'm talking about the refinery. I think IMO still in front of us, as we look at Q3 and Q4 and the new marine fuel has to be deployed in the system globally, so that would, there's compliant starting January 1 of 2020. So I think lot of these sort of extraneous factors are already starting to normalize benefit our refinery. Operator : Our last question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is open. Nick Cecero : This is Nick Cecero on for Laurence. So within the IND business more specifically ethylene glycol, it seems as though inventory levels in China had been climbing pretty rapidly for some time. So just wondering how quickly inventory work-downs can happen from current levels and then maybe just your view on supply demand dynamics over the next few years? Bob Patel : Well, I'm kind of ethylene glycol. There is also a seasonality to that business. Because some of that ends up in PDT and summer months more demand for more disposable goods a fewer products, if you will. So my sense is that the inventory will get worked off and the thing to really watch there is more about the pace of new supply compared to demand growth just like we look at fundamentals in the other businesses and we see reasonably good patterns ahead of us. I think when you - Nick, when you think about our IND business. The biggest drivers are going to be PO, MTBE, methanol and styrene. And so we really kind of focus on those as the big drivers for earnings while BDO and glycols are important and sort of the bigger levers are the ones that I just described. Thomas Aebischer : And with low cost ethylene in the United States. This is the best place to be producing ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol. So, that is helpful. But you're right, Nick prices have been very challenging this year. Operator : And we have no further questions. Bob Patel : All right, so let me close with a few closing thoughts. So you know as we look ahead to the balance of the year, as you've heard through my commentary and through our prepared remarks. We do see improvement in market sentiment continuing and supporting continued demand growth and more importantly tangible earnings growth. We see opportunities to grow our earnings through A. Schulman acquisition, our new polyethylene capacity that will come online later this year. The IND business some more pricing improvements that will come through as well as the Oxyfuels improvement that I mentioned earlier, refining margins we think are normalizing and most importantly, we're seeing that the light-heavy differential is opening up. So I mean I see in each segment of our business signs of sequential earnings growth as markets normalize and/or we implement our growth strategy. So with all that said, I look forward to giving you all an update at the end of our second quarter and give you a progress report on our growth projects as well. So with that, we'll conclude our call. Thank you very much for your interest. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

Following today\u2019s presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I'd now like to turn over the conference to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, Angela. Hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's second quarter 2019 teleconference.

The passcode for both numbers is 5713.During today's call, we will focus on the second quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and we will provide an update on our growth initiatives.With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Patel : Thanks, Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. During the second quarter, consumer-driven demand for our products and low feedstock costs improved profitability in four of our six segments. Despite concerns about capacity additions in the industry and a challenging business environment, integrated polyethylene profitability increased during the second quarter, with industry margins of approximately $600 per ton in Europe and $800 per ton in North America.Across the company, our second quarter EBITDA improved by approximately 11% relative to the first quarter. Second quarter earnings were $2.70 per share, which represents a 23% improvement over the previous quarter. Our second quarter income was slightly below the guidance range we've provided in June primarily due to compressed margins from our refining business. As the price of oil fell by more than 15% from mid-May to mid-June, we saw many of our customers holding back on June orders, particularly in markets that are driven by industrial demand such as automotive, appliances and industrial construction.During July, volumes for most products rebounded to levels 10% to 20% above June, and third quarter demand seems to be following typical summer seasonal strength. Our company moved forward on our disciplined value-driven growth strategy by announcing the second Spherizone polypropylene project at our joint venture in Thailand and ending discussions regarding the potential acquisition of Braskem.We are leveraging our innovative technologies by expanding our footprint in the growing Southeast Asian polypropylene market. We're completing construction on our first Hyperzone polyethylene plant and building a new propylene oxide plant that addresses growing demand for polyurethanes. These decisions demonstrate our disciplined approach to investments, which are focused on growth opportunities, where we see a clear path to value creation for our shareholders.Our strong cash flows and conservative balance sheet allowed us to launch a tender offer in June that resulted in the purchase of approximately 9.5% of our outstanding shares in July. Our actions in the last quarter are consistent with our balanced capital deployment strategy that positions us to grow cash flow and provide consistently strong shareholder returns in the form of both opportunistic share buybacks and a top decile dividend.Let's turn to Slide 4 and discuss our safety performance. Our approach to the integration of the A. Schulman acquisition began by immediately instilling LyondellBasell's safety culture across our new assets, employees and contractors.A. Schulman expanded our employee population by approximately 40%, and through the end of the second quarter, we achieved considerable progress to sustain LyondellBasell's leading safety performance.And now Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the second quarter. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to Slide 5, which illustrates developments within our company during the quarter and over the trailing 12 months. As Bob mentioned, during the second quarter, four of our six business segments posted higher profitability relative to the previous quarter.EBITDA for the entire company has continued to increase sequentially since the fourth quarter of 2018. Our business portfolio continues to provide earnings resilience through the diversity of our petrochemical products and markets and can often reduce volatility for the overall company performance.Integrated polyethylene margins have expanded in both Europe and North America due to favorable feedstock prices. In addition, seasonally low butane raw material prices drove benchmark Northwest Europe, MTBE, oxyfuels margins to the highest levels since 2015.In the first quarter, we mentioned that we had a minor impact due to the service disruptions related to the March fire at the third-party terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. The impact of lost sales volume and expenses extended to the second quarter, and we estimate that results for our I&D segment were impacted by approximately $50 million during the first half of 2019, primarily in our oxyfuels and related business.We anticipate that third quarter results will have little to no impact due to this issue at the terminal. Our Houston refinery continued to run well at 97% of nameplate capacity. Unfortunately high prices on the portion of heavy sulfur crude oil we buy on the open Houston market, reduced profitability relative to Maya 2-1-1 referenced crack spreads. Our technology business delivered another quarter of outstanding results with several licenses reaching revenue recognition milestones.On Slide 6, you can see that LyondellBasell's businesses generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operating activities during the second quarter. We raised the quarterly dividend to $1.05 per share in May, making this the 11 dividend increase over the past eight years. In addition to a strong dividend, our strong cash flows provided ample capability to continue our investments in organic growth project.We are progressing construction on our PO/TBA plant and wrapping up construction on our Hyperzone PE plant, where we will begin commissioning activities during the second half of the year. The quarter closed with over $1.9 billion of cash and liquid investments.Please turn to Slide 7, the chart on the left illustrates our cash flow performance over the previous four years and the trailing 12 months. We believe that operating cash flow after accounting for sustaining capital expenditures provides visibility into our cash that is available for accretive investments in organic growth and M&A or for shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases.During the last 12 months, LyondellBasell generated $4.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures during the second quarter were about $620 million with roughly 35% allocated to sustaining CapEx and the balance invested in profit-generating projects. This investment in growth has increased slightly during the second quarter, and we expect a similar trend over the remainder of the year as we complete the construction of our Hyperzone PE facility and accelerate the activity for building our new PO/TBA plant in Houston.The chart on the right of this slide illustrates our total liquidity for the same periods. The decline in 2018 reflects cash used for the acquisition of A. Schulman. As I've discussed in the first quarter earnings call, liquidity improved during the first quarter of this year primarily due to the new term loan facilities. We closed the quarter with total liquidity in excess of $8 billion.At the beginning of the third quarter, we utilized $3.1 billion of our available liquidity to fund the tender offer, which closed on July 12. The tender offer resulted in the repurchase of 35.1 million shares. With loan interest rates and LyondellBasell's strong dividend yield, our tender offer is cash flow positive.Cash savings from the quarterly dividends on the lower share count will exceed interest payment on the incremental bid. I would like to highlight the progress in reducing our effective tax rate for the quarter to slightly less than 15% and our cash tax rate for the year-to-date to slightly less than 12%. These rates are the result of many initiatives to optimize our tax planning with the largest benefits for this quarter rising from our success in obtaining incentives related to the company's targeted investments in research and development activity.At the beginning of 2019, we provided guidance to our effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 20% and that cash tax rates will be slightly lower. We now believe that our effective tax rate for 2019 will be approximately 17% and our cash tax rates will be several percentage points lower. Our fundamental approach to capital deployment remains disciplined and unchanged.Slide 8 is an illustration we have used to contrast the sources and uses of our capital in the past and going forward. We are first and foremost committed to a strong and progressive dividend. We will make capital investments that sustain and expand our asset footprint, pursue value-minded inorganic growth opportunities and return the balance of our cash through opportunistic share repurchases.With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Bhavesh Patel : Thanks, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 9 and review our business results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $635 million, $119 million higher than the first quarter. Results were driven by abundant and affordable natural gas liquids. Olefins results increased by approximately $90 million compared to the first quarter. This improvement was driven by a higher margin as declines in the cost of raw materials outpaced declines in the price of ethylene.Ethylene operating rates remained strong during the second quarter, averaging 91%, exceeding industry rates by 5%. We continue to optimize our cracker feedslate to benefit from lower NGL prices in our U.S. Gulf Coast system. We've previously spoke about how much of our ethylene production was produced from NGLs. It may be more useful to understand the composition of our feedslate.In the second quarter, we found advantage in low propane and butane prices. More than 25% of the raw materials used in North American crackers were propane- or butane-based and more than 55% was purely ethane. We continue to increase our utilization of mixed Y-grade NGLs as an advantaged ethylene feedstock. During the second quarter, mid single-digit percentages of our North American cracker feedslate was composed of Y-grade.Polyethylene results increased more than $25 million during the second quarter. Polyethylene margin improved with the spread increase in polyethylene over ethylene of about $65 per ton. Spot prices of ethylene have risen during July due to industry downtime and continued delays in the commissioning of new capacity. North American polyethylene production is increasingly serving global demand and more than one-third of U.S. and Canada industry production is now being exported.Slide 10, depicts historical and forecast impacts from capacity additions on global polyethylene operating rates. The green dash line illustrates consultants' forecast from 2016 for the impact of the current wave of new capacity coming into the industry. Some observers believed back then that this turnaround in operating rates \u2013 the downturn in operating rates would result in a period of compressed ethylene chain margins, similar to past cycles when effective operating rates tipped below 90%.However, delays in the start of planned capacity allowed robust global demand to absorb the new supply. As shown by the dark gray line, the industry maintained high operating rates and relatively strong integrated ethylene chain margins have endured. The forecast from 2016 proved to be far more bearish than the actual outcome.Similarly, current consultant forecast predicted the next wave of plant supply additions will lead to a small decline in global operating rates during 2022, illustrated by the gray dash line. Based on recent industry results, we expected that some of this planned capacity will also come online later than expected and some projects might be canceled.These delays and the reduction of planned capacity are likely to once again produce a flatter operating rate profile that extends today's relatively high rates for the years to come. New industry capacity will create short-term fluctuations, particularly in local markets, but we believe global markets will remain balanced to tight, providing good profitability for advantaged producers.Now please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, EBITDA was $331 million, a $35 million increase over the first quarter. Results were driven by continued seasonal improvement in polyethylene chain margins, with polyethylene price increases keeping pace with rising ethylene prices.Olefins results improved more than $55 million. Margin improved as the ethylene contract price increased nearly $65 per ton and volume increased with improved operating rates. Combined, polyolefins results declined $15 million primarily due to a decrease in volume. During July, we have seen strong polymer demand in the region as customers returned to the market after taking a pause during the second half of June with the hope of \u2013 for falling prices.Looking at our Olefins & Polyolefins from a global perspective, in both Europe and North America, polyethylene sales volume for July are projected at levels that are 15% to 20% above June. With six of our competitors', Western European crackers undergoing turnarounds during the third quarter, LyondellBasell will seek to catch our opportunities in the market.I'd now like to take a moment to highlight some of the products our customers are creating with recycled polyethylene and polypropylene that we produce at Quality Circular Polymers, QCP, our joint venture with SUEZ in the Netherlands.On Slide 12, you see our collaboration with Samsonite to create the first suitcase made using post-consumer recycled plastic waste. The outer shell is made from QCP post-consumer polypropylene resins and the inside fabric liner is made with PET from post-consumer bottles. We've also collaborated with Unilever to supply recycled plastic for Dove and Axe consumer product packaging.As the circular economy increases in prominence, we believe that demand for premium recycled materials will continue to grow. Our innovative joint venture with SUEZ harnesses each partner's strengths and deploys LyondellBasell's deep knowledge of polymer technology to convert plastic waste into new materials and products that are valued by consumers. We believe that mechanical recycling will become an essential component of LyondellBasell's sustainable business model.Please turn to Slide 13. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $448 million, a $58 million increase over the prior quarter. Results were driven by consistent performance of the I&D business portfolio bolstered by seasonally strong oxyfuels profitability.PO and derivatives results declined by $35 million, primarily due to decline in volume. Intermediate Chemical results improved more than $25 million compared to the first quarter driven by an increase in volume for most products.Oxyfuels & Related Products results improved by nearly $75 million as we saw strong seasonal margin increases driven by lower butane feedstock prices. As Thomas mentioned, our Oxyfuels & Related Products results would have been even stronger if not for the disruption of the Houston terminal fire. Fortunately, we expect oxyfuels margins to remain strong during the third quarter, and we anticipate little to no impact from the terminal incident on our business.Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $120 million, a $25 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. The seasonal strength that we anticipated for this business in the second quarter did not materialize. Results were lower due to diminished demand in both automotive and the industrial construction markets. A. Schulman integration costs for the second quarter were $19 million and impacted earnings by $0.04 per share.As we discussed in prior earnings calls, both transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition are included in the results for the third quarter 2018 and only integration costs are included in the fourth quarter 2018 through the current quarter. Compounding & Solutions results for the first quarter declined approximately $20 million driven by softness in the automotive market.Volume decreased for most products and margin declined for polypropylene compounds primarily due to a lag in propylene pricing. Advanced Polymers results were relatively unchanged. The second quarter is typically the strongest for this business due to the summer industrial construction market. That was not the case this quarter, and volumes were down by 15% compared to the same quarter last year.Our integration of A. Schulman is progressing very well. At the end of the second quarter, we are capturing cost synergies at an annual rate of approximately $100 million, and we are well on track to meet the target of $150 million before August of next year. We expect volumes to be fairly stable for the third quarter, with some potential for seasonal demand improvement.The return of typical demand for the automotive market will be slow, particularly in Asia, where 17 Chinese cities and provinces have accelerated the implementation of stricter automotive emission standards that has reduced demand for non-compliant models during July. Customer applications for APS products extend beyond automotive and construction to markets such as electronics and appliances, packaging and agriculture.On Slide 15, we highlight a specific type of polymer compound called anti-blocking masterbatches. Masterbatches are customized blends that can be mixed with commodity polymer resins during processing to improve both production efficiency and the properties of the finished product. Anti-blocking masterbatches are used in plastic films to reduce friction during processing and prevent a roll of film from sticking to itself prior to use or during use.An effective anti-blocking masterbatch streamlines the fabrication process and improves the usability of the film to minimize waste. By customizing properties to meet customer needs, our anti-blocking masterbatches serve a wider range of end products, including agricultural films, food packing and tape.Turning to Slide 16, let's discuss the results for our Refining segment. EBITDA for the second quarter was a negative $66 million, a $51 million decrease compared to the first quarter. We continue to demonstrate the benefits of our reliability program at the Houston refinery with crude throughput increasing to 261,000 barrels per day and operating rate at 97% of nameplate capacity for the quarter.The Maya 2-1-1 crack spread improved significantly in April and averaged approximately $19 per barrel for the second quarter. Unfortunately, we were not able to capture the full benefit of that crack spread improvement because our refinery does not source all of its crude oil on a Maya price basis. The heavy sour crude oil processed at our refinery are sourced from Mexico, Canada and other locations.High prices on the portion of heavy sour crude oil we buy on the open Houston market created a challenging market for our refining business during the second quarter. We continue to anticipate that margin benefit from the IMO 2020 regulations will bolster our refining results during September and October of this year.On Slide 17, let me summarize this quarter's highlights. During the second quarter, we achieved earnings of $2.70 per share. Low feedstock costs and resilient consumer demand for our products drove EBITDA improvement in four of our six segments, resulting in an overall EBITDA increase of 11% for the quarter. Over the past 12 months, our company generated $4.6 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed to funding for increased capital investment, paying a top decile dividend, completing $1.9 billion in share repurchases and acquiring A. Schulman.We move forward on our value-driven growth strategy by announcing the second Spherizone polypropylene project at our joint venture in Thailand, and we exhibited our disciplined approach by ending discussions regarding the potential acquisition of Braskem. We are advancing construction of our PO/TBA facility and will commission our new Hyperzone polyethylene plant during the second half of this year.Going forward, we expect that our business will continue to benefit from resilient consumer demand. In North America, low-cost NGL feedstocks should provide advantage for both our O&P and I&D segments.In our I&D segment, strong oxyfuels profitability should persist for the remainder of the summer driving season, with Northwest Europe benchmark margins reaching the highest level seen since 2015. Additionally, as refining markets adopt new marine fuel regulations, we will be ready to capture improve margins with high operating rates.Our global portfolio of businesses provides confidence in our ability to remain advantaged, resilient and poised to capture opportunities across a range of market environments.Before we open the line for your questions, I want to make you aware of our upcoming investor event. On Tuesday, September 24, we will hold our next Investor Day here in Houston, Texas. We are planning a full day event, with a plant tour of our channel view site as well as our Houston technology center. You will have the opportunity to talk with members of our executive leadership teams and learn more about our plans for the future. Please watch your e-mail for invitations or contact our Investor Relations team for further details.With that said, we are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Bhavesh Patel : Good morning. Arun Viswanathan : Just wanted to ask about the outlook for the rest of the year. You mentioned that July, you saw some improvement from the weakness in June. Conversely, polyethylene looks like there was some movement up in mid-June and then that kind of looks like it's going to recede in July, August. I mean that could be typical seasonality, too, but if you can just give us your thoughts on both the polyethylene as well as I&D and related to your earlier comments about July improvement. Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : So Arun, I mean we've continued to see the consumer demand driving demand for our products. Where we see a little bit more tepid buying is on the industrial side. As you know, there's a lot of concern about trade and tariffs and Brexit and the direction of interest rates. Our view is that that's all causing industrial sentiment or industrial buyers to be cautious in what they buy. Having said all that, we still see in the case of polyethylene, demand growth for this year of at least 4% year-over-year. And as new supply comes on, we think that the demand is there to meet it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, guys. A question just on your PO project. The polyurethane chain has been weak recently. When you look out, how does that impact your PO when it comes online? Do we need to see kind of an acceleration in growth in the polyurethane chain for that to be a healthy launch when that plant comes on? Can you just kind of walk through maybe how the economics look to you today versus when you pull the trigger on that plant? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Duffy. They haven't changed considerably. I mean it's really \u2013 what we're seeing today is a slowdown in the automotive market that we think is more temporary for a variety of reasons. Some are economic. Some are because of standards. For example, in Europe, diesel standards are changing and emission regulations are changing.So frankly speaking and I mean I think consumers in Europe don't know today what type of car they should buy, so they're just forgoing purchases until there's more clarity in the regulatory environment around emissions and so on.So our belief is that as the middle class grows in India, China and the rest of the world, and we think that automotive demand, although it's cyclical, longer-term, we believe that more automotive ownership and generally the middle class buying furniture and all the other things that polyurethanes go into really will underpin that investment. So our view has not changed in terms of our ability to price the product or to deliver the returns that we expect. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your lien is open. Dylan Campbell : Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. Earlier this year, you guys talked a little bit on I&D in terms of contract improvements, maybe adding $100 million of EBITDA starting essentially around now. Have you guys have any update on those contract improvements? Bhavesh Patel : I mean those are \u2013 Dylan, those are coming through our P&L now, and you see those in the results. And there's a lot of kind of moving parts in I&D, with styrene and methanol and so on. But I can tell you, we see it in our oxyfuels business and even more importantly, the advantaged butane especially here in the U.S. has been a really \u2013 a good positive driver for I&D earnings. So it is in the P&L. David Kinney : Dylan, this is Dave. I would remind you of Thomas' comments around the $50 million hit that we've taken in the first half of this year related to the ITC buyer. That's primarily been felt in that segment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : In the data that you've provided in the supplemental section of your release, it looks as though your polyethylene sales volumes declined 15% year-over-year in O&P-EAI. I know you mentioned June was soft and just wondered if you could elaborate on that. Was it due to the monthly sales patterns or did you have any operational or other issues that would explain that? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Kevin. Good morning. We did have some operational issues in one of our crackers, where we can't really buy ethylene to supplement. So that was most of that change in volume that you see, and some of that was just kind of managing our inventory. But most of it was unplanned maintenance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you very much, Bob. On the Hyperzone project, could you give us a little more definition on the timing of the startup and the ramp? And then also what's your view on the export markets pricing and sort of ability to move that volume? And then to which regions will you go? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So Vincent, we're going to start to \u2013 we're starting to get systems turned over to us now. We're not mechanically complete yet, but the commissioning process will really begin in earnest here in the coming month or two. And our idea is that we will have production in Q4 on the Hyperzone project.In terms export markets, the way to think about it is that we're going to export from the system on the Gulf Coast, so it's not that all of the product that comes out of Hyperzone will be exported. We'll export some also from other segments.Our early indications from what we did with customers in Europe and some in Asia was that indeed, the products that will come off of Hyperzone are expected to be unique and provide unique characteristics, for example, large-part blow molding. And so we have a very good, detailed marketing plan that includes all regions and aims to capitalize on the uniqueness of the products that come off of Hyperzone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Bob, with Braskem not happening, are you thinking perhaps ramping up ramping up your organic growth activities? And as part of that, can you discuss maybe your ethylene strategy going forward? You've been prudent not adding ethylene capacity, but you are an ethylene company, so you might \u2013 at some point I'm sure you will. Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Thank you, David. First of all, as we think about organic and inorganic, our capital allocation strategy is really geared around funding organic growth from operating cash flow. And so I wouldn't make a direct tie to not pursuing Braskem with increasing our organic programs. And we'll provide more of an update at the Investor Day. But our strategy around organic growth has not changed.After we complete PO/TBA, we potentially can do one or two more derivative one or two more derivative plants. I actually think that our organic growth program in terms of the funds require will scale down somewhat after PO/TBA. And we don't anticipate that changing. So I think we'll continue to strengthen balance sheet capacity for primarily in organic which as we demonstrated who quite patient. Operator : Thank you. Our next question come P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar: Quickly on \u2013 butane was your cheapest feedstock. I mean how much max butane can you go? And was there any benefit of lower butane in oxyfuels? And then you mentioned wider NGLs. How should we think about wider NGLs? The margins there would be your regular cracker margins plus captured in frac margins. Is that the way to think about it? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So first of all, your question on butane really we should think about propane and butane together. We can crack up to 40% - or 40% of our ethylene can come from propane and butane. 40% of our feedslate can be propane and butane. Yes, indeed, it did benefit our oxyfuels as well especially here in the U.S. So I think there was \u2013 again, it highlights our feedstock flexibility and our ability to be resilient in a range of energy price environments.In terms of Y-grade, we're continuing to increase our demonstration of our ability to crack Y-grade. So soon, we'll have demonstrated on four of our crackers on the Gulf Coast that we can crack Y-grade. So when ethane prices were a bit higher, Y-grade made a lot of sense for us. Today with where ethane is, ethane is far better from an economic perspective. So I think, P.J., the way to think about Y-grade is that it's one more lever in our ability to flex feedstocks to maximize value. And I think now we're very confident that we can do this at meaningful rates. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Bob. Bhavesh Patel : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Bob, just wanted to focus on near-term, compare and contrast relative to the back half of last year. It just seems that in the U.S. in particular, it's exactly the opposite. You have ethane, which is [indiscernible]. You have spot ethylene, which is topping. And like you said in your prepared remarks, the scale of 30% increment, not a 30% increment but 30% of the remaining capacity that was expected between 2016 and 2019 is yet to come. So what are you guys seeing on the ground? Bhavesh Patel : Okay. Well, there is a lot there, Hassan, so I'll kind of take it in pieces. First of all, when we think about the feedstock environment, you'll recall that even six months ago, we were concerned about another run in ethylene prices and that hasn't materialized. So why is that?Well, first of all, there's a lot of wet gas coming out of the Permian. There's been more pipeline capacity added, more fracs have been added. We've also had the turnaround season and project delays. So all of that has led to ethane prices falling below even, frankly, our expectations.I've had recent conversations with a couple of midstream company CEOs, and the impression I get is that there's a lot of ethane available that's going in the rejection now. It wouldn't take much of a price increase to bring that ethane out of rejection. So our view is that even with new cracker start-ups and turnaround season ending and so on, there's plenty of ethane. And we think that ethane price could perhaps return to recent levels before this latest decline, but we don't see a large runoff.On the polyethylene side, demand is still growing at reasonably good rates globally even with the backdrop of all of these concerns that are on peoples mind. So my sense is that I don't think inventories are terribly bloated. And some confidence returning to the market could boost the operating rates and the firmness in the market.Lastly, I think as you think through these new plants that start up, you have to remember that in our business, the supply comes on in a very lumpy fashion and demand grows over time. So generally, when I look at our business, I step back and look at quarterly operating rates and I look at annual operating rates.And that's why taking back to the chart that was in our presentation that annual operating rates are still very high, and I think that should be a good guide in terms of how we should think about profitability. So we're very constructive even in this environment where there's a good bit of uncertainty. I think if some of this uncertainty clears, confidence will come back to markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, Bob and good luck with getting that uncertainty cleared up anytime soon with Brent down 7% today. Hey, listen, I was interested in your thoughts on the Exxon Baytown accident, the unfortunate accident there and what the impact might be on the propylene business. And just in general, what your outlook is for propylene into polypro. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So Frank, certainly, the uncertainty will have to \u2013 it won't be solved overnight, and there will be, I suspect, more news flow on that. On the Exxon fire, first of all, I was really pleased that there were no significant injuries. That's the first thing that I look for when I see incidents like that, so I'm really pleased to see that. In terms of the impact on the propylene market, it could have a modest impact. I mean, I think we need to see how this plays out, but if you look at propylene prices, they've dropped a good bit compared to where they were a year ago.So to give you some round numbers, propylene was about $0.60 on average in Q3 last year, about $0.50 in Q4 last year, and we dropped down to $0.38 in Q1 this year and then $0.37 in Q2. So I cite all of that only to say that it seems that propylene prices are kind of \u2013 it seems they wouldn't go too much lower. And we'll have to see how this Exxon fire and their disruption impacts prices, but I would suspect there will be some modest impact. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Your line is open. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning, guys. Bhavesh Patel : Good morning. Jonas Oxgaard : I want to return to your comment around the demand has been growing well this year. I find it hard to square with Asia margins now being down to four-year lows even though we haven't added any real capacity in the last six months. So what am I missing here? Bhavesh Patel : Well, I think part of that, Jonas, is that new \u2013 well, new capacity is coming to the market over the last 12 months. And I think that buying patterns are more dynamic now than they were before because of the trade news and the tariffs and so on. But again, our perspective is that we're seeing growth in all three regions in polyolefins generally. So yes, I mean I think that this is just a reflection of oil price movements and buyers sort of anticipating the direction of prices. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay. Bob, what we've seen, though, is that demand has been declining in practically every petrochemical in Asia over the last six months. So why would polyethylene be the exception here? Bhavesh Patel : Well, our view is that that's because of the consumer \u2013 consumable nature of a lot of the end users. And our presumption has been that for the growing middle class, you have more consumption of those sorts of end users. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open. Luke Washer : Hi, good morning. This is actually Luke Washer on for Steve. I was wondering if you could give us some update on the progress you've made on your footprint and headcount consolidation at A. Schulman. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, our synergy run rate that we've captured thus far as of the end of Q2 were at about $100 million of synergy run rate. We've announced some closures of sites with \u2013 and we're working through our plans on that. And the restructuring on the business side is moving very swiftly. So we've made lots of progress.I won't get into specifics about each site, but generally, when we announced the transaction, we said that we would reach a run rate of synergies of $150 million per year about 18 months after the transaction was completed. We're not quite at 12 months, but we're about at the 12-month point this month and we're at a run rate of $100 million. So I think we're well on track. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Alex Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning. Your refinery has been running well recently, and you have \u2013 you lost money last quarter. Is there a structural disadvantage in crude purchasing? And how long do you think it will continue? And other investments you can make to overcome this disadvantage? Bhavesh Patel : So, on the refinery, I think you have to look at both sides of the equation, the crude side and the product side. So on the crude side, we do purchase Canadian crude by pipeline, so we processed about 25% of our crude slate in Q2 was Canadian crude.As we buy other like crude-by-rail or other sour crudes, those do tend to be higher priced than the pipeline crude. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the way you think about our crude slate is that we don't buy all on a Maya basis.And what we've had is a situation with Venezuela going out is that the supply of sour crude has shrunk, and with the Permian doing so well, the supply of light crude has increased, and that's what's caused this light-heavy differential to narrow.Just to give you some idea, that light-heavy differential was about $5 per barrel in July. It should be more like $8 to $10 per barrel. It's extremely leveraging. I think the other thing that probably is not on the investors' radar is that on the product side, because the propylene prices have declined so much, that's impacted profitability. I cited of some of those numbers.We've dropped from the $0.50 to $0.60 per pound range down into the high 30s, so that's had an impact. And lastly, at our refinery, our configuration is such that we don't convert naphtha into gasoline, but we don't have reformer. And with a lot of light crude processing in the industry, there's more naphtha available, which has impacted the price of naphtha. So I think all of this could normalize here with IMO approaching, as sour crude gets pushed back into the market and some of these product markets normalize. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open. John Roberts : Thank you. Bob, it seems like every earnings call has more discussion about sustainability and more of your efforts of recycling in new product. Do you have any overarching targets longer-term, say, five years, in terms of sales that you want to get to? Or any other metric you're using? Bhavesh Patel : No, we haven't stated targets nor will we. But the idea, John, is that we do see a business model here in terms of capturing the value that exists in plastic waste, and it's going to come through in a range of forms. So it's going to be mechanical recycling. We're also doing some research on chemical recycling. And I think this is going to be a growing area for us and one that will create value over time. We\u2019ve not set hard targets. As you know, we're a very sort of return-minded company. And as we think through investments, we think about the value-creation potential on each investment. But I do see this growing in our portfolio over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open. Matthew Blair : Good morning, Bob. Maybe just to circle back to refining, it looks like DOE data indicates that your Houston refinery is running perhaps a little bit more domestic crudes this year than the same point last year. It seems some other Gulf Coast refiners are lightening up their slate over the past few years. Is that an option that you're thinking about or considering? And if so, any thoughts on what kind of spending that would take? Bhavesh Patel : Good morning, Matthew. We have increased slightly our light crude processing. We can go up to about 10% in our light crude cracking. It would require a significant investment for us to increase the flexibility to do more than 10%, and our current plan is not to do that. So we think, again, that with IMO 2020 around the corner here, we think that some of these markets are going to normalize and move in favor of the configuration of our Houston refinery. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, we are ready to meet those specifications, and we've completed really all of our turnaround activities. So we're prepared to run at full rates through 2020. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Bob, another question on recycling. First of all, your efforts here are commendable and your QCP products that you showed look quite look. And you also have this other alliance with chemical companies and some customers about ending plastic waste. So if you take a step back and look at how recycling is playing out, how would it impact virgin plastics demand? And then maybe in recycling, could you potentially get higher margins if customers want these products? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So as you have several questions there and it's a very big topic for us, so I'll start with your last question, which is how customers perceive recycled product. Many of the consumer brands have announced targets of how much recycled content they will have in their packaging, so I do see demand for recycled \u2013 high-quality recycled resins increasing.And I think what's unique about our joint venture with SUEZ is that it really combines the strength of both of the companies. So in the case of SUEZ, their waste collection infrastructure, sorting infrastructure brings to our joint venture segregated polyolefin waste, which enables high-quality recycled products. And then when you combine that with our technological know-how around polyolefins, you can see from those couple of examples that we've really created some unique and high-quality recycled products.I think the degree to which recycled products impact virgin resin demand growth, that's something that we'll have to monitor as recycling ramps up. One of the challenges, as many of you know, is that recycling in the past has been difficult because mixed waste is the challenge and sorting has been prohibited from an economic perspective. So if the waste is very mixed coming in, then the recycled product is of very poor quality. I think that's the thing that we've been able to solve at QCP.So I think it's something we'll have to monitor. Let me say a couple of words about The Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which you also asked about. So you'll recall that we launched this alliance at the beginning of this year in January. We've increased our membership now by 14 more companies in the last couple of months to 39 companies across the value chain.So we have brand owners, we have chemical companies, we have waste handlers, and we have converters, and we're seeking to add retailers as well. I think what's really great is that this \u2013 we all have rallied around the thought that plastic waste has value. It's now about how do we create infrastructure and systems to collect the waste? How do we innovate so that we can use the waste and convert it to recycled products that can be reused? How do we educate consumers on how to responsibly dispose of waste so that the value can be captured?And ultimately, the alliance will also aim to fund projects that remove waste from the environment. So we're making great progress. We had a great board meeting in July, and the momentum continues to build around The Alliance to End Plastic Waste. So thanks for that question. Okay. Bhavesh Patel : So if there are no other questions, then let me offer a few closing remarks. First of all, the combination of our advantaged assets and consumer-driven demand for our products is generating resilient performance during somewhat uncertain times in terms of industrial demand. You can see from our quarterly results that with the portfolio of businesses that we have and our organic and inorganic growth, we're able to continue to provide strong earnings in a range of environments. I mentioned during my prepared remarks as well as during the Q&A that we continue to invest in feedstock flexibility. I think that we'll continue to strengthen our ability to do well in a range of energy and feedstock price environments.And lastly, we talked a lot about capital allocation and our disciplined approach to capital allocation. You should continue to expect that we will focus on a strong and growing dividend over time. Our organic growth program will be modest and very disciplined. I expect that our CapEx will probably come down after the PO/TBA project is completed. And our aim ultimately is to deliver strong and consistent value for you, our shareholders.So with all of that said, thank you for your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you on the third quarter earnings call. In the meantime, we hope to see many of you at our Investor Day. Thank you and have a great weekend. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today\u2019s presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, Britney. Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell third quarter 2019 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today we will be discussing our business results while making references to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with other disclosures including the earnings release are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 :00 p.m. Eastern time today until 11 :59 p.m. Eastern time on December 1 by calling 888-568-0509 in the United States and 203-369-3479 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 5713. During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thanks, Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide 3 and review the third quarter highlights. During our Investor Day in September, we emphasized how our leading and advantaged portfolio of businesses is poised to deliver resilient performance and strong cash flows across a range of market conditions. The company delivered on this commitment during the third quarter with $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities. Our third quarter EBITDA of $1.5 billion represents a decline of approximately 4% relative to the second quarter and 13% relative to the prior year. Third quarter earnings were $2.85 per share, which represents a 6% improvement over the previous quarter. This is our third consecutive quarter of increasing earnings per share. The advantage of abundant low-cost natural gas liquid feed stocks continue to benefit our North American businesses. Demand for our consumer-driven non-durable products reflected typical seasonal strength with a 5% increase in our global polyethylene and polypropylene sales volume relative to the second quarter. Industrial driven markets for durable products saw weaker margins and demand due to trade uncertainty. Despite the challenging market conditions, our portfolio of businesses performed well during the quarter continued to efficiently deliver outstanding cash flow. Let's turn to slide 4 and review our approach to maximizing the returns from this cash generation. We have followed a consistent and disciplined capital allocation strategy that provides a sustainable balance between value-driven growth and strong shareholder returns. Our growth investments in new capacity are underway with our Hyperzone polyethylene capacity being commissioned as we speak. We now expect sales volumes to ramp up during the first quarter of 2020 with increasing profitability throughout the year. Cost for the project is estimated at approximately $900 million. This project continues to be very attractive due to our advantaged feedstock position in North America and the differentiated technology, which will deliver new high-performing products to our customers. During our recent Investor Day, many of you toured the construction of our new propylene oxide plant that is being built across two sites outside of Houston, in Channelview and Bayport. We continue to expect this plant will be completed in the second half of 2021 and further increase our cash generation during 2022. The box on the right of the slide illustrates our progress on additional value-driven opportunities. In late September, we extended our long-term relationship with Enterprise as the anchor customer for their second propane dehydrogenation plant that will start in 2023. This contract provides LyondellBasell with additional propylene supply at cost-based economics to support our downstream capacity growth in propylene oxide. Earlier in September, we announced a memorandum of understanding with Liaoning Bora Group to form a joint venture that will rapidly expand our global olefins and polyolefins network in China. The project provides LyondellBasell with the local production presence in a market that is growing at more than twice the rate of global GDP. This project is more than 50% complete and expected to begin operations in 2021. Finally, we completed a tender offer in July that resulted in the repurchase of approximately 9.5% of our outstanding shares for $3.1 billion. These actions demonstrate our discipline and commitment to balancing growth with substantial returns to our shareholders. Let's turn to slide 5 and discuss our safety results. Our emphasis on operating safely is embedded in our culture. It is never taken for granted. We realize that we need to work every day to cultivate processes and behaviors that support leading safety performance for our employees, contractors, our communities and our business partners. We will continue to maintain a consistent focus on safety, as we believe it underpins everything that we do. Let's turn to slide 6 where we highlight LyondellBasell's activities in advancing our sustainability agenda. During the same week as our Investor Day in September, we published our second annual sustainability report. This report is on our website and it describes our goals and progress over the prior year. Our company is also developing innovative business models that advance the circular economy. In addition to our PE and PP mechanical recycling business and usage of bio-based feedstocks to produce new plastics, last month we announced the construction of a new pilot facility in Italy for our MoReTec molecular recycling technology. We are moving forward with these three business models to increase circularity and develop sustainable and profitable business platforms within the next decade. It's important to remember that plastics provide many benefits to society and will continue to do so in the future. However, we must address the issue of plastic waste. We have committed to pursue zero loss of plastic pallets from our production facilities and we are leading meaningful solutions to eliminate the leakage of plastic into the environment through the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Additionally, our company is targeting a 15% reduction in carbon dioxide emission intensity by 2030. We hope that you as our investors and stakeholders will take time to review our sustainability report and provide us with your feedback on our progress. And now, Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the third quarter. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to slide 7 where you can see the growth of our earnings over the past three quarters. As Bob mentioned, third quarter earnings of $2.85 per share were supported by strong consumer driven seasonal demand for our products as well as our sizable share repurchases. Third quarter results included an $85 million non-cash benefit from the settlement of prior tax year positions that increased earnings by $0.25 per share. Integration costs during the third quarter related to the Schulman acquisition impacted net income by $33 million or $0.10 per share. During the third quarter, we repurchased 37 million shares. Now let's look more closely at our consistent and efficient cash flow performance on slide 8. Our businesses have generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities over each of the prior four calendar years and $5 billion over the trailing 12 months. With $1.1 billion required for sustaining capital expenditures, our free operating cash flow yield was 13.2% over the past 12 months. Slide 9 describes our cash flow generation and deployment during a very active third quarter for our finance department. Cash flow from operating activities effectively doubled our starting balance of $1.9 billion. Debt increased by net $1.7 billion, during the third quarter. While the timing of the increase debt aligns with our July tender offer, you will recall that we invested approximately $1.9 billion of cash on hand in acquiring A. Schulman last year. During the third quarter, we issued $1 billion in Eurobonds, in two tranches and used the proceeds to repay a term loan and a portion of our short-term debt. The coupon rates for the notes were the lowest in our company's history, 0.875% and 1.625% for seven- and 12-year terms respectively. Near the end of September, we priced $1 billion in 30-year dollar notes, that's held in October. The 4.2% coupon rate for these notes is also the lowest in company history for U.S. bonds of this tenure. We used these proceeds to repay short-term debt. During the third quarter, as mentioned before, we repurchased 37 million shares and in addition, paid dividend, returning a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders. Capital expenditure for the third quarter were approximately $740 million with roughly 60% invested in profit generating growth projects, with the remainder allocated to sustaining capital. Our investment in growth has increased in second quarter. And we expect a similar trend over the remainder of the year, as we complete our Hyperzone PE plant and accelerate the activity on construction for our new PO/TBA plant in Houston. The quarter closed with approximately $1.1 billion of cash and liquid investments. Slide 10, illustrates the maturities of our long-term debt, after the October issuance. The two recent bond offerings reduced our weighted average cost of debt, by 42 basis points. We have a well balanced maturity profile that reduces refinancing, risks and enables the company to benefit from a consistent presence in both, U.S. and euro fixed income markets. Let's turn to slide 11 and review our disciplined approach to capital deployment that we discussed in detail during our Investor Day. The principal for our capital allocation strategy have remained consistent. Our businesses generate tremendous cash flows. We are first and foremost committed to a strong and progressive dividend. We will make capital investments that sustain our manufacturing reliability. And expand our asset footprint. We will pursue value-minded inorganic growth opportunities. And return the surplus cash to share repurchases. All of these decisions points are underpinned by our commitment, to the flexibility provided by our strong investment-grade credit ratings. With that, thank you very much. And I will turn the call back to, Bob. Thank you. Bob Patel : Thank you, Thomas. As many of you know, Thomas will be retiring from the company in the coming weeks. I want to take this opportunity to thank Thomas for his hard work over the past four years to build and enhance our finance organization. These contributions to the development of our growth strategy, and his leadership in standardizing several of our processes, I wish Thomas and his family all the best. I particularly wanted to thank Thomas for agreeing to help us manage a thoughtful transition for a successor Michael McMurray, who will join the company as an Executive Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer next Tuesday, November 5. Michael joins us after serving as CFO for Owens Corning, in a career that spanned more than 30 years in various finance, treasury and investor relations roles, for Owens Corning and Royal Dutch Shell. I hope you will all join me in warmly welcoming Michael to LyondellBasell. Now let's turn to slide 12 and review our third quarter EBITDA performance. Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio, continued to demonstrate strength and resiliency in a challenging market environment. EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.5 billion. Profitability, for integrated polyethylene production remains strong in both the Americas and Europe with, industry benchmark chain margins of approximately $700 and $600 per ton respectively during the third quarter. During the quarter, we maintained high crude processing rates at our Houston refinery and benefited from improved margins relative to the second quarter. Several of our intermediate chemicals businesses, mainly styrene suffered from weak margins due to lackluster industrial demand in a well-supplied market. Let's begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on slide 13. Third quarter EBITDA was $653 million, $18 million higher than the second quarter. Profitability was driven by robust global demand and our capability to capture the benefits of abundant and affordable natural gas liquids, through our feedstock optimization. Olefins results increased by $120 million compared to the second quarter. Margins expanded on higher ethylene sales prices and lower feedstock costs. Ethylene operating rates fell to 80% due to a planned maintenance turnaround that we completed at our Clinton, Iowa facility during the third quarter. As propane and butane prices fell by nearly 20% in the third quarter, we captured value from the high feedstock flexibility across our fleet of six U.S. ethylene crackers. We increased utilization of propane and butane feedstocks by nearly 10 percentage points to 35% in the third quarter. Polyolefin results decreased by about $100 million during the third quarter, Polyethylene spread over ethylene price declined by about $220 per ton, partly due to higher ethylene costs and declining polymer prices. Polyolefin volumes increased due to an increase in polyethylene exports. We expect the fourth quarter will follow typical seasonal trends, with reduced demand as customers take holiday downtime. And seek to minimize year-end inventories. With approximately 80% of the new U.S. polyethylene capacity now in the market, this is an opportune time to review the impact of new capacity and polyethylene pricing. Slide 14, illustrates quarterly contract price change, for the North American polyethylene industry, over the past five years. The green bars indicate increases, orange bars represent decreases. The amplitude and volatility of price changes during the 2018 and 2019 have been relatively moderate when compared to the prior four years. In fact, the net reported price change over the first three quarters of 2019 has been zero. Industry statistics indicate that days of sales in inventory, fell in September, with export sales now representing 35% of production. Increasing exports, decreasing inventories and muted pricing responses, all imply that the new capacity is meeting demand in the global market. Our view is that, the new capacity will create short-term fluctuations particularly in local markets. However, we believe the new capacity is ultimately needed and global polyethylene markets will remain relatively balanced, providing good profitability for advantaged producers such as LyondellBasell. Now please turn to slide 15 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $291 million, a $40 million decrease compared to the second quarter. Underlying business results, were impacted by lower polyethylene chain margins, but supported by healthy polyolefins demand. Olefins results decreased by about $10 million due to a small decline in volume, combined polyolefins results were comparable to the previous quarter. Polyethylene volume increased 10% over the second quarter, with customers returning to the market, after taking a pause during the second half of June. Polyethylene margins declined offsetting the improvement in volume. Modest reductions in margins across our joint ventures contributed to a decline in equity income of approximately $15 million. We expect the fourth quarter to follow the same seasonal trend, as the Americas with reductions in year-end demand. Please turn to slide 16. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $390 million, a $58 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Results were affected by a decline in margins, due to a well-supplied market for our intermediate Chemicals business, but bolstered by seasonally strong Oxyfuels profitability. Intermediate Chemicals results decreased by $95 million compared to the second quarter, driven by a margin decline in all businesses, primarily styrene. We began planned maintenance at our Acetyls plant in La Porte in the third quarter, which will reduce volumes for both the third and fourth quarter. Oxyfuels & Related Products results improved nearly $30 million as we saw margin increases driven by higher gasoline blend premium and lower butane feedstock prices. During October, oxyfuels margins have declined with weaker gasoline demand as the summer driving season ends. We expect typical fourth quarter seasonal declines for the segment and continued pressure from a well supplied market. Now please turn to slide 17 to review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $102 million, an $18 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Results were impacted by increased integration costs and continued headwinds in the automotive sector partially offset by a modest improvement in construction demand. Included in the results were $43 million of integration costs for the third quarter, which impacted earnings by $0.10 per share. Compounding & Solutions results were relatively unchanged due to the softness in the automotive market. Advanced Polymers results increased by $10 million. Third quarter performance was supported by improved seasonal demand from the roofing market. Our team is making continued progress on the integration efforts. In fact, we increased our two-year cost synergy target by $50 million to a total of $200 million. At the end of the third quarter, we are capturing cost synergies at a forward annual run rate of approximately $125 million. We expect profitability for the segment to follow normal seasonal trends. Trade uncertainty and labor disruptions continue to affect the automotive industry and our business is likely to continue following the general sentiment for that market. Turning to slide 18. Let's discuss the result for our Refining segment. EBITDA improved by $60 million over the second quarter to negative $6 million for the third quarter. We continue to demonstrate the benefits of our reliability program at the Houston refinery with crude throughput increasing to 264,000 barrels per day operating at 99% of nameplate capacity for the quarter. Our Houston refinery processes heavy sour crude oils from Mexico, Canada and other locations. In the third quarter, refinery margins benefited from improved diesel spreads and stronger discounts for the portion of heavy sour crude oil we purchased on the open market in Houston. The U.S. refining market has been challenged by global disruptions in the supply of heavy sour crude oil resulting in a string of quarterly losses in our Refining segment. During September, profitability was further impacted by unusual increases in the formula pricing from higher crude from Mexico. These pricing decisions have spurred us to pursue increased utilization of alternative crude oils for the long-term supply of our refining business. As the implementation of the IMO 2020 marine fuel regulation inches closer, we expect continued margin improvement in our refining results during the fourth quarter. We are well positioned to take advantage of this regulatory change by converting high sulfur crude oils into more environmentally friendly marine fuels. Please turn to slide 19 as we review the results of our technology segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $83 million, a decrease of $24 million compared to the previous quarter. The business model for our technology segment is based upon the licensing of polymer production technologies and catalyst sales. Individual contract terms and the timing of project milestones drives the pace of licensing revenues for the business. In the third quarter, we had fewer licensing milestones than the prior quarter, which resulted in reduced EBITDA. Catalyst sales volumes and licensing activity are projected to be strong during the fourth quarter. On slide 20, let me summarize this quarter's results. During the quarter, we increased our earnings to $2.85 per share. Our profitability remained strong and generated cash from operating activities of $1.9 billion. Our company is delivering resilient performance in a challenging market where trade uncertainty and lack of confidence in the industrial sector has reduced demand for many of our products. The long-awaited polyethylene cycle is now upon us with approximately 80% of the U.S. capacity now online. Polyethylene spreads over naphtha in Asia are approaching 10-year lows. With inventories largely destocked any improvement in industrial confidence is likely to reverse these trends and trigger restocking that should tighten markets and increase margins. In addition to the market improvements, LyondellBasell has tangible sources of cash flow growth that are independent of market sentiment. During October, the looming implementation of the IMO 2020 marine fuel regulation drove favorable crude oil differentials and higher diesel spreads that improved profitability for our business in October. We will increase our polyethylene capacity and reduce our CapEx over the next year with the completion of our new Hyperzone plant. With higher earnings and lower capital spending, we expect additional cash flow to provide further support for our secure dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. We continue to advance our growth objectives by pursuing a new partnership in China and a propylene supply agreement with Enterprise. In short, we're leveraging our leading portfolio in advantaged positions to support disciplined investments that should deliver sustainable value for our investors. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open. Duffy Fischer : Yeah. Good morning, guys. Bhavesh Patel : Good morning. Duffy Fischer : First question is just if you look at a number of the major consultants in the space, they would have integrated polyethylene margins coming down kind of throughout or all the way through 2020. Obviously, you get their data and kind of analyze it. Where do you think they're getting it wrong? What are they too punitive on that they would be more negative than your outlook for polyethylene? Bhavesh Patel : Well Duffy first of all, if you consider the market environment today and if you look at prior downturns, on the demand side, we already have a lot of uncertainty that's impact demand. You think about the auto sector, trade uncertainty, recession fears, Brexit and so on those have all weighed on demand all year long and we've seen destocking. So we think on the demand side, we've already seen somewhat of a downturn. And to your question about what they might be missing. If you -- I would point to the Asia PE to naptha spread. It's approaching $300 per ton. And if you look over the last 10 years that's reaching the lows over that period of time. And it seems to me that that's pointing towards a trough in polyethylene margins. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Bob, a couple of questions on the refinery. You referenced IMO 2020. Can you talk through the expected impact of that event? Does it influence the way that you're running your asset in terms of catalyst slates mix of products and how did the unit run in October please? Bhavesh Patel : So the unit ran very well in October. And if you'll recall from our prior conversations, the impact from IMO comes in several forms for us. One is that we'll benefit from a wider light-heavy differential meaning that sour crudes will see less demand as not all refineries are able to meet the new specifications. We should also see wider distillate spreads -- diesel spreads. We're already seeing that -- some of that and October. So to give you some points of reference, the September Maya 2-1-1 was about $14.60. The October average is now $21.30. So we've seen approximately $6.50 improvement in the Maya 2-1-1 from September to October. We think that as we go into next year, we have significant leverage to that improvement toward the widening of the light-heavy differential. In terms of our refineries positioning, you'll also recall that we've completed all of our turnaround work. So next year, we do not have any major turnaround activity in our refinery. So we're prepared to run at full rates next year and we're doing our best to buy the most competitive crude oils that suit our refinery and we're going to continue to focus on that. So, I think we're really well-positioned and we think about the volume leverage at 950 million barrels per year that we process. Thomas Aebischer : 95. Bob Patel : 95. Sorry 95 million barrels per year that we process. So every dollar has a pretty significant impact over a year when you multiply it by the 95 million barrels. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Bob, just on Hyperzone. Can you discuss whether the expected EBITDA contribution remains the same? How are you going to seed your volumes? Who are you -- how is that progress progressing? And did the cost at the end increase for the project? Thank you. Bob Patel : Yeah. So, about cost and schedule first, David. So on cost, yes, it did increase. We're showing about a $900 million sort of CapEx number at this point. Still very competitive compared to bills that have occurred recently. In fact, I would say still better than market average from what we can tell. Schedule-wise, we're commissioning now various parts of the plant, and we expect to move into production very late in the year or early next year. In terms of the EBITDA contribution, it'll ramp up through next year as we demonstrate the production and start to demonstrate the types of products that that plant can make it. What's very typical of new starts is that you have some ups and downs early on to make some off spec while you're trying to prove out the technology. And certainly by the back half of the year, we ought to be producing many of the products that we had envisioned that this differentiated technology will produce. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. P.J. Juvekar: Can you talk a little bit about your feedstock slate on the Gulf Coast? You mentioned ramping up propane and butane feeds. One of your competitors went to zero naphtha. So, with your propylene deal with Enterprise, can you go even more lighter? Can you just talk about your feedstock slate and how do you see that evolving? Bob Patel : Well, P.J. first of all, in our feedstock consideration, so far the amount of propylene we produced hasn't really driven the feedstock decision. It's more about the relative price and relative economics. Perhaps the price of propylene has more impact than the amount of volume we output, because we have our flex unit where we can also convert ethylene to propylene, if we needed more propylene and it made economic sense. As I mentioned earlier, we increased butane and propane cracking up to 35%. And I think we could perhaps stress that a little bit more. And the key point on feedstock flexibility is that with our ability to crack that much of LPG and more Y-grade, if this Y-grade becomes the economical, I think we have the full range of feedstock available to us to capitalize on whatever feedstock environment presents itself. We still see ethane as being really well supplied and well priced to maintain the U.S. advantage when you think about a global cost curve. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Bob Koort : Thank you. Bob, I just wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation, in particular reinvestment in LyondellBasell versus potential inorganic targets. I guess since the summer, we've seen a pretty good rally in some of these cyclical names at least in valuation levels as well as your own frankly. But can you just talk about the tension between how you think about M&A, and maybe the short-term fluctuations and valuations and long-term value? And then, maybe you could also speak to the Schulman integration costs and what that cadence looks like going forward. Thanks. Bob Patel : So, Bob first of all on M&A, there are a few principles that we really hold to. One is that we're committed to a very strong investment grade rating through the cycle, minimum BBB rating post any transaction that we might consider is very important to us to have the flexibility and the strength in terms of our balance sheet. Secondly, must have strategic fit and we're going to be very value-oriented, patient and disciplined. And I think we've demonstrated all of those things through our decisions on what we have done and what we haven't done. To your point about the tension between acquiring ourselves and acquiring perhaps others, the way think about this is that for the use of our operating cash flow, first and foremost, we're committed to the strong secure and progressive dividend over time. And as we demonstrated at Investor Day, it's really well covered. Sustaining CapEx by $1.1 billion, organic growth will be declining, so we think we'll have excess cash flow to dedicate to opportunistic buybacks as we progress over the next 12 to 18 months. As far as using our balance sheet, likely we would not use that for buybacks. We would consider more of that for very value oriented M&A. So look for us to stay disciplined, stay close to our core and constantly solve for a strong investment grade rating. And your question about Schulman integration, the integration costs will ramp up further, and Thomas, I don't know if you wanted to comment on how much will flow through 2020. Thomas Aebischer : Right. So we -- thank you, Bob. So we -- you have seen the integration costs for the third quarter where we are now at $43 million, so we made further progress in accelerating the integration of Schulman off the tax $33 million. And so we are at the -- we will go live with a large part of the SAP integration of Schulman into LyondellBasell in the first half of 2020 and that's actually where integration costs will peak. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Bob, just another question on the refinery, and I guess my question is, as you've obviously improved the reliability of it. And now there's opportunity for a structural change in its margins or earnings power. How core to LyondellBasell is the refinery and would you consider monetizing it? Bob Patel : Thanks for your question, Vincent. Well, as I've said in the past, I mean our focus has been to improve reliability and control the controllables, if you will, which is run the asset really well. And I'm really proud of the team at the refinery. I think they've delivered really great performance. We wanted to position ourselves for IMO 2020. I think we've done that completing our turnaround work, so we have a clear runway for next year to operate at maximum capacity. The key focus Vincent, at the moment is, I want to see the refinery turn to profit, generate free cash flow that we can reinvest back into LyondellBasell. And we're going to continue to focus on that. And in terms of portfolio, we'll continue to -- we'll consider options over time. But at the moment, the key is to get the refinery to generate free cash flow. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Steve Byrne : Hi. Bob. You talked about both mechanical and molecular recycling, and I'm just curious your longer term views on these. Is your motivation to develop these projects to help drive a plastic recycling industry or do you think either one of them could become really meaningful contributors to your business model in, say, the next five years? Bob Patel : Good morning, Steve. First of all, I think what's really important when we undertake this plastics debate is that we've got to close the loop. We have to prevent leakage of plastics into the environment as the first objective. Then when we've collected that waste my view is that we're going to need a range of solutions, chemical recycling, mechanical recycling and so on. And so, yes, indeed our ambition is to have a platform in both areas in mechanical and chemical recycling and have a sustainable business platform over the long-term. We expect to earn returns just like we do in any other investment. Where I wouldn't -- where I would perhaps draw difference here is that the timeline will be a little longer in terms of how long it takes for us to have a platform that's scalable. We're very committed to that in both chemical and mechanical recycling. And I see a path to success there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. My question is on polyethylene. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on price evolution here. There was a $0.03 increase that the industry was able to get in September. Do you see that potentially sticking through the next quarter or two? And if so why? And if not would you expect prices to come down in December per usual kind of seasonality? What are the drivers that you're looking at to help you understand or form some outlook on polyethylene pricing? Thanks. Bob Patel : Okay. So Arun first I start with the market backdrop. And in the prepared remarks in our slides we showed you that through the end of the third quarter, the net price change is zero so to me that indicates that markets are somewhat balanced. We've seen reasonable amount of destocking. Recent industry reports have indicated even PE inventories have come down in the U.S. So the backdrop going into the fourth quarter to us feels like there's not a lot of excess inventory downstream because of all of the factors that are -- the macro factors that have created lack of confidence. Also I mentioned that the Asia PE to naphtha spreads are currently at very low levels around $300 per ton. And if you look back over the last 10 years these are kind of trough levels when we get to this point on Asia PE to naphtha spreads. So yes, we could have some seasonal pricing adjustments like we do every year in the fourth quarter. But I don't expect extraordinary changes because we've reached some evidence of trough, sort of, conditions whether you think about destocking or if you look at this PE to naphtha spread in Asia. And I think that's one that's held through if you look back over the last 10 years. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about things. And then next year once we get into the spring season, we'll see continued demand growth like we do every year. And anyone will recall that typically the growth in a year happens in the first nine months of the year. So by the time we get into the spring we should start to feel the impact of demand growth going into 2020. So I'm quite constructive at all of this because I think we've already had in some ways quite a correction in terms of inventories and margins. And the evidence I would point to is the Asia PE to naphtha spread. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Bhavesh Lodaya : Hi. Good morning, Bob. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Bob Patel : Good morning. Bhavesh Lodaya : On the Chinese JV with Bora, it appears everything is going according to plan there. Can you share what goalpost are you tracking there as you go ahead? And what gets you more comfortable in terms of making additional investments in the region? Bob Patel : Well, there's a few factors especially with the Bora JV. First of all, it's based on our polyolefin technology. And the construction costs are almost half of what they would be on the Gulf Coast. So those are two really important factors. The construction is about 50% complete now. So by the time, we have definitive agreements and we're at a point where we're going to contribute equity into the venture, it'll be even more closer to startup. So all of those factors give us good confidence about the costs and the denominator and the return equation if you will. It's product that's produced in China for China. So it's a large growing market. And we're very confident about our ability to place that product. And as we look ahead to other investments I think this will be a very good test case for us and build our capability and our presence locally in the region so that when there are future phases in the Bora JV we should be able to invest with confidence and grow our position in a very important market. So those are all of the factors that give us confidence in our investment when we conclude the joint venture with Bora. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now open. Frank Mitsch : Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Thomas it was nice to work with you and certainly wish you the best for the future. Thomas Aebischer : Thank you, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Bob, as I looked at the I&D business, you've had four quarters in a row of negative year-over-year comps and your LTM EBITDA is at $1.6 billion. Is this kind of the base level that we should be thinking about this business? Or how do you think about kind of the base level of earnings of I&D? And I guess as part of that is there anything you can offer with respect to what the pace of economic activity has been either on the industrial or consumer side that has had that impact on I&D being down as I said four quarters in a row? Bob Patel : Well, so Frank the puts and takes on I&D have been that styrene has weakened considerably as has methanol. And as you know when you think about the I&D business that's the part of the portfolio that provides the upside. And when it's not there we kind of land where we are now. That's an indication of those value chains and how the demand is evolving in this styrene value chain. PO has been a bit weaker as well because of automotive. That's been a consistent story throughout the year. And methanol has weakened as well. Now offsetting all of that has been a bitter oxyfuel business. So we've had not only better blend premiums this year, but also cheaper butane especially in the U.S. So Frank for I&D, I mean, you really have to look at this whole portfolio because there are typically offsets. If one is doing better the other doesn't. Not that they're correlated but we find that it's unusual if all of them were trough conditions. So difficult to really point at an exact number, but the part of our portfolio that provides upside has corrected considerably when you think about styrene and methanol. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Bob, a lot of discussion around ethylene polyethylene and I think you've made your case pretty clear that most capacity additions are behind us things potentially could cycle up from here. Could you also give us your views on the polypropylene side of things? How are you thinking about supply/demand over there? And how should we be thinking about sort of 2020? I mean, would sort of margins be a tailwind a headwind? Any sort of thoughts around that will be good. Bob Patel : Sure, Hassan. So, on polypropylene, there is some new capacity that's starting up next year. But our sense is that, we kind of go sideways. As demand grows likely, this capacity, new capacity will be absorbed. And polypropylene growth rates have been pretty strong. We think those could be bolstered by an improvement in the automotive sector. We have seen this over the last 10 years that when the automotive sector comes back, you really see a big burst in demand. And we saw this back in '12 and '13. We saw it in '16, so likely that will benefit PP as well. And today, the economics include -- or today's margins factor in a very weak automotive market, which probably has more impact on PP than PE. So, I think kind of net of more supply maybe better demand, we go sideways from '19 to '20. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thank you, and best wishes as well Thomas. Thomas Aebischer : Thanks, John. John Roberts : There's relatively little discussion about polypropylene. I assume, it underperformed polyethylene because its more durables exposed and was Europe significantly different than the U.S.? Bob Patel : No. You'll recall that polypropylene is really more of a regional market. There is some global trade, but generally there's -- it's more of a regional market. So, Europe and U.S. in terms of demand performance are similar. U.S. probably a little bit better because the automotive sector has been hit much harder in Europe than it has here. And frankly, we see that more in our compounding business, where Europe is weaker. So, polypropylene has been a decent business this year for us. And as I mentioned in a prior question, that I see the net of sort of capacity additions and demand growth showing sideways sort of performance from this year to next. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Sison : Hey guys, nice quarter. Bob, when you think about your outlook for the fourth quarter, you sort of talked about normal seasonal kind of decline fourth quarter versus third quarter and a lot of companies are seeing much more dire sort of outlook sequentially. So, is there anything different in either polyethylene or your other markets that you're not seeing sort of a weaker sequential decline? Bob Patel : Well, I think we've already seen a lot of the destocking and sort of weakness in our markets throughout the whole year. I mean, if you go back to Q1, Q2 trade uncertainty, recession fears expectations of new capacity causing pricing to come down. That has all caused destocking downstream. And so, typically, when you go into fourth quarter, you see some destocking because of year-end, but my sense is a lot of that's already occurred especially in polyethylene. And again, I would point you to the Asia PE to naphtha spread. I mean it's really showing trough conditions. So this expectation of weaker markets has been around and the sentiment has been there for most of this year and has driven buyer behavior. So, other than a directionally some seasonal impacts that we get every year, it's difficult to imagine there would be a lot more. Thomas Aebischer : And Mike, I would remind you that the fourth quarter of 2018 was very weak, so it should be easy -- fairly easy to beat that comp. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Over the past four, five years, polyethylene globally has grown I think pretty close to 5%. At what rate do you think it grew or it's growing in 2019? Bob Patel : So, Jeff polyethylene has grown probably more like 4% to 4.5% in the timeframe you described. And this year, it's still growing kind of in that range, maybe a little bit lower. Again, as I mentioned earlier with destocking happening globally and the concerns around trade and so on, I think we've seen a little bit reduction in this demand growth, but a lot of its packaging based, so -- and consumable end use demand. So we're still very constructive about demand growth on polyethylene going forward. Thomas Aebischer : I think it's hard to sort out this year because the increased exports from North America. We're going to have to see where all that polyethylene ended up at the end of things especially after the trade lanes got readjusted after the tariffs. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Bob. You said earlier that return timelines and plastic waste projects might be longer than for conventional projects. Related to that, you recently signed on to a commitment with the trade association to serve the interest of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Could you please comment on how you would address another situation in which a stakeholder interest might conflict with maximizing value for shareholders? For example, if a stakeholder objected to using cash for share repurchases and instead wanted you to use that cash for something else, how would you resolve the conflict? I'm just trying to understand where shareholders fit in the hierarchy of priorities. Bob Patel : Indeed. Well, I think with stakeholders, we have to emphasize that our aim is to be a going concern that generates good results, so that we can have sustainability in our business model. And we're responsible and disciplined on how we deploy the cash flow we earn not only how we do it, but what we do it that actually earn the cash flow. And so I would frame it in that way that it's important that we generate the results we do keeping all stakeholders in mind and deploy the cash flow that we deploy keeping all stakeholders in mind. And I think frankly, we've done that. So I don't know that this new commitment requires a change in our approach. I think we've been living by this in the past, and we'll continue to do that in the future. And as it relates to share repurchases the idea is to have a really strong company over a long period of time. And so we're going to be very prudent in where we invest. And shareholders are a very important stakeholder constituency. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Jonas Oxgaard : Thank you for squeezing me in here. You're talking about increasing export. Could you talk a little bit about what percentage of your PE is exported now where it's going and what kind of price realizations you get on those volumes? Bob Patel : So today Jonas about 20% of our PE is exported. That's come up actually from low double digits. So we've already increased our exports. And I can imagine next year after we start Hyperzone that we will increase that further and approach the industry average of something like mid-30s, I think in exports 30% to 35% of export out of the U.S. We'll likely still be under that, but approach that a little bit more as we go into next year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. On the sustainability and circularity discussion could you provide some initial thoughts to help you think about what the next 10 years might look like in terms of your willingness to shift to using bionaphtha for example in Europe, your willingness to let circularity investment move above say 10% of CapEx over time. And would you be willing to buy recyclable products from other companies in order to get you a certain mix in your total portfolio over time? Bob Patel : Yeah. So, Laurence on bio based naphtha, we've already demonstrated we can crack that in our investment Germany site. And as we find more sources of that, we'll \u2013 our aim is to scale that up. And I think over time based on availability of feedstock and our ability to evolve technology, I'm convinced that we're going to have very sustainable good return sort of business models and it's been sort of the nature of our industry, and our company is that first we innovate, and then we get to scale so we can earn returns. And I don't see mechanical recycling, chemical recycling any differently. We're on the front end of this investment I'm fully prepared that while the investments are very modest at this point, we perhaps will have a little longer time horizon. But we will be able to scale up at the right time and we welcome the adoption of circularity. We think it's very important as we think about the use of plastics going into the long term. And again, as I mentioned earlier the most important comparative today is to prevent the leakage of plastic waste or plastic pallets into the environment. Then once we collect that companies like us are endeavoring to use that waste in many different ways to create new products to close the loop. And we're very committed to that, and we'll continue to invest in that regard. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.\\ Matthew Blair : Hey, Bob. Thanks for taking my question. So naphtha pricing has generally weakened this year relative to crude. There's a thought that it may soften more going forward and that can either come from the demand-side as a crackers shift to lighter feedstocks or maybe from the supply side as U.S. shale crude production grows. Do you \u2013 what's your view on this? Are you worried about naphtha getting weaker? And if so how would that affect the cost curve for PE and potential pricing for PE? Bob Patel : Hey, Matthew, good morning, good question. So as you mentioned rightly naphtha's already come-off quite a lot. And frankly, that's part of what's ailing our refining performances. We don't have a refinery, so when some of these products like naphtha and propylene and others come down in price that further directionally affects the results at the refinery. Having said all that, I always kind of go back to historical naphtha premiums or discounts. And I think we're at a point where, if there is \u2013 if there is further reduction in naphtha relative to crude oil, it's hard to imagine that that would be sustained. If it does there are offsets. Obviously, our European operations would benefit from that because naphtha will become a lot cheaper. We also could crack more naphtha, if it was advantaged compared to ethane here in the U.S. So I mean, I think they're sort of \u2013 there's two sides to the ledger in terms of naphtha and we'll have to work our way through that. But it seems to me that a sustained step down in naphtha is more difficult to contemplate. Operator : Thank you. And that was our final question. And I will turn the meeting back over to Mr. David Kinney. Bob Patel : Thank you. This is Bob Patel. I'll offer a few closing remarks. First of all, thanks for all the great questions. Our company is delivering resilient performance during these times of macro uncertainty, market headwinds and weak industrial demand. At LyondellBasell, we're not simply waiting for markets to rebound. We're taking steps to further increase our cash flow, make disciplined investment decisions and create more value for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you on our full year results and growth initiatives during our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, we'll end the call. Hope you all have a great weekend. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.",

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, Britany. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation of the company's today\u2019s call is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making references to some forward-looking statements, and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with other disclosures including the earnings release are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 :00 PM, Eastern Time today until 11 :59 PM, Eastern Time on March 2, by calling 800 759 4057 in the United States; and 402 998 0479, outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 1160. During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full-year results, the current environment our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives. With that being said, I would now like to turn call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you who participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2019. Let's begin with slide 3 and review some highlights. In 2019, LyondellBasell\u2019s businesses extended our outstanding track record of cash generation by delivering $5 billion of cash from operating activities. Over the past six years, our resilient business portfolio has steadily produced $5 billion to $6 billion of cash each year under a variety of oil prices and macroeconomic conditions. Our company's focus on operational excellence cost management and technology-driven growth has proven that we have an advantage across a range of business climates. 2019 earnings were $9.58 per share with $5.7 billion of EBITDA. This represents a decline of approximately 20% and 17%, respectively, relative to the prior year. Despite healthy consumer-driven demand, our profitability was impacted by soft industrial demand has trade uncertainty, regulatory changes and a weak environment for capital investment challenge the automotive industry and other durable goods markets for our products. Our global asset footprint and operational flexibility enabled us to adapt to changes in trade lines by continuing to leverage the advantage of abundant, low-cost natural gas liquids has be stopped for production from both our American operations and our Middle East joint ventures. Our technology business achieved record revenues from licensing plan designs to support growth in China resulting in the most profitable year in company history for this segment. Before we get further into the results, I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Michael McMurray. Michael brings extensive knowledge and perspective to the company after working in finance, Investor Relations, treasury and as a CFO over the course of more than 30 years. I'm looking forward to Michael providing our finance and strategy groups with the leadership and will drive our continued success. Michael, welcome to LyondellBasell. Mike McMurray : Thank you for the kind words, Bob. I'm excited to be part of LyondellBasell and your partner in driving our future. In my first several weeks in the company, I'm very impressed with the people and results oriented culture within the company. I look forward to meeting all our stakeholders and the investment community in describing how we will continue our disciplined approach to value driven growth while driving shareholder returns. Bob Patel : Thanks, Michael. Let's turn to slide 4 and review our approach to maximizing the returns from our cash generation. Over the past year, we continue to actively manage our business portfolio with values driven growth investments to develop opportunities around the world. On the US Gulf Coast, we completed construction of our new hyperzone polyethylene plant and increased activity to build our PO/TBA. As hyperzone production ramps up this year and the PO/TBA plant reaches completion next year. Both projects will provide growth in volumes and profitability that will further increase our capacity for cash generation. The box on the right summarizes work to expand our footprint in the rapidly growing Asian market during 2019. We announced that our joint venture in Thailand will begin construction of their fourth polypropylene plant that will re-establish their position as the largest polypropylene producer in Southeast Asia. In September, we signed an MoU with Bora to build an integrated cracker in Northeast China. And in December, announced our intention to expand our existing partnership with Sinopec to build a second propylene oxide and styrene monomer plant also in China. All of these projects leverage LyondellBasell technologies in our core businesses to extend our positions and expand in the world's fastest growing markets. With the disciplined investments, we are achieving growth, while providing substantial returns for shareholders. On Slide 5, you can see that our company has maintained our focus on delivering top quartile safety performance. As we integrated the employees, contractors and assets from the A. Schulman acquisition in 2019, we were able to reduce the injury rate at these facilities by more than 50% relative to the prior year. Our goal remains zero injuries. We're diligently working to ensure all our employees, contractors, assets and the communities in which we operate, finish the day in the same or better condition than when they started. In October 2019, we announced the latest step in our progress to utilize plastic waste in the circular economy. We're building a power plant facility at our research center in Ferrara, Italy to develop our proprietary MoReTec technology to convert mixed plastic waste continue into polymers. As shown on slide 6, MoReTec will use catalyzed hydrolysis to convert plastic wastes into hydrocarbons that can be used as feedstocks to produce new plastics from existing olefins crackers and polymerization plants. We will develop more technology in our pilot facility and optimize a tour to commercial scale. More tech is complimentary to lined up Lyondell the existing mechanically recycled product business that relied upon clean and sorted waste streams. Together with our bio based succulent polymers, our company now has three technologies that are advancing the business of succulent plastics. With that I'll turn the call over to Michael who will lead us through several topics relating to our financial performance. Mike McMurray : Thank you, Bob. Let's get on Slide 7 where you can see the trends, our companies EBITDA and EPS over the past three years. 2019 results include a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $85 billion that increased earnings by $0.24 per share. Integration cost related to A. Schulman acquisition impacted full year net income results by $89 million or $0.26 per share and fourth quarter results by $0.29 million or $0.08 per share. As Bob mentioned, our profitability was impacted by challenging market conditions during 2019. Using third quarter 2019 results as a benchmark, our resilience relative to our industry peers during these challenging times is noteworthy. While it appears profitability fell as much as two thirds LyondellBasell\u2019s global business portfolio formed relatively well with approximately two-thirds for asset volume serving non-durable demand from consumer markets. Our businesses are generally well-positioned during industrial downturns. Slide 8 illustrates the consistent and efficient cash flow performance that Bob mentioned earlier. Our businesses have generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities over the past six years. In 2019 87% of our EBITDA translated into cash With approximately $1 billion dedicated to sustaining capital, our free operating cash flow yield remained healthy at 12.5% in 2019. Please turn to Slide 9 and allow me to review our capital allocation strategy. Our approach remains consistent with the policies we have articulated last September at our Investor Day and, frankly, for the past several years. We seek to provide balance between value-driven growth and shareholder returns. We remain committed to a strong and aggressively growing dividend. Our capital expenditures are focused on ensuring our assets maintain their high levels of reliability, as well as sending [ph] profitable growth. With the completion of the Hyperzone in PO/TBA projects, our go-CapEx will taper down. Our cash generation provides flexibility for highly selective value-driven M&A, growth through JVs and opportunistic share repurchases. At the same time, we are mindful about maintaining the appropriate leverage ratios and our commitment to a strong investment-grade balance sheet underlies all of our decisions. Now please turn to Slide 10, where you can see that our businesses generated $1.2 billion of cash with moderate activities during the fourth quarter which contributed to $5 billion of cash generation for the year. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $730 million with roughly 60% invested in profit-generating growth projects and 40% dedicated to sustaining capital. Our investment in growth has increased since the second quarter of 2019, as we completed our Hyperzone polyethylene plant and continued to move our PO/TBA plant construction forward. In the fourth quarter, we paid $351 million in dividends. In 2019, our opportunistic buyback strategy allows us to repurchase 43 million shares for a total of $3.8 billion, together with dividends, returned a total of $5.2 billion to shareholders in 2019. Along with that thought, I would like to compare our capital returns to some of our peers over the prior four quarters. Please turn to Slide 11. The dark blue bars depict dividend yield which was nearly 5% over the trailing 12 months prior to the fourth quarter. Together with share repurchases, our company tops the chart with 20% of total cap returns to shareholders. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2020 on slide 12. Regarding capital expenditures, we are planning to invest approximately $2.4 billion during 2020 to support both our sustaining capital and profit-generating projects. Approximately $1.3 billion is targeted towards profit-generating growth. The majority of this growth investment in 2020 will be dedicated to the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston. We continue to expect a meaningful reduction in capital spending in 2022 after the completion of this facility. For 2020, with a fairly typical planned maintenance schedule, activities during the year are expected to impact annual EBITDA by approximately $155 million. Our O&P Americas segment will have a cracker turnaround overlapping the first and second quarters of this year that is expected to impact EBITDA by $25 million and $30 million, respectively. Our O&P EAI segment will have a cracker turnaround in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 that is expected to impact EBITDA by $15 million in each quarter. In our Intermediates & Derivatives segment, we have planned maintenance events that will impact EBITDA by approximately $10 million in each of the first and second quarters and $25 million in each of the third or fourth quarters this year. Our cash interest expense for 2020 is expected to be $420 million which includes capitalized interest of about $120 million. 2020 annual book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be $1.5 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2020 that total approximately $120 million and we estimate a pension expense of $100 million. We currently expect a 2020 effective tax rate of approximately 20% for the cash tax rate in the. mid-teens. I will now turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob? Bob Patel : Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to slide 13 which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the last five quarters. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion. As you have seen, LyondellBasell\u2019s business portfolio typically follows a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring mid-year. In the absence of external catalysts, that improve order [indiscernible] from our underlying businesses, the pattern seen in 2019 are fairly typical. We have a focused and well balanced portfolio supported by our global footprint, flexibility and reliable operations. These are recurring themes for our company and attributes that we seek to improve upon as we manage the portfolio. Even in the uncertain market conditions, our company continues to demonstrate resilience. We talked last quarter about polyethylene spreads being near 10-year lows. And on slide 14, we've expanded that idea to illustrate the market margins associated with some of our major products. Each market has experienced several cycles over the past 20 years. Most recently, we are faced with slow industrial demand and uncertainty in trade policies. Margins are currently relatively strong for North American polypropylene and for MTBE On the flipside, we're seeing historically weak margins for styrene and Northeast Asia polyethylene. Some of you may be surprised to learn that globally we sell higher volumes of polypropylene and oxyfuels than polyethylene and styrene. These charts illustrate how our portfolio provides balance where our product and trough margins is often offset by another which from margins within the portfolio. With these natural hedges across our global footprint and an innovative technology, cost advantage, operational flexibility and consistent underlying consumer-driven demand, LyondellBasell is well positioned to provide resilient profitability. With the market conditions in line, let's review our fourth quarter segment results starting with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on slide 15. Fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA was $498 million, $155 million lower than third quarter. Profitability was impacted by reduced polyethylene margin from typical winter seasonality and an increased cost of ethylene production as feedstock costs were higher and propylene price was lower compared to the previous quarter. Olefins results decreased approximately $20 million compared to the third quarter of 2019. Margin contracted on relatively higher natural gas liquid feedstock costs and lower propylene price. Volume increased after the completion of our planned maintenance at our Clinton, Iowa facility during the third quarter. Combined, polyolefin results were approximately $135 million lower than the third, quarter primarily due to a decline in polyethylene spreads over of more than $130 per ton. For the full year, results decreased by $460 million. Olefins results increased as we utilize the high feedstock flexibility across our fleet of six US ethylene crackers to take advantage of low, low cost feedstocks. Combined polyolefins results declined primarily due to the spread decline in polyethylene of approximately $260 per ton. We expect the remainder of the first quarter will follow typical seasonal trends with increasing demand continuing into the second quarter. Now we turn to slide 16 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins; Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $144 million, a decrease of $147 million, compared to the third quarter. Ethylene margin declined as a result of higher feedstock costs and lower propylene price. With typical fourth quarter seasonality pressuring volumes, there was little support to increase polyethylene price. Olefins results decreased approximately $140 million, primarily driven by higher feedstock costs and lower propylene price. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $45 million driven by decreased spread in both polyethylene and polypropylene. Full-year EBITDA was $101 million lower than 2018. Results including impact of approximately $55 million due to a decrease in the euro versus the US dollar exchange rate relative to 2018. Olefins results for the full year increased due to lower feedstock costs and improved reliability with planned and unplanned maintenance impacting the fourth quarter of 2018. Combined polyolefin results and joint venture equity income decreased due to lower polyolefin spreads. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progressed through the first and second quarters similar to the amendments. Please turn to Slide 17 and let\u2019s take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $329 million, a decline of $61 million from the third quarter of 2019. Well-supplied markets drove margin decline in most businesses for both propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals. Fourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased approximately $10 million due to lower margins from our product sales mix. Intermediate chemicals decreased $50 million primarily due to reduced margin oxyfuels and related products results for relatively unchanged with the strongest fourth quarter for the company over the past five years. During 2019 EBITDA declined $454 million compared to the record performance we achieved in 2018. Margin declined in most businesses primarily styrene partially offset by strong improvement in margins for our oxyfuels and related products businesses. Volumes for most businesses also declined due to planned and unplanned maintenance as well as softer market. In January MTBE raw material margins have trended downward but are still relatively strong for this month compared to recent years. As the first quarter progresses we expect well-supplied markets to continue to pressure most of our IND businesses. Recently, we announced our intention to expand our existing partnership with Sinopec to build a second PO SM plant in China. Joint ventures enable us to expand our reach with relatively low capital commitments in attractive markets. The proposed new JV will serve growing demand for both propylene oxide and styrene in China where styrene soaring demand is growing at a reasonable rate. As demand for fuel-based construction materials packaging and furnishings continues to grow we see an opportunity to bring together our leading technology with Sinopec\u2019s and operational capabilities to further serve the Chinese market. The chart on Slide 18 depicts the company's cost leadership in producing propylene oxide from our two co-product technologies. We're building using our cost leading PO/TBA technology on the US Gulf Coast where butane feedstocks are abundant and low price. In China we have selected our PO/SM technology to serve growing propylene oxide and styrene demand. Both of our co-product technologies offer a significant cost advantage over new plants based on alternative technology or aging or chlorohydrin capacity. On slide 19 let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $54 million, a $48 million decline over the third quarter of 2019. Volumes and margins declined as we are seeing continued headwinds from the automotive sector and a seasonal decline in the construction market. Fourth quarter pretax innovation cost were $38 million. Compared with the prior period Compounding & Solutions results declined approximately $35 million due to continued headwinds in the automotive market. Advanced Polymer\u2019s results decreased about $20 million due to lower margin and volume due to a seasonal decline in construction demand. Full-year EBITDA results for the segment were $424 million, a $24-million improvement over 2018. 2019 was the first full year of results with the addition of new product lines from the acquisition of A. Schulman. Pretax integration costs were $116 million in 2019. Volumes declined in legacy LyondellBasell businesses due to decreased automotive and construction demand. Integration activities are on track, and we have captured $130 million in forward annualized run rate synergies as of December 31. We expect higher industrial construction demand, particularly for products from our Advanced Polymers business, as we move through the first quarter toward the arrival of spring. Any improvements in automotive and other industrial markets should benefit our Compounding & Solutions business. Now let's turn to Slide 20 and discuss the performance of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $22 million, a $28 million improvement versus the third quarter of 2019. Results were driven by an improvement in margin. In the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread improved to an average of $19.44 per barrel for the fourth quarter. Additionally, we benefited from relatively strong [indiscernible] prices. Operations were strong for the quarter with an average crude throughput near nameplate production rate at 267,000 barrels per day. Full-year EBITDA was $232 million, lower than 2018. The refinery ran well at an average crude throughput The refinery run well at an average crude throughput of 263,000 barrels per day. This was 32,000 barrels per day higher than prior years due to the completion of planned maintenance in 2018. For the full-year refining margins were impacted by the limited availability of our heavy sour crude oil in the US Gulf Coast as well as lower Maya 2-1-1 spread which declined to $17.58 per barrel. In January, weak command for diesel has driven Gulf Coast ULSD to Brent crack spreads to five-year lows. While we are disappointed by the current market environment, we continue to expect improvement, as the carriage ban on high-sulfur and marine fuels takes effect in March. We are well-positioned to benefit from the new regulation by serving demand for more environmentally friendly Marine fuels from our refinery. Please turn to slide 21 as we review the results of our technology segment. In 2019, our technology segment delivered a record quarter and record annual profitability with our industry-leading polymer production technologies and catalysts. EBITDA was $138 million during the fourth quarter and was $411 million for the full year with a number of significant revenue milestone was reached for our licensing business. We expect lower license income recognition, and therefore, lower profitability in the first quarter following the strong fourth quarter in 2019. Now, on slide 22, I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our company's disciplined investment growth strategy that we shared with you during our 2019 Investor Day. We expect the contributions from our growth investments to deliver a $1.3 billion incremental annual EBITDA by 2022. Applying cash yield from EBITDA of about 80% combined with our moderating CapEx requirement of approximately $1.1 billion, we expect an increase in cash flow about $2.1 billion that would double our free cash flow by 2022. Let me summarize the year highlights and outlook with slide 23. In 2019, our resilient portfolio was supported by our abundant low-cost natural gas liquid feedstocks in North America, natural hedges across our global business portfolio and licensing growth in our technology segment. We have generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities for six consecutive years. This consistent and strong cash generation contributed to growth through disciplined profit generating capital investments and provided significant shareholder returns through a growing top quartile dividend and share repurchases. In 2020, we look forward to the additional capacity from our Hyperzone polyethylene plant for O&P Americas segment. We are moving towards the completion of our PO/TBA plant in 2021 to provide further growth for our I&D segment. We're seeing opportunities to drive value by expanding our diverse global business portfolio. We expect to see that these joint venture investments today to reap tangible earnings growth over the years to come. With that said, we're now please take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning, Bob. Maybe you want to start off on refining one of the bright spots in the quarter. Could you talk about whether you were able to run high sulfur for fuel oil as a feed at your Houston refinery? And if so, what kind of volumes and what kind of EBITDA uplift? And if you were not, was the constraint economic or was it equipment-related? Any details on that would be great. Bob Patel : Yeah. Good morning, Matthew. Thanks for your question. On refining, the HSFO, we are able to run supplemental feed typically when we've cut back on crude run rates for a variety of reasons. So we can run between 20,000 and 40000 barrels a day of additional HSFO and I would say in a typical month, maybe that contributes $5 million to $9 million of additional EBITDA. So that gives you a sense for contribution and we did do some of that fact in January because we had some external events that caused some downtime on one of our crude units and some internal issues so we were able to buy some HSFO. The margins were pretty good. So, we do use that as an optimization tool. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Byrne. Your line is now open. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. What fraction of your polyethylene production is currently exported to China and what other markets will this likely shift to as China becomes more self-sufficient? Are you able to move more of it into Europe and or do you have a concern that others might do this and erode the margins in that region? Bob Patel : Yes, Steve. Good morning. Well first of all, we\u2019ve not exported as much generally as the industry has in years past and 2019 is no different. We did increase exports in 2019 as the year progressed, but we're still well below the industry average. And we're probably at a run rate of around 30% of our polyethylene that's exported. And of that, maybe 5% of it goes to China. And that could move up some next year \u2013 this year in 2020, as we start up our Hyperzone plant and balance our system. Your question about self-sufficiency, based on IHS data and our analysis of that data, it seems that China will continue to need large amounts of imports of polyethylene and that short still is incrementally growing over the next decade. Now it's not growing as much as we thought maybe two, three years ago, but there's still a significant short in China on polyethylene. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Bob, I wondering if you could address the impact of the phase out of single use plastics in China? And also comment on your -- Table 2 of your supplemental information, suggests that high-density polyethylene prices declined, about $110 a ton sequentially in 4Q versus 3Q. It seems to be a little bit more than maybe some of the consultants are indicating and so I was wondering if you could comment on that and whether or not you're seeing discounting? And if so, might that reverse as 2020 progresses. Thank you. Bob Patel : Okay. So, good morning, Kevin. On your question about single-use plastics, I think we\u2019ll have to see how that announcement plays out. Whether it\u2019s in China or Europe or the US, one of the challenges is there aren\u2019t really readily available substitutes for many of the applications for single-use plastics. So, in the near term, Kevin, I don\u2019t expect significant impact on demand over, let\u2019s say, the next three to five years. I think, post five years, I think we'll have to kind of watch and see how recycling shapes up and how chemical recycling develops and the technology develops. But in the near to medium term, I don't expect a lot of impact especially because there aren't really obvious substitutes for those applications. Your question on price from Q4 to Q3, several factors, I think first of all, as I said earlier, as the year progressed, we export more as an industry, and frankly, as a company. And so that mix of domestic versus export probably had some impact. And also, new supply came on. We saw demand actually come off because of destocking and seasonality. So tons of pressure in Q4. We've already seen some of that reverse. For example, posted spot polyethylene prices have already come up $0.03 to $0.04 since early December based on different publications that we follow. So we're already seeing some of that reverse. David Kinney : Kevin, this is Dave. That table that you're referring to is actually the net transaction price from IHS. It\u2019s not the contract price per se for polyethylene discount. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Can you talk about polypropylene demand trends both in the United States and in Europe either sequentially or year over year in the light of the slowing of the economy and difficulties in the auto sector. Bob Patel : Polypropylene demand growth, Jeff, has been similar to polyethylene demand growth. It's been impacted a little bit because of the slowdown in automotive and generally in the industrial sector. Polypropylene as more end uses in those sectors. Would we still see a reasonable \u2013 a reasonably good market environment in polypropylene, something that we'll certainly watch as new capacity comes in 2020. But overall, we see polypropylene growth developing reasonably well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan : I just wanted to ask your question on the monomer side. You've often had some profitability from the metastasis unit. Could you size what that's been over the last several years and what your outlook is for both ethylene and propylene monomer profitability over the next couple of years? Thanks. Bob Patel : Yeah. Thanks, Arun. It does move around quite a lot. As you can imagine, depending on poly \u2013 sorry, propylene price and the spread between propylene and ethylene. Generally speaking, if in Q4 and you look at all of our major product areas they really declined through the quarter and have reached kind of these tough conditions and propylene is an example of that. So, in Q4 when we had really minimal contribution from our flex unit mainly as a result of lower propylene price. So as that reverses we should see better contribution from ethylene and into propylene. It does this \u2013 it moves around quite a lot and it's something that we factor into our optimization because we think about how we deploy the ethylene we produce. David Kinney : Yeah, Arun, just to give you a sense of scale in 2019 our flex profitability was about half of what it might have been in 2018 and as Bob said in the fourth quarter it was very, very small. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open. Duffy Fischer : Just a question sort of around the refinery sort of round IMO 2020. I'm getting a lot of feedback that people are kind of equating that with Y2K. We got all bent out of shape and there's not been much change because of it. Seems like you guys have a little bit different view and maybe it's just delayed so can you kind of walk through how you think IMO 2020 still plays out and then within that context what does that mean structurally for the refinery within Lyondell\u2019s portfolio? Bob Patel : Okay. Yeah. Good morning, Duffy. Thanks for that question. So you will recall in our prior discussions about IMO what we've said is there are two primary benefits from IMO for us. One is that the light heavy differential would get wider which favors our refinery and the distillate spreads would increase because of the value of this sulfur, a bunker fuel. So one of the two have shown some signs of improvement. The light heavy differential is improved by about $3 a barrel over the past 90, 60-90 days or so compared to what we saw most of last year. So we're starting to see a bit of response on that. And you can see it in the numbers, they\u2019re not terrific but they're getting better. On the distillate side, there\u2019s been a couple of factors that have actually kept distillate crack spreads down or they\u2019ve\u2019 actually \u2013 they\u2019ve reduced in the last 60 days. One is I think, we probably \u2013 we all underestimated the amount of inventory of compliant fuel that was built before year-end. To your point, there was a concern about would there be enough and I think perhaps, there was more than enough. And so there's a bit of overhang, which will be worked through. So I think, I see that as a temporary situation. Secondly, we've had a really mild winter, so distillate values have come down because there hasn't been as much demand for heating. Again, I think a seasonal effect. So to summarize in terms of IMO, I think that the effect will be \u2013 it\u2019s somewhat delayed, but we are expecting some improvement in the refinery profitability as a result IMO. Your question about portfolio, again, our focus has been very consistent; run the refinery as well as possible, try to optimize on the product side so that we can maximize value and we're continually focused on that. And we'll see how things play out longer term. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning. Bob, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Asian PE markets. And maybe two things to touch on, one, the margins have been negative there for a while now longer than \u2013 if I look back over the last 10 years, usually they don't stay that negative for too long before capacity comes off and they at least go back to zero, and that hasn't happened. And the big thing that looks like it\u2019s happened is that naphtha prices have been very strong certainly in the fourth quarter. Maybe they come off a little bit year-to-date due to the coronavirus, but what is driving the naphtha price versus a relatively flat crude oil price, and why aren't we seeing Asian capacity come off line given the losses? Bob Patel : Yeah. Good morning, Vincent. Really good question, I think, and this is really at the crux of sort of why we think we're reaching trough conditions in polyethylene globally. As you rightly mentioned, margins today appear to be below cash costs. So you would think there would be negative earnings on many of these units, not just the highest cost, but probably deep into the cost curve. I've been following this business for many years, including when I lived in Asia more than 10 years ago. And typically when you fall below 300, it's not just a few marginal crackers but many are underwater. My sense is that typically it takes perhaps a quarter or two of these sorts of conditions for there to be meaningful reduction in output or idling of capacity. We're nearing that stage, in my opinion, and it seems to me that we should see some bounce. And as I said earlier, if you look at -- posted export prices of polyethylene from mid-December to mid-January, they have moved somewhat. So again, I think, these are all signs of trough conditions and there should be some bounce off of these really, really unusual loans. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thank you. Could you give us an update on the closing of the Bora deal and if this start-up still on schedule? Bob Patel : Yeah, good morning. We're working diligently to move towards definitive agreements. We expect to have those completed within the first half of this year. In terms of the project\u2019s start-up, they're making really great progress. And I would expect that we'll be in the commissioning stage towards the end of this year for that project. I think that's one of the one of the attractiveness to us of this project is that by the time we're in a position to infuse equity into the venture, we'll be within months of start-up. So the timing between our investment and timing of start-up is very short. We derisked quite a lot of that project in our view as a partner. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good morning, Bob. One more question on your Bora project. At your Analyst Day, you mentioned that the cost of building in China is about half of that in the US. Can you comment about time it takes to build in China? I know crews their work 24/7 to build and so, what's your expectation of timing and does that JV give you any special insight into the timing of some of these new crackers that are starting up in China? Thank you. Bob Patel : Good morning, P.J. Indeed, it's one of the sort of attractions to us is that, first of all, that that project is going to produce product for the local market. So, we don't intend to export. I think it\u2019ll give us a really good window into how the market works there as well. And as you said timing and cost of construction. In terms of the cost, they are between half and two thirds that of Gulf Coast builds and also timing very similar somewhere between half and two-thirds of the time that's required to build on the Gulf Coast. And the Bora project is certainly in that range relative to the US cost and timing. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Bob Koort : Slide 14 talks about those integrated spreads by competitors because good thing you don't have a lot of crackers but coincides with your promise that they were refining a trough. Just a bit curious how that informs or just no use of capital plans. I mean, clearly your stock is getting punished pretty substantially here. You've got a big dividend that you could reduce those payouts by -- maybe buying some stock back. On the other hand, I would imagine targets are looking quite a bit cheaper. So, could you just maybe refresh us maybe early on in the capital deployment at this stage of the market? Bob Patel : Sure. Thanks, Bob. First of all, on CapEx, you'll recall at that Investor Day, we had a few things we highlighted. First of all, sustaining capital of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion, frankly, we don't plan to change that. We want to make sure that our units are well-maintained and are able to operate when we need them at full rates. And because of our dividend coverage, we don't have to do that. We're in a position where we're able \u2013 we have a well-covered dividend without having to take those sorts of steps. Secondly, our CapEx is declining because the Hyperzone project is essentially complete. And so that that capital comes off. So we have somewhere around $300 million to $400 million reduction in CapEx from 2019 to 2020. And then, if you look further out, we'll see another reduction after the PO/TBA project starts up. I think the key for us is to really be thoughtful about how we think through future projects, be very disciplined as we've shown, and I see great opportunity on both sides of the equation to increase cash flow. We see sources of new earnings and we see CapEx declining. That story remains intact as we discussed in Investor Day. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Olympic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan Ahmed : Bob, just wanted to follow up on you made some comments about what you think the trajectory of polyethylene pricing may be, obviously, keeping in mind some of the negative margin trends in Asia. My question is a bit more specific about the grades. As we see the influx of all of this polyethylene capacity in 2020, 2021, it seems there have been a fairly large divergences between the amount of capacity that's coming on line call it in HDPE and linear low versus not that much capacity coming online in LDPE. So, I mean, you know how are you thinking about that? Should we expect to see sort of divergent pricing patterns between the different grades? Bob Patel : Yes. Good question. And I think first of all within your low density \u2013 sorry low density polyethylene supply being less on an absolute basis, the demand growth is also lower for low density polyethylene. So, when I think about high density polyethylene which is the majority of what we produce, we do see that the supply is coming on generally when the demand is there as well. If we see periods of oversupply it's episodic as opposed to structural. So, my sense is that as we work our way through digesting the new supply in 2020 globally then we'll have to see how the timing works out on the future projects. Even in China, some of the projects have been later than they were first announced, so and we're going through startup of our Hyperzone plant right now and if we don't reach full capacity on the first day that we put hydrocarbon in, so these things have a certain ramp up rate, which generally is not reflected in IHS numbers. But I'm somewhat constructive that I think we're \u2013 we've reached the bottom and we're bouncing off of the lows in Q4 and we'll see how demand develops here. Mike McMurray : And Hassan to your point. I mean the days sales of inventory are reported by ACC has dropped for high density by eight days since December of 2018 to December of 2019. Just shows you that the market is tightening up for high density here in North America. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Michael Sison : Hey, guys. Bob, when you think about your EBITDA in the fourth quarter, it held up pretty well given difficult environment sort of across the board. So, when you think about 2020 and your portfolio, can you grow EBITDA on 2020? And if you can, where do you think you'll see some of the potential upside? Bob Patel : Yes. Good morning, Mike. Thanks for that question. Indeed, I think we did hold up well. And in our prepared comments, I mentioned that the Oxyfuels business did well. So, first of all, I think the diversity in our portfolio and that some of these products are at different points in their individual cycles that helps in delivering consistent and strong cash flow. But I think through sources of earnings upside, first of all, start-up of our new Hyperzone polyethylene plant, as I said we're in the process of start-up right now. And so, we should have \u2013 we hope to have production by month-end. So, once that plant is up and running and as Q2 progresses, we start to produce target grade rate that should start to contribute earnings. Also our APS integration work, the integration of A. Schulman continues. We're doing really well run rate synergies at the end of December, we\u2019re at about $130 million annualized. So, we're doing quite well on that. And we should continue to see benefits. The automotive sector has been really depressed globally. And frankly, that hit our legacy compounding business because it was mostly automotive. Any rebound in automotive is going to help that segment. And in our view, with all of our integration work I think we're laying the groundwork for really capitalizing on small improvements. Furthermore, IMO, I talked about that earlier, while we've been disappointed that we haven't seen some response yet, we do believe we will see it. Into Q2, we should see the benefits of IMO in terms of better cracks and even wider light-heavy differential. So those are some examples of earnings upside, if you will, that don't really rely on polyethylene market getting better per se. And also when you think about cash flow or the lower CapEx this year, should be positive as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now open. Frank Mitsch : Good morning. And Michael, nice to meet you at least telephonically, look forward to meeting you in person. Mike McMurray : Thank you, Frank. Frank Mitsch : But Bob, I want to come back to the Sinopec possum JV or the Memorandum of Understanding that you signed last month. You mentioned a little bit about the fact that you're going to be more exposed to styrene in China and have a better prognosis for that business over there. Obviously, this is a business that you have not expressed a lot of positive comments in the past and I'm just curious, has your outlook for styrene overall changed, where do you see it going, is this the first move of others or was this just opportunistic with Sinopec? If you could expand upon that\u2019d be great. Bob Patel : Sure. Good morning, Frank. First of all, that joint venture is more about deal and less about SM. So it's really a driver for us to invest was propylene oxide, we see a growing market there over time. We have a great partner in Sinopec, an existing relationship that we're building upon. They have great operational capability as well as capability to build plants, low cost. So, in styrene, the styrene wasn't the reason we did this, we\u2019re undertaking this project. But on the other hand, we believe that in Asia certainly there's still some growth in styrene and we can place that volume when that plant starts up. So, more about fuel, less about styrene but comfortable that we can place the styrene and have considered in our economics the value of styrene. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Bob, can you just discuss the prospects or your views on potential US polyethylene price increase in Q1? I know [indiscernible] pick up in March and April but ethane is cheap are you seeing spot export price pick up here. So, what's your confidence in getting up a P price increase in February and March? Thank you. Bob Patel : Good morning, David. First of all as I mentioned earlier, the spot price has moved up post, on a posted basis right? So $0.03 to $0.04 depending on which publication you read. I think that says that if there\u2019s some underpinning for that increase. Secondly inventories as reported by HCC IHS indicate that inventories are low as producer level anecdotally we believe that the converter level, inventories are also low. We should see a seasonal uptick we do every year and I don't see why this year should be any different. And so, some seasonal uptick should help. Lastly, something that perhaps isn't on everyone's radar that the turnaround season is pretty heavy this year. They\u2019re much heavier than last year on crackers in the US so we could see ethylene be tighter in during the turnaround season as a result of the higher level of capacity that's out. So I think all of those things point towards reasonable chances of improvements. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Jonas Oxgaard : Thank you. Bob, it sounded like you \u2013 you thought that naphtha prices have come back down again in Q2 or so. I was wondering how much of that as an industry view or how much of it is your lined out view? And if it is an industry view, wouldn\u2019t that suggest that the producers in Asia if they all know this would just try to hold on until it crashes instead of shutting down? Bob Patel : Hey Jonas, I think my comment at one of the earlier questions related to I think it was Vincent who asked me about Asian PE margins. My comment was more that those margins should come up from \u2013 from sort of below the breakeven point where they are today. I don't know that necessarily that's going to come from naphtha dropping. I mean it could be that price rises and that's why the margins improve. So if I express the view on naphtha that was not intentional. My view was more about the fact that Asian PE naphtha spreads seem \u2013 seem untenable based on historic and data. And you know my sense is that those margins need to expand some, so that they\u2019re not cash-negative for a significant part of the industry over there. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Bhavesh Lodaya : Okay, thanks. This is Bhavesh for John. Good morning. Bob Patel : Good morning. Bhavesh Lodaya : So for your Technology segment, it has had a solid past couple of years. You shed some color for the first quarter. How should we think about the cadence and size of earnings of the full-year? And if you could just help with some of the underlying drivers for the growth you're seeing in catalyst sales, is it more about describing higher market share or is it just linked to growing the growing industry capacity? Bob Patel : Yes, Bhavesh, first of all, in our Technology segment, there are two components, there\u2019s catalyst and then there\u2019s licensing. So the catalyst business is very steady, and as we do these licenses, our catalyst business steadily grows. That part isn\u2019t very volatile and there\u2019s definitely an upward slope in terms of earnings and one that accrues for many years to come. And the licensing side, it\u2019s much more variable. It depends on timing of payments and licenses we win. Your point is correct, and that we\u2019ve been participating in many of these projects that you -- that are announced in China, primarily. But likely, the licensing side of the business will cool off some in 2020. We do expect some lower earnings from that segment. And yet, on the other hand, as the license plants start up, our catalysts turning should steadily increase over time. And that's really a great part of that Technology businesses is that provides stability of cash flow. David Kinney : All right. So I think that was the last question that we had. So, let me offer a few closing remarks before we sign off. So, our company's proven and continuous focus on operational excellence, cost management and disciplined capital allocation think will serve us really well in this current challenging environment. We anticipate typical seasonal improvements for our businesses as we've progressed through the year, favorable resolution of trade policies and a rebound in industrial demand could potentially provide significant upside for many of our businesses. As I've mentioned several times in the Q&A, IMO 2020 is expected to increase earnings in our refinery. We see increasing polyethylene volumes from our new Hyperzone investment. And I think generally, we're really well poised as a company to deliver and continue our outstanding track record of cash generation in this year to come. So, we thank you for your interest in our company and look forward to updating you in April at the end of the first quarter. Thank you and with that, have a great weekend. We are adjourned. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.",

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's First Quarter 2020 Teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with other disclosures including the earnings release are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 P.M. Eastern Time today until June 1st by calling 866-397-1431 in the United States and 203-369-0538 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 1160. During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results the current environment, our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in first out or LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw materials and finished goods inventories. During the first quarter, we recognized pretax LCM charges totaling $419 million. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. With that being said I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you participating around the world. I hope that you, your colleagues, and your families are all staying healthy during these difficult times. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today as we discuss our Q1 results. Let's begin with slide three and review the first quarter highlights. LyondellBasell's business portfolio continued to deliver relatively resilient performance amid challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic, rapidly falling oil prices, and deteriorating economic activity. Our global asset footprint, feedstock flexibility, and disciplined financial strategies are serving us well and enabling us to navigate through these unprecedented market conditions. Our first quarter EBITDA $1.1 billion represents a decline of approximately 12% relative to the fourth quarter and 25% relative to the first quarter of the prior year. Despite robust demand for our polymers used in consumer packaging and medical applications, profitability was impacted by soft demand for our transportation fuels and products used in automotive and other durable goods end markets. Events surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and the drop in oil prices continue to evolve and impact global markets for our products. Let's turn to slide four and review our approach to mitigate the effects from these headwinds. Currently, all of our major manufacturing sites are operating. In response to lower demand for certain products, we temporarily idled production at several small plants in our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment serving automotive end-markets and appropriately decreased production rates and other plans to match reduced end-market demand. Industry consultants estimate that petrochemical and refining assets in various parts of the world are running at 60% to 80% of nameplate capacity. We expect that the majority of LyondellBasell's capacity will also operate within that range during the second quarter. Our manufacturing operations have been declared as an essential industry, supporting society's needs to fight the pandemic in the majority of the regions in which we operate. We implemented best practices recommended by medical professionals and governmental bodies to protect our employees, contractors, assets, and the communities where we operate around the world, while maintaining business continuity with our customers and suppliers. Since the activation of our global pandemic response team in late January, we instituted social distancing practices, escalated our sanitization protocols, and increased employee health monitoring at all of our manufacturing sites. Our office-based employees worked productively from home as the pandemic spread from Asia to Europe then to the Americas. We are implementing processes to enable a safe and full return to workplaces as conditions permit around the world. The majority of our 1,000 employees in China are now back in our plants and offices. I want to thank and acknowledge our over 19,000 LyondellBasell employees for their tireless innovation, dedication, and sense of ownership they have exhibited for our company during these difficult times. Since the full extent of the pandemic, the drop in oil prices and the economic downturn remains uncertain. We are acting on strategies to respond to a range of economic scenarios. Over the past few quarters, we have been working on meaningful cost-saving initiatives across the company. Those initiatives have been accelerated. In response to falling demand, we instituted more aggressive inventory management policies. When combined with lower prices for raw materials and products, we expect these actions will provide a meaningful release of cash from working capital, during 2020. In order to reduce operational and financial risk, we postponed selected growth projects and planned maintenance, including slowing construction activities, on our PO/TBA plant. We currently expect these actions will reduce 2020 capital expenditures by approximately 20%, from our prior guidance of $2.4 billion to our current outlook of $1.9 billion. During April, strong demand for our investment-grade bonds enabled us to increase liquidity by $2 billion, with a successful offering that resulted in the lowest U.S. dollar interest rates in the history of our company. We remain confident that our resilient cash generation and disciplined approach to capital deployment will serve us well during these challenging times. Our focus on funding the dividend, while remaining committed to a strong investment-grade balance sheet, plays an integral role to our shareholder value proposition. We believe that our actions to reduce operating costs, capital expenditures and working capital will generate sufficient free cash flow over the coming quarters. In the event of a prolonged or deeper downturn, we will act pragmatically and evaluate all prudent options. In March, lower oil prices and reduced demand for transportation fuels, negatively impacted both volumes and margins for our Refining segment and our Oxyfuels & Related Products business within the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Global shutdowns by automotive manufacturers, sharply reduced demand for our polypropylene compounds within the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Consumer-driven demand for polyolefins used in packaging and health care products, supported relatively stable integrated polyethylene margins, in the Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. Lower feedstock prices resulted in higher integrated polyethylene margins for our O&P \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. While we expect that demand for durable goods will take some time to recover lasting changes in consumer lifestyles may have beneficial mid-term implications for some of our large end-use markets. On slide 5, we show some recent North American market research that suggests changes in consumer buying habits that could endure beyond the current crisis. As you may have experienced consumer stockpiled home pantries as it became clear that societal restrictions were required to slow the spread of the virus. LyondellBasell felt this surge for our polymers used in consumer packaging to safely deliver food, medicines and other essential products to households around the world. The need for plastic packaging increased as society moved from bulk volumes used in workplaces and restaurants, towards smaller package sizes delivered and consumed in the home. Excessive demand for paper goods has subsided. And thankfully most stockpiles of home health care products do not require replenishment. But lifestyle changes are creating a new normal as consumer-based demand for frozen, dairy and packaged food has risen by approximately 30%. Surveys indicate that after staying at home during the pandemic, 40% of Americans plan to increase the amount of time they work from home and 65% intend to eat at home, more often. These changes are likely to increase demand for the polyolefin packaging that is typically used in these applications. Let's turn to slide 6 and review our recent safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to health and safety has become even more relevant to our employees, contractors and communities, during the pandemic. Our employees have continued to deliver top quartile, if not top decile safety performance, despite numerous potential distractions through these difficult times. Earlier, I mentioned our precautionary measures to increase the frequency and intensity of our workplace, sanitization, social distancing practices, health monitoring and self-reporting processes, to reduce the spread of the virus among our workforce. Our processes have proven effective, with limited virus spread across our global employee population. LyondellBasell's manufacturing operations have been designated as an essential industry to support society's needs during the pandemic. Let's turn to slide 7, where we highlight LyondellBasell's role in supplying vital products that support health care, hygiene and medical needs. For example, our polypropylene resins are used by customers to produce melt-blown fibers that provide filtration in face masks. Our masterbatch products are used to produce breathable films. Our polyethylene is used for protective clothing, draping and medical packaging. And our polypropylene, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are used to make syringes, tubing, test kits, soaps, disinfectants, medical devices and many other products. With that I will turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial performance. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8 illustrates our relatively consistent cash flow performance over the past five years. Over the last 12 months, 90% of our EBITDA translated into cash from operating activities. With approximately $1 billion dedicated to maintaining our assets, our free operating cash flow remained relatively healthy at $3.8 billion. As you heard from Bob, we are putting a significant amount of focus on cash generation and liquidity. Now please turn to Slide 9, where we provide further details on cash generation for the first quarter. You can see that our business has generated $500 million of cash from operating activities during the first quarter, down just over $100 million from one year ago. During the first quarter, we increased our cash on hand to $1.8 billion in an abundance of caution with borrowings from our revolving credit, accounts receivable and commercial paper facilities. Capital expenditures were approximately $660 million, as we continue to move forward on our PO/TBA plant. In the first quarter, we paid $351 million in dividends to our shareholders. As Bob mentioned, we have developed strategies to respond to a variety of economic scenarios. Slide 10 outlines the actions we have taken to maximize liquidity. We are increasing cash inflows by accelerating cost-saving initiatives and reducing working capital. At the end of March we had $3.2 billion in liquidity. We further bolstered this liquidity through the successful issuance of $2 billion in senior notes in April at very attractive long-term rates. With the slowdown of our PO/TBA plant construction, postponement of growth projects and some deferral of planned maintenance will reduce our 2020 capital expenditures by $500 million relative to our prior guidance. In the current uncertain environment, we will prioritize liquidity over share repurchases and any potential M&A activities. We have a strong balance sheet and a favorable maturity profile. Slide 11 illustrates the maturities of our long-term debt portfolio after the April 2020 bond issuance. Proceeds from the issuance will be utilized for general corporate purposes including increasing our liquidity and managing shorter-term debt maturities. With the addition of the new bonds, our weighted average cost of debt remains about 3.8%. Long-term debt due in 2022 includes $500 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility in the first quarter. This borrowing along with other short-term borrowings were repaid in April from existing cash and proceeds from our recent bond offering. Our bonds have a well-balanced maturity profile that reduces refinancing risk in any given year and the company benefits from a good mix of both dollar and euro-denominated debt. Before I turn the call over to Bob, please turn to Slide 12 and allow me to provide an update on the annual financial modeling guidance that we discussed last quarter. As we mentioned, we are reducing our 2020 plan for capital expenditures by $500 million to $1.9 billion. Approximately $200 million of the reduction is associated with profit-generating projects with the majority coming from the reduced pace of construction at our new PO/TBA facility. The reduced spending will become evident during the second half of this year. We remain committed to the completion of our strategic investment in the PO/TBA project and will resume full activities at the appropriate time. The remaining $300 million of the capital expenditure reduction is primarily associated with postponements and our planned maintenance schedule. In addition to CapEx savings, we no longer anticipate EBITDA impacts the business associated with major planned maintenance activities for the second half of 2020. We previously provided a cash interest estimate for 2020. We thought it easier for you to model using our interest expense for 2020, which is expected to be $410 million. This includes a credit for capitalized interest of approximately $45 million. 2020 annual depreciation and amortization continues to be forecast at $1.5 billion. We are reducing our plan for pension contributions in 2020 by $40 million to approximately $80 million and our pension expense remains estimated at $100 million. We are reducing our estimated 2020 effective tax rate from about 20% to an expectation in the mid-teens. The cash tax rate is expected to remain in the mid- to high-teens. The lower effective rate is related to both lower profitability and favorable impacts from the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security or CARES Act. The CARES Act resulted in a higher first quarter tax expense due to a revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities that was discrete to the first quarter. The net impact of the CARES Act to the full year is expected to be favorable. With that I will turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob? Bob Patel : Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 13 and review our first quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the noncash LCM inventory charges. Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continue to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.1 billion. Profitability for both the Olefins and Polyolefins Americas and O&P, Europe, Asia and International segments were supported by our capability to switch amongst low-cost feedstocks and robust polymer demand from consumer-driven packaging and medical applications. Our Refining segment and the Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses within the I&D segment faced challenging market conditions created by reduced margins and demand for transportation fuels. The resiliency of our business portfolio continues to benefit from our relatively high participation in consumer-driven demand for nondurable products and a diverse global manufacturing footprint. Slide 14 highlights our differential feedstock flexibility relative to our peers at both our United States and European ethylene cracker assets. We can leverage the most economical feedstocks with respect to raw material costs and prices yielded from products. In North America, our two Midwest crackers in Clinton and Morris were built to utilize low cost stranded ethane and propane. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, three of our crackers can utilize the full range of feedstocks, ethane, propane, butane, Y-grade, mixed NGLs, condensate and naphtha, while the fourth cracker can flex amongst the most economical NGLs. This allows us to respond to feedstock prices and alleviate demand pressure on any one of the feedstocks. Our cracker system offers distinct advantages relative to new build crackers that can only run ethane. In a similar way, we have improved our flexibility in Europe with capabilities to run slightly more than 50% of our P28 using LPGs and other potentially advantaged raw materials. On slide 15, we highlight how this feedstock flexibility can provide advantaged margins for LyondellBasell. Integrated polyethylene margins in North America fluctuated in the first quarter as the advantage fee shifted from ethane, propane and butane to naphtha as the price of oil fell during March. We are able to follow the most economical feedstock to maximize profitability by switching among the raw materials used in our flexible crackers. In Europe, integrated polyethylene margins in March were the highest we have seen since 2015. We've been able to maximize value across naphtha, propane, butane and other advantaged feeds. With significant asset bases in both Europe and North America, LyondellBasell's overall results are less volatile than if our business was reliant upon only one region. With our feedstock flexibility in mind, let's review our first quarter results starting with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on slide 16. First quarter EBITDA was $477 million, $46 million lower than the fourth quarter. Profitability was driven by robust demand for polymers used in consumer packaging and medical applications, which supported improved polyethylene price spreads over ethylene monomer. Olefins results decreased approximately $110 million compared to the fourth quarter. Margins declined on lower ethylene sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in feedstock prices. Ethylene operating rates fell to about 87% for the quarter due to a planned maintenance turnaround for one of the two crackers at our ChannelView facility. Polyolefin results increased about $95 million during the first quarter, driven by an improvement in polyethylene price spread over ethylene of more than $105 per ton, primarily due to lower ethylene costs. During the first quarter, we advanced on our growth initiatives by launching production at our 500,000 ton per year Hyperzone high-density Polyethylene plant here on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our Hyperzone Polyethylene technology provides differential products for applications such as water pipes, industrial drums and intermediate bulk containers. We expect a more challenging second quarter with the unprecedented market conditions as a backdrop. While lower feedstock prices could reduce costs, uncertainties around oil price and weaker underlying demand could reduce polyolefins prices and volumes. Industry consultants predict that U.S. crackers will operate at approximately 75% of nameplate capacity during the second quarter and our assets are expected to operate in a similar range. Now please turn to slide 17 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $225 million, $81 million higher than the fourth quarter. Profitability was driven by lower feedstock prices, increased reliability and higher volumes. Olefins results increased more than $135 million, driven by an increase in ethylene margin due to lower prices for naphtha and other feedstocks. Volumes increased as cracker operating rates rose to 95% for the quarter due to improved reliability. Combined polyolefins results were comparable to the previous quarter. Polyethylene volume increased 15% over the fourth quarter, with increased consumer-driven demand for packaging, due to stay-at-home orders. Polyolefins margins declined, offsetting the improvement in volume. Reductions in both margins and volumes across our joint ventures contributed to a decline in equity income of approximately $35 million. We expect the second quarter to follow similar trends as the Americas with the benefits from lower feedstock costs muted by lower demand. Our European crackers are expected to operate at 80% to 85% of nameplate capacity during the second quarter. Please turn to slide 18. Let's take a look at our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $281 million, a $48 million decrease versus the prior quarter. Results were affected by a significant decline in gasoline demand that severely impacted oxyfuels margins beginning in February. First quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to higher volumes and margins. Intermediate Chemicals increased $15 million, driven by an increase in acetyl margins. Volumes were lower due to planned maintenance at our Channelview methanol unit. Oxyfuels and Related Products results decreased approximately $80 million, as a result of lower product prices. During February and March, Oxyfuels margins declined with weaker gasoline demand as global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders became more widespread. We expect further declines for the segment into Q2, as lackluster demand for propylene oxide and polyurethane applications and continued pressure on oxyfuels demand and margins will likely persist through the second quarter. On slide 19, let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. First quarter EBITDA was $115 million $53 million higher than the fourth quarter. Volumes and margins increased with typical seasonal improvements that were muted by pandemic-related shutdowns in automotive end-markets. First quarter pre-tax integration costs were $14 million. Compounding & Solutions results increased approximately $30 million due to higher margins and volumes. Seasonal volume improvements were partially offset by declines in automotive end-market demand during March. Advanced Polymers results increased about $10 million supported by improved seasonal construction demand. Our team is making continued progress on the integration efforts related to the 2018 acquisition of A. Schulman. Integration activities are on schedule to achieve $200 million in forward annual run rate synergies by the third quarter of this year. During the second quarter we expect profitability for the segment to be increasingly impacted by severe reductions in demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end-markets. As I mentioned, we have temporarily idled production at several of our small plants in response to manufacturing plant closures across the automotive industry. Now let's turn to slide 20 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was negative $80 million, $102 million decline versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Results were driven by a decline in crack spreads and an unplanned outage on our fluidized catalytic cracker unit. In the first quarter the MAYA 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread decreased to an average of $17.21 per barrel for the quarter. Unplanned maintenance at our Houston Refinery reduced the average crude throughput by over 40,000 barrels per day to 226,000 barrels per day for the quarter. The refining market has been challenged by falling prices and demand for transportation fuels, including gasoline and jet fuel. We anticipate that these factors will continue to pressure our refining results, until societal restrictions ease and demand for transportation fuels returns to typical levels later in the year. Our fluid catalytic cracker unit at the refinery returned to service in late April and we are currently operating the refinery at 85% to 90% of nameplate crude throughput. Please turn to slide 21, as we review the results of our Technology segment. During the first quarter, Technology segment EBITDA was $56 million, a decrease of $82 million compared to the record results from the fourth quarter of 2019. Catalyst volumes and margins remained steady, while licensing revenue declined due to fewer revenue milestones during the quarter. Our Technology segment licenses polymer production technologies for new manufacturing plants that enable subsequent catalyst sales to licensing customers over the lifetime of the asset. Individual contract terms and the timing of project milestones results in an uneven pace for licensing revenues. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming milestones, we expect that second quarter licensing profitability will return to the higher levels of recent quarters. Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook with slide 22. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged assets continued to deliver resilient results. Our foundations in leveraging our feedstock flexibility, with our low operating costs and high asset utilization serves us well during any point in the cycle. We remain consistent with our capital deployment strategy that supports our dividend with efficient cash generation and disciplined allocation of capital expenditures for required maintenance and profit-generating growth projects. All decisions are grounded by our commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating. We anticipate that challenges from the coronavirus pandemic and plummeting oil prices that arose during the first quarter will extend for much of the year. Demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually rebound as various regions emerge from societal restrictions return to work and regain comfort with prior travel patterns. Markets for discretionary durable goods will likely take longer to recover from the downturn. We expect that robust consumer-driven demand for our products in packaging and medical applications will continue. LyondellBasell is addressing these challenges by proactively reducing costs working capital and capital expenditures, while prioritizing and increasing liquidity. Our company is really well positioned to navigate these challenging markets and emerge stronger with the eventual rebound of the global economy. We will now please take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question in the queue from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. John McNulty : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess when we look at this recession it's different than past ones, because of the quarantining and the impact of that or the compounding effect of that. It seems like when the quarantining starts to end there's a couple of your businesses Refining & Oxyfuels that should kind of snap back pretty quickly. But how should we think about the rest of the businesses and the potential impact that maybe the quarantine is having on it where you might as that ends start to get relief maybe earlier than just the broader macro? Is there a way to think about that? Bob Patel : Yeah, John. Good morning. The way we think about it is we have packaging and medical which is probably nearly half of the company essentially; and then durable goods auto is probably about 20%, 25%; and then the fuels and oxyfuels and so on is the remainder. I think that, we should see demand improve even further, if the economies are opened, because typically in the summertime as you know we see seasonal effects and we see increases in demand. So relatively speaking, we could see more of that on the packaging side. And on fuels you said it rightly that as people get on the road and drive more our oxyfuels and refining business should improve. So kind of the way we're thinking about it is automobile production and demand will probably be the slowest to return. But it's a pretty small part of our business. Operator : The next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. If your Bora project the cracker and downstream polyethylene plant, if they were \u2013 if that was onstream today and you were able to receive naphtha as an internal transfer from your partner's refinery how would the integrated margin of that \u2013 complex compared to say your naphtha-based margins in Europe and your U.S. Gulf margins? Bob Patel : Yeah. Good morning, Steve. Indeed, if it was running, we'd have decent margins probably in the $400 to $500 per ton integrated basis range. You'll recall that, the thesis around that investment is about producing in China for China and the benefit of that project for us beyond getting a bigger position in China is that the timing of the investment will be such that when we make our capital infusion, it will be very close to start-up so within a quarter or two. But decent margins today, if it was running. Operator : Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David Begleiter : Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Hey, good morning, David. David Begleiter : Bob, just on polyethylene prices. Consultants said they fell $0.04 in April. Do you agree and they're calling for another $0.06 in May and June for combined $0.10 decline in Q2. Again do you agree? Do you think that's too severe? Bob Patel : Yeah, David. I think even the $0.04, I would say it's \u2013 that may be more of a headline number as opposed to kind of realized when you look through all of the different end-use segments that we supply. In terms of the outlook with ethane price rising like it has, difficult to imagine that you'd have that, kind of, a large step down. And again as I mentioned earlier, on the demand side, packaging related demand is still very good. We're coming into the summer season. And as different state economies in the U.S. start to open and outdoor activities actually are safer than indoor activities and that drives packaging demand. So if we see some increase in demand seasonally, it seems to me that we have a decent market environment. And in our case, we're running our assets in olefins and polyolefins in the U.S. at about 70% today. So pretty decent rate given the environment we're in. Operator : Next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open Vincent Andrews : Thanks, and good morning everyone. Bob, wondering if you could talk a bit about the concern that's out there that with -- lower oil prices will have less associated gas production, and therefore less NGL production. So as gas does go above $3, $3.50 wherever it goes, what do you think happens to ethane and propane prices? Bob Patel : Yeah. So Vincent in terms of ethane supply/demand, we're all working to get our arms around what could happen. But here's the way I think about it. First of all, there's quite a bit that's being rejected today, maybe as much as 350,000 barrels a day of ethane being rejected. So, of course, that rejection would get shut off. And then in times past what we've seen is, if ethane is still snug and values rise especially in the low oil price environment, you'd see feedstock flexibility kick in. And a company like us, which who have a lot of feedstock flexibility, we would tilt more towards liquids and LPGs. And beyond that, some of the exports could even get shut off for ethane. So it seems to me that what we're really trying to think through is could we have another spike as opposed to a sustained period of high ethane prices. Because in the end, we continue to believe that there's an abundance of ethane available in the U.S. and higher prices will just attract more investment and more supply of ethane over the long-term. So it's more about thinking through transitory effects. And I think a company like ours that has so much feedstock flexibility; we can manage through that probably better than most. Operator : Next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Hope you're all well. I guess, I just wanted to ask about polypropylene. So when you look at supply/demand and what's going on with the compounding and automotive, would you expect -- and then also feedstocks as well. Would you expect any capacity reductions in polypropylene over the next year or two? Maybe just your comment on your outlook for polypropylene? Thanks. Bob Patel : Yeah. Arun, it could be that some of the high-cost capacity in Europe or U.S. is idled. But more importantly what we've observed so far is projects are starting to get delayed, excluding China. But elsewhere in the world, if you look up in North America and other parts of the world those are the first signs of change. And frankly we're seeing that even in polyethylene. So one of the outcomes of the period that we're going through is delays in new construction. And I certainly see that in polypropylene. Operator : Next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open. P.J. Juvekar: Hey, Bob, good to hear from you. Bob Patel : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Good morning. Just a quick question. Given the planned shutdowns globally, where are your inventories of polyethylene and polypropylene? Where are they for the industry? And in this type of environment usually converters begin to destock anticipating lower prices. Where do we stand on that? And what, kind of, working capital do you expect to release given lower raw materials, lower inventories et cetera? Thank you. Bob Patel : Yeah. Thank you, P.J. Well, inventory reduction has been a very, very high focus for us over the last 75 days or so. We started reducing inventories back in late February and early March. And so today for our polyolefins, we're sitting at 30 days or so of inventory based on lower demand rates. So we've already adjusted for anticipated lower demand rate and we'll continue to do that. And essentially what we're doing is, we're short cycling our product wheel to preferentially produce the products where there's high demand. And only produce to order be in areas where we believe there's low demand or low visibility on demand. And your question about working capital reduction and cash release, we expect about $500 million of cash release from lower working capital as we work our way through this year. Most of that benefit should come through in Q2 with a little bit of tailing benefit in Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning, Bob. You know, one of the effects of the pandemic seems to be rapidly changing consumer and government attitudes towards single-use plastics. What are you observing in that area? And do you anticipate any backlash reversion that would lead to a structural benefit in addition to the other sort of working and staying at home cooking at home benefits that you alluded to in the prepared remarks? Bob Patel : Hey. Good morning, Kevin. We do see some structural benefits, I think, accruing to both polyethylene and polypropylene for some time given what's happened. Reversal of bag bans on the West Coast on the East Coast those could stay for a while. I think what people are realizing is that there are very significant hygienic benefits to plastics and that single-use has benefits. The key thing that we have to remember that won't change is that the challenge of plastic waste still remains. And I can tell you that we as a company have not lost our focus on that. And I think as an industry the focus on plastic waste, addressing, recycling, increasing capture of waste before it gets in the environment that's something that we should continue our focus on as an industry and we certainly will continue as a company. And then as single-use applications increase in demand, I think, society can be confident that that single-use waste won't end up in the environment. So plastic waste will continue to be an area of emphasis for us. Operator : Next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bob, you mentioned that benchmark margins for ethylene polyethylene in Europe were fairly high close to record. At the same time, your EBITDA was up sequentially, but below 2019 and 2019 averages. So A, could you explain why that is? And B, if these benchmarks decline in the second quarter should your EBITDA decline less than the benchmark would apply? Bob Patel : Well so, Aleksey it's probably more about timing during the quarter in terms of the margins. In Europe as the oil price decline, we did see a margin expansion. And that's very typical in Europe. And I think it speaks to again the diversity of our asset base. And in a lower oil price environment we generally see better contribution from our European assets. We likely will see some margin erosion in Europe as we work through Q2 and as things normalize a bit more and the new, sort of, lower oil price environment sets in. We do expect some margin erosion in Europe. But demand is decent in Europe. Frankly, we're running our O&P assets at about 80% in Europe today. And as economies over there open up, we think that going into the summer season we could run at pretty good rates in this 80% to 85% range through the summer. Operator : Next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, folks. Question just around the differential between say U.S. ethane-based and kind of European and Asian naphtha-based. Obviously, as oils come down on paper at least those two regions look extremely competitive. How quickly do you think as they ramp up some of their production rates do you think the by-products from the naphtha will start to readjust to lower levels? So the propylenes, the benzene, the butadienes that kind of stuff. Can you walk through how you see that playing out the rest of this year? Bob Patel : Yes. Hey, good morning. Duffy, actually the byproduct disposition is already playing out. And C4 is -- butadienes containment is a real challenge. And so our strategy is that we don't want to build inventory on butadiene. And so we'll crack liquids up to a point where we can move the butadiene and I think that's already globally been restricting the amount of naphtha that's being cracked. And so we've had -- over the past 10 years, I was thinking about this that we've had probably two or three periods like this where a coproduct disposition became a challenge. Typically, it doesn't last that long. And in the current environment some automobile production coming back and people driving and replacing tires should provide some relief. But, I think, it will continue to be a constraint through most of this year, especially, disposition of butadiene. And again our strategy even in the U.S. where we have significant feedstock flexibility, we will maximize liquids up to a point where we're not building inventory of C4s. Operator : Next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Dylan Campbell : Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. Dylan Campbell : A question kind of on the cash flow profile. You mentioned kind of working capital improvement. Would you be able to size that at any degree in terms of how much of those are your intrinsic improvements versus the decline in oil prices? And then also on CapEx, what kind of $1.1 billion of growth CapEx still embedded in the total CapEx number for the year? Is there further room for that to decline this year? Bob Patel : Yeah. Hey, good morning, Dylan. Let me answer the question in terms of how we're -- the actions we've taken to increase cash flow. So as I mentioned earlier, working capital release we expect to be about $500 million, mostly in Q2 with some trailing benefits in Q3. CapEx, we've reduced on a cash basis by about $500 million from $2.4 billion to $1.9 billion. Most of that $500 million benefit will be evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. In addition to that, we've undertaken -- we've accelerated our cost-reduction initiatives that we started in September of last year. We expect those to provide additional benefit this year on a cash basis of between $150 million and $200 million. So when you kind of total all that up, between the working capital the CapEx and the cash basis cost reduction, we expect that we should boost cash flow this year by about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and the timing will start in Q2 through the end of the year. Operator : Next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Sison : Hey, guys. Hey, Bob. How you\u2019re doing? Bob Patel : Hey, good morning. Mike Sison : Just sort of a longer-term question. When you think about your EBITDA in olefins both Americas and EAI, I think you're going to be down this year right, and given a lot of the challenges that we have in the economy. So when you think about in a better volume environment hopefully over time and rebuilding that margin over time. Can you maybe walk us through the variables between oil, and how much volume recovery comes back in terms of your EBITDA maybe on a more normalized EBITDA margin basis longer term? Bob Patel : Yeah. I mean I think in the near term Mike, we have decent visibility here with Q2 and into Q3. Q4 all of us are keeping an eye on whether we're going to have another wave of the virus or not. And it's an unknown. It's something that's difficult to predict. But if I look beyond the pandemic and look beyond the current period of low oil prices, I mean if history is an indicator, typically oil prices do rebound within 24 months. Now, at the moment we also have a lot of inventory to work through. So, we're not expecting significant improvement in oil price for most of this year. But I do think that if you were to look 24 months out, you could see oil prices at higher levels. Likely, we'll also see project delays and cancellations, and I think -- and some demand improvement, benefit from pent-up demand, which should set up a very good supply/demand environment 24 months out -- 12 to 24 months out. But our focus is to make sure that we maximize cash flow and maximize liquidity in the near term. And make sure that we keep our focus on the long-term projects that we've initiated. Operator : Next question is from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now open. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, gentlemen. I'm glad to hear you're all doing well. Bob Patel : Good morning, Frank. Michael McMurray : Good morning. Frank Mitsch : Hey, Bob, you mentioned that all the major plants are running although some of the smaller plants in APS are idle. I'm just curious I assume you looked at perhaps idling some polyethylene capacity as others have. What do you come out on the pros and cons of doing that? And what would be the likelihood that Lyondell would go that route? Bob Patel : Yeah. We don't -- Frank we haven't really seen demand decline to a level where we would consider idling polyethylene capacity. So our sense is that here in April, we're kind of seeing a near-term bottom in demand, because I would imagine that as economies partially reopen directionally that should help on the demand side. And as I was stating earlier on one of the other questions that in a partial lockdown or reduced mobility mode for the rest of the year perhaps, we think that packaging is a beneficiary of that. So our expectation is that in the U.S., we're going to run kind of 70%, 80% across our assets. And olefins and polyolefins in Europe 80%, 85%, and we don't really foresee needing to idle for a long period of time in the polyethylene. Operator : Next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Bob when you contemplate the experience of Lyondell, both in its business performance and its share price during the current recession, does it change your view concerning the distribution of dividend increase and share repurchase in the future for Lyondell? That is do you think that your behavior in allocating your free cash flow in the future will change because of your experience this year? Bob Patel : Yes. Thank you for that question Jeff. Well in the near term, as I mentioned, given lack of visibility in terms of the outlook beyond Q3, really our priorities are to maximize liquidity. In terms of capital allocation, we're very consistent in our view that the dividend is a high priority for us coupled with a strong BBB or investment-grade rating, which today is BBB for us. So I don't expect that we would undertake buybacks given that we're prioritizing liquidity. Our dividend we expect that we will recommend the May dividend to our Board. We expect that they'll approve that dividend for Q2. Given the visibility that we have and the improvements we've made in terms of working capital CapEx and the cash cost savings, we think that we can largely cover the dividend for the full year. And I think your question we'll be in a better position to answer when we get to later in the year about capital allocation. Today, the priority is maximize liquidity, maximize cash flow and all of those will allow us to continue -- enable us to continue to pay the dividend largely from operating cash flow for the balance of the year. Operator : Next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Jonas Oxgaard : Thank you. A question on the refining of the oxyfuels. It seems that the main issues right now is because of the lack of fuel demand. So can you give us an idea for what should those businesses look like after the lockdown is over? Crude is still $30 $40 probably. But we're driving again. Bob Patel : Yes. So in refining Jonas, the light-heavy differential is a very, very significant driver for earnings followed by diesel cracks. Our refinery given that it's a heavy crude oil processing refinery and we make a significant amount of coke as a result, in this environment, it actually favors our refinery because of the amount of diesel that we produce. We've mentioned in prior earnings calls and other venues that we expect that our refinery under more normalized conditions should earn about $100 million in EBITDA per quarter. It will be a challenge to get to that level this year because we still need more supply of sour crude oil. But we do think that the higher level of diesel production as a portion of the total yield favors us in our refinery. In oxyfuels, we should start to see some benefits from the volume rising. Higher oil price also helps in terms of oxyfuel profitability. So both should directionally improve as the lockdowns are eased and as activity at least daily activity returns to more normal levels. Operator : Next question is from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thank you. I'm glad you're all so well. If you were able to switch to 100% heavy feedstocks, would you be able to place all of the extra coproducts in this soft market? Bob Patel : Yes. No, we would not be able to do that. And again, butadiene would be probably our greatest challenge today and it's what limits us in terms of how much liquids we can crack. Our capability, we had two crackers at ChannelView that produce about 4 billion pounds of ethylene in total. We can crack all liquids at those two crackers. And in terms of our Corpus Christi cracker, we can crack about two-thirds non-ethane feed. So we have significant flexibility. But today, we could not place all the C4s. And as I said earlier, we do not intend to build inventory. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning, Bob, glad to hear you are safe and sound. I just had a question. Could you compare polypropylene demand with PE demand? Which is holding up better and why? Bob Patel : Yeah, good morning, Matthew good to hear from you. They're both resilient for different reasons. In polyethylene, the areas of weakness have been around construction, but we expect that that's more seasonal and that will pick up. In polypropylene, it's more about auto being weak. But on the other hand, it's been offset by the melt-blown-type of products that are going into PPE for first responders and there's quite a bit of packaging in polypropylene. If I really had to call one or the other, I would say maybe on the margin polypropylene is a little bit weaker than polyethylene, just because of the auto content. But both are holding up pretty well. And as I mentioned earlier, we're running our assets at 70% plus here in the U.S. Michael McMurray : And Matthew, the only other thing I would add is the export market from North America for polyethylene isn't as strong as it was earlier in the year. So that's a particular weakness here in the second quarter anyways until China starts producing for the rest of the world again. Operator : The final question in the queue is from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Bob. Bob Patel : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Bob I wanted to revisit some of the comments you made about your dividend. Having taken a glance at the 10-K, it seems that, as I take a look at the covenants and the like, that if LTM EBITDA -- net debt-to-EBITDA sort of approaches or exceeds 3.5 times. I guess, the verbiage was that there are certain restrictions that are put on dividend outlay. So, obviously LTM kind of looking fairly sort of decent right now, but if this pandemic or certain lockdowns were to last longer if there was COVID-related sort of lockdowns to pop up later on, as we go through the course of the year. Maybe, if we start approaching LTM levels of I'd say close to $3 million slightly north of $3 billion dividend start becoming a bit more questionable, just wanted to sort of hear your thoughts about that. Bob Patel : Yeah. You know Hassan EBITDA levels, at the kind of levels, you're describing would be extremely low. But I'll invite Michael to comment on the covenants. Michael McMurray : Yeah. So one thing to keep in mind in regards to the covenants, so you're right, it was -- there is a covenant related to total debt-to-EBITDA at greater than 3.5 times. You'll note from some recent filings, if you've gone through them, we decided it was prudent to actually get credit for cash on sheet. And so instead of a total debt it's now a net debt covenant. So again as Bob said that outlook from an EBITDA perspective is pretty dire and it would probably have to continue for some period of time. And then -- but I did want to point out that we actually did get some covenant relief as well, going from total debt to net debt. Bob Patel : Okay. Good. Well, thank you for all your questions. I'd like to close with a few comments. As I mentioned earlier we're anticipating and we're ready to address continued challenges as we progress through the current year. Our consistent focus on cash generation disciplined capital allocation will serve us well, in this challenging environment. We're leveraging our leading portfolio, advantaged positions to extend our track record of strong cash generation, profitable growth initiatives and prudent financial policies to deliver sustainable value for you our shareholders. So we thank you for your interest in our company. And look forward to updating you in July, on our second quarter results. So with that, we're adjourned. Have a great weekend. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's Second Quarter 2020 Teleconference. I am joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. We will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until September 1 by calling (800) 879-4299 in the United States and (203) 369-3561 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 7410. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower op cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last-in, first-out or LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the second quarter, we've recognized pretax LCM benefits totaling $96 million compared to LCM charges of $419 million in the first quarter. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. I hope that you, your colleagues and your families are all staying healthy during these challenging times. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. LyondellBasell's employees leveraged our core strengths in operational excellence, cost management and commercial agility to generate $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities during an extremely challenging quarter. This represents an improvement of over $100 million relative to the second quarter of 2019 despite our significantly lower earnings. During the second quarter, our team rapidly responded to weakening market conditions by aggressively reducing inventory to match lower levels of demand that reduced cash working capital by $575 million. We developed plans to reduce CapEx by approximately $500 million during the year. This includes slowing down of our PO/TBA project. We also made significant progress on cost-reduction efforts towards our goal of a run rate of $150 million to $200 million in recurring annual savings by the end of this year. We have quickly adapted to changing conditions in our markets, workplaces and communities to ensure that our assets continue to operate safely and serve the dynamic needs of our customers. LyondellBasell's products support many of society's critical needs such as melt-blown fibers for N95 face masks, alcohols for sanitizers and packaging that prevents the contamination and spoilage of our food I'm very thankful for the innovative thinking, tireless dedication and disciplined approach to health and safety exhibited by our employees around the world to ensure that we continue to serve our customers and protect our communities during these difficult times. Our second quarter EBITDA of nearly $700 million represents a decline of nearly 40% relative to the first quarter and almost 60% relative to the second quarter of last year. These results are reflective of pandemic-driven declines in demand and margins across many of the markets we serve, especially in transportation fuels and products used in automotive manufacturing and other durable goods end markets. Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to health and safety has become even more relevant to our employees, contractors and communities during the coronavirus pandemic. We leveraged the early experience from our employees in the Asia Pacific region to develop protocols for workplace sanitization, facial covering, social distancing, health screening and contact tracing to minimize the spread of virus across our global facilities. Although we have limited influence in our surrounding communities, our processes have proven highly effective in limiting virus spread within our workplaces. Our employees have continued to deliver top-quartile, if not top-decile, safety performance while adopting these additional pandemic-related protocols. In June, our company was honored to receive the American Chemistry Council's highest distinction the Responsible Care Company of the Year award. The award recognized our innovative practices and leadership in the areas of environmental, health, safety and security. This honor is a direct reflection of the dedication of our entire LyondellBasell team and their work to ensure that the health and safety of our people and the communities where we operate are always our highest priorities. The pandemic has generated a renewed appreciation for the value of our chemical and polymer products for society. At the same time, LyondellBasell has not retreated from our commitment to developing circular and sustainable business models for our products. Let's turn to Slide 5, where we highlight our progress on molecular recycling. LyondellBasell's mechanical recycling business model is focused on forming partnerships with waste management companies who can clean and sort plastic waste, enabling the production of premium recycled plastics. Nonetheless, we recognize that many plastic products are composed of multiple materials that cannot be easily sorted in the pure waste streams.  Late last year, we announced our initiative to develop a new proprietary technology called MoReTec to convert mixed plastic waste into a feedstock we could use in our existing assets to produce new chemicals and polymers. On Slide 5, you can see we have already scaled up this technology from the laboratory to a pilot plant that we commissioned during July in Ferrara, Italy. Our aim is to advance our catalyzed process technology to an industrial scale that will enable the production of monomer feedstock from waste plastic that is competitive with naphtha-based economics. MoReTec could provide another option for satisfying growing demand for circular plastics produced without fossil-based feedstocks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial performance. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our company continued to generate substantial cash during the second quarter. Slide 6 illustrates our cash flow performance over the past 5 years. During this time, we have consistently generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities on an annual basis. Over the last 12 months, more than 110% of our EBITDA was converted into cash from operating activities. With approximately $1.1 billion of capital expenditures dedicated to maintaining our assets and $5 billion in cash from operating activities, our free operating cash flow yield remained strong at 17.6%. Our team is aggressively managing inventories through dynamic markets while prioritizing cash generation and liquidity. Now please turn to Slide 7, where we provide further details on cash generation during the second quarter. You can see that our businesses generated $1.3 billion cash from operating activities, up more than $100 million from 1 year ago, despite our significantly lower earnings. During the second quarter, we increased our cash on hand to $3.2 billion with a $2 billion bond issuance in April at very attractive rates. Capital expenditures of $588 million declined more than 10% compared to the first quarter as we began to slow activities on the PO/TBA plant construction. In the second quarter, we paid $350 million in dividends to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $5.8 billion of cash and available liquidity. With strong cash generation and ample liquidity, we remain confident in our ability to fund our dividend, primarily from operating cash flows. As announced during the prior quarter, we rapidly developed strategies to respond to a variety of economic scenarios. Slide 8 illustrates our actions to reduce capital expenditures in 2020 by approximately $500 million. In addition to slowing the PO/TBA activities, we have also deferred planned maintenance during the pandemic. You may recall from our Investor Day last September that our plan was to reduce capital expenditures to $1.9 billion by 2022. We are accelerating this program and now plan to achieve this target 2 years ahead of schedule. Let's continue to Slide 9 and summarize the impact of these initiatives. The combination of lower capital expenditures, reduced discretionary spending and cash released from working capital is expected to improve our 2020 free cash flow by as much as $1.1 billion. We are also pursuing further optimization of our low-cost structure by accelerating cost-efficiency initiatives. With our disciplined approach to capital deployment and about $5.8 billion in cash and available liquidity, we believe the company is well positioned for this dynamic market environment. Before I turn the call over to Bob, allow me to provide an update on the annual financial modeling guidance that we discussed last quarter. We now expect that our 2020 effective tax rate will be lower than our previous guidance of a mid-teens percentage rate. The lower effective rate is related to both reduced profitability and favorable impacts from the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES Act. The net impact of the CARES Act on the company for the full year is expected to be favorable. The 2020 cash tax rate is expected to remain in line with our previously committed estimate of a mid- to high-teens percentage rate. With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob? Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review our second quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of these  LCM inventory changes. Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continue to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the second quarter was nearly $700 million. The global response to limit the spread of COVID-19 reduced demand and margins for many of our products. Our Olefin and Polyolefin segments rapidly responded to increased demand for our products used in consumer-driven packaging and health care while reducing production for polymers used in durable goods applications with falling demand. Our Intermediates and Derivatives, Refining and Advanced Polymer Solutions segments were impacted by the significant reduction in demand for transportation fuels and polymers utilized in automotive and other durable goods segments. The resiliency of our business portfolio continues to benefit from our relatively high participation in markets with consumer-driven demand for nondurable products and our global market reach. Let's review our second quarter results, starting with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 11. Second quarter EBITDA was $210 million, $267 million lower than the first quarter. The pandemic reduced demand for polyethylene from export markets and polyolefins for durable goods markets, resulting in margin and volume declines. Olefins results decreased approximately $230 million compared to the first quarter. Margins declined on lower coal product prices, particularly for butadiene and other C4s. As discussed in our first quarter call, we reduced our ethylene operating rates to about 75% of nameplate capacity for the second quarter to address weaker demand. Ethane made up 60% of our ethylene cracker feed slate during the quarter as weak demand for butadiene and other coal products offset the advantages of cracking low-priced naphtha feedstock. Polyolefins results decreased about $45 million during the second quarter, driven by declines in both margins and volumes. We believe the pandemic-driven declines in demand bottomed during the second quarter. We are seeing improvements in pricing and volumes as global economies reopen and demand for polyethylene exports and durable goods returns. We expect to operate our U.S. ethylene crackers at nearly full rates of 95% of nameplate capacity during the third quarter. With that, let's turn to Slide 12 and take a look at recent developments in feedstock costs around the world. As illustrated in the chart, during 2019, the cost of ethylene production in both North America and the Middle East remain highly advantaged relative to naphtha-based costs in Europe and the rest of the world. This has been the familiar shape of the global cost curve since U.S. shale oil and gas production came online over the prior decade. The small amount of ethylene produced by methanol to olefins technology in China is typically on the high end of the cost curve. In March and April, crude oil prices rapidly fell in response to both reduced fuel demand from the pandemic and increased crude production as Saudi Arabia and Russia sought to pressure higher-cost oil producers. When naphtha-based costs became favored during March and April, some speculated that the curve would have remained inverted, eliminating the U.S. shale gas advantage. As economies began reopening during May and June, the cost curve quickly regained slope and reasserted the advantage of Middle East and North American feedstocks. North America has an abundance of ethane and other natural gas liquid resources. While events may occasionally depress oil prices and temporarily invert the cost curve, we continue to believe that North American producers will typically have advantage for the foreseeable future. Looking at the polypropylene market on Slide 13. We are seeing indications of increased demand from the automotive market as well as continued strength in packaging orders. Approximately 15% of LyondellBasell's North American polypropylene business serves the automotive market by either providing base resins to our downstream Advanced Polymer Solutions segment or through direct sales to third-party manufacturers of vehicle components. In the first half of this year, automotive manufacturers shut down production to limit virus spread and then reopened, first in China, later in Europe, and then the United States. China's progress can be seen by June 2020 new vehicle tire demand that is 11% higher than the same month last year. In Europe and the U.S., June 2020 new vehicle production remains down by 31% and 26%, respectively, relative to pre-COVID forecasts. The progress in North American automotive demand for polypropylene can be seen in the chart on the right that tracks our order books for these applications. Demand has risen sharply during June and July as automotive manufacturers resumed production. In addition, LyondellBasell's polypropylene orders for consumer-driven packaging applications have remained at the elevated levels we have seen through the pandemic with 20% higher demand from packaging markets during the first half of the year. Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, EBITDA was $219 million, $6 million lower than the first quarter. Despite reduced demand as a result of the pandemic, integrated profit margins remained relatively stable.  Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million driven by a decrease in both margin and volume. Ethylene margin decreased as reductions in ethylene and pulp product prices outpaced declining feedstock costs. Volume decreased following strong production in the prior quarter, coupled with lower demand in the second quarter. Our European crackers operated at 84% of capacity during the quarter. Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million compared to the prior quarter. Margins improved and were partially offset by a decrease in polypropylene volumes due to reduced demand from automotive and other durable goods markets. Higher margins in our joint ventures contributed to an increase in equity income of approximately $55 million. Increased demand for melt-blown polypropylene used in N95 face masks and other medical applications drove improved demand and margins for our PolyMirae joint venture in South Korea. In the coming quarter, we expect margins to decrease due to higher feedstock costs. We expect that our European crackers will operate at about 90% of nameplate capacity during the third quarter as some of our competitors in the region are expected to be down for planned maintenance. Please turn to Slide 15 for an update of our new Chinese integrated cracker joint venture with Bora. Over the past few weeks, the construction team handed off the project to the operations team for commissioning during August. Although most of the ethylene feedstock will be naphtha supplied by our partner's adjacent refinery, the cracker also has flexibility to utilize LPG feedstocks from global sources, and this slide shows the first delivery of an LPG cargo to the cracker a few weeks ago in preparation for our start-up. Our equity contribution to the joint venture is expected to occur during the third quarter. This joint venture investment allows LyondellBasell to rapidly expand in the world's fastest-growing market for our products. Please turn to Slide 16. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $121 million, $160 million lower than the prior quarter. As we expected, second quarter results reflect a significant reduction in gasoline and other durable goods demand that impacted both margins and volume for oxyfuels and related products as well as propylene oxide and derivative volumes. Second quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased approximately $55 million due to lower volumes from reduced demand for polyurethanes in automotive, construction and furniture markets. Intermediate chemicals results were relatively flat. Oxyfuels and related products results decreased approximately $95 million as a result of lower margins and lower volumes. Margins were compressed by lower gasoline prices. Volumes declined due to lower demand for automotive fuels and isobutylene. We anticipate that demand for transportation fuels will improve in the third quarter. Profitability for our oxyfuels and related products business is expected to follow but not to the typical high levels we normally realize during the summer driving season. With that, let's turn to Slide 17 and look at some positive indicators in the demand for transportation fuels. In the U.S., stay-at-home closures largely occurred over the months of March and April, with the reopenings beginning in May. This can be seen in the chart as vehicle miles traveled bottomed during April. Summer driving and reopening increased vehicle mileage for June to be about 95% of what it was in February. In addition, increased consumption is reducing gasoline inventories, allowing for a gradual improvement in refinery operating rates. While we may need to moderate reopening progress to control virus spread, the trends support improving supply and demand balances for transportation fuels that should be constructive for profitability going forward. Now let's move on and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA was $23 million, $92 million lower than the first quarter. Volumes declined significantly as a result of pandemic-related shutdowns at automotive manufacturers. We temporarily idled production at several of our small compounding plants in the APS segment to respond to reduced demand. Second quarter pretax integration costs were $16 million. Compounding and solutions results decreased approximately $75 million due to lower volumes driven by decreased demand for polymer compounds from the automotive sector. Advanced Polymers results decreased about $10 million due to lower demand in the construction and automotive end markets. Automotive manufacturers partially resumed production at their facilities in the latter part of the second quarter. As a result, we expect third quarter profitability for the segment to benefit from returning demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end markets. During July, we restarted most of our idle plants, and we plan to operate our compounding capacity at rates that match downstream automotive demand. Now let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was negative $14 million, a $66 million improvement versus the first quarter of 2020. Results were pressured by a significant reduction in transportation fuel demand as the U.S. implemented measures to reduce the spread of the virus. In the second quarter, margins improved as prices of coke and sulfur co-products from our refinery held up relative to the falling prices of crude oil. We also benefited from mark-to-market gains from a hedge on a portion of our crude oil purchases. These improvements were partially offset by a decrease in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark frac spread to an average of $13.27 per barrel. Average crude throughput increased by 11,000 barrels per day to 237,000 barrels per day with the resumption of operations at our fluidized catalytic factory unit during April. We anticipate that reduced demand for gasoline and jet fuel will continue to pressure our Refining margins until demand approaches pre-COVID levels. We are planning to operate the refinery at 85% to 90% of nameplate crude throughput during the third quarter. Please turn to Slide 20 as we review the results of our Technology segment. During the second quarter, Technology segment EBITDA was $112 million, an increase of $56 million compared to the prior quarter. Licensing revenues increased -- catalyst volumes also increased as customers stopped inventories early in the pandemic. Our Technology segment licenses polymer production technologies for new manufacturing plants that enable subsequent catalyst sales to licensing customers over the lifetime of the asset. Individual contract terms and the timing of project milestones results in an uneven pace for licensing revenues. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming milestones, we expect that third quarter licensing profitability will be comparable to the same quarter last year. Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook on Slide 21. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged global positions continued to deliver resilient results during a challenging market environment. We demonstrated commercial agility by pivoting production towards increased demand from packaging and health care markets while aggressively managing inventories for products affected by shutdowns in the automotive and other durable goods manufacturing. Our foundations in leveraging low operating costs and optimal asset utilization serves us well during any point in the cycle. Our capital deployment strategy continues to provide support for our dividend through efficient cash generation and disciplined allocation of capital expenditures for required maintenance and selective profit-generating growth. All capital deployment decisions remain grounded in our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. We believe the pandemic-driven decline in demand bottomed during the second quarter. Demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually rebound as global economies continue to reopen. Markets for discretionary durable goods are improving but will likely take longer to recover from the downturn. We expect that strong consumer-driven demand for our products in packaging and medical applications will continue over the near to medium term. LyondellBasell is addressing these challenges by moving rapidly and decisively to reduce costs, minimize working capital and moderate capital expenditures while prioritizing liquidity and maximizing free cash flow. These actions to bolster cash generation, coupled with recent market improvements, position us well to maintain the continuity of our dividend through this downturn. We continue to look forward and position the company to benefit from opportunities as the global economy rebounds. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne : When we look at your ethylene production capacity, it looks like you're likely a producer of hydrogen, potentially hundreds of thousands of tons a year, and perhaps some of that gets used in the refinery operation, and our assumption is most of it is burned for fuel value. But I was just wondering if you had a view of whether that's the best use for all of that hydrogen potentially to qualify for a color of hydrogen other than gray, and whether you thought about that. Perhaps reducing the carbon footprint from natural gas combustion is the best use of that, but welcome your thoughts on that. Bhavesh Patel : Steve, this is Bob. Indeed, we do produce a lot of hydrogen off of our crackers, especially the ethane crackers. We have some integration with the refinery, as you noted. We also sell some crude hydrogen to the industrial gas companies who then refine the hydrogen.  So there's a mix. Some of it is fuel. Some of it is sold to industrial gas companies, and then -- and the balance goes back to our refinery. And we'll look at that over time as we see industrial gas companies finding new uses for hydrogen to see if we can sell more to them and recover. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : What's the timing of the TBA plant? I think, originally, you were going to spend about $2.4 billion to build it. How much have you spent? How much more is there to go? And I think, originally, you thought that the returns were a little bit over $400 million of EBITDA. Have you changed your view of the returns? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Jeff. So we've essentially delayed the project by 1 year. So originally, our schedule was to complete the project in Q3 of '21 and to commence commissioning. Now we'll complete in Q3 of '22.  We're still updating our capital forecast on that project. So once we have a better number, we'll provide that to the investment community. We're not really prepared to do that today. And then to your question about earnings. So indeed, I mean, we've talked about $400 million to $450 million of EBITDA. And so if you consider 2023 as the first full year of operation, we would expect that kind of that mid-cycle margins for PO and for MTBE, then we should be in that range of $400 million to $450 million of EBITDA contribution. Operator : Our next question comes from Bhavesh Lodaya from BMO Capital Bank. Bhavesh Lodaya : This is Bhavesh for John. So Bob, as we think about your different businesses, it seems like most of them are prime for a nice snapback in terms of earnings from the 2Q levels. So from what you are seeing this month, where do you expect the fastest recovery in terms of the businesses? And what's the magnitude of earnings recovery we should think about as you think about the near term? Bhavesh Patel : Sure. So there's a lot there, and I'll give you kind of the puts and takes. So if you think about our O&P business, that was running well kind of through the lockdown period, especially for end uses like packaging and medical. As we sit here today, we're running in the U.S. basically at full rates. In Europe, we're running between 85% and 90% on our O&P assets. And I would expect that should hold through the quarter. I&D, we're running between 85% and 90%, depending on the region and the product. Remember that in I&D, our PO goes into more durable good-type applications tied to auto as well. And that recovery, while it's occurring, it's happening at a slower pace. Same with fuel demand. It has recovered off the lows, but we're far from where we were at -- in pre-pandemic levels. And then with the refinery, our challenge really is twofold. One is demand recovery for gasoline and for jet fuel, still a long way away from where we were before the pandemic set in. And then the light heavy differential is still very, very narrow, which is hugely leveraging for our refinery. So I think we'll be -- continue to see challenges in the Refining segment for sure. Operator : Next question is from Alex Yefremov from KeyBanc. Aleksey Yefremov : Did you see any feedstock limitations at your Middle Eastern joint ventures? And did you see this issue impact the industry overall? Bhavesh Patel : Alex, not really. We didn't see much impact. If there was, it was marginal for maybe a week or 2, but not sustained. The challenge for our Middle East assets, really in the early part of Q2, was the flatter cost curve and also lower relative prices in China for polyethylene, which both have now moved in the right direction. So we see full availability of feedstock today and much better margins in our Middle East assets. Operator : Next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. P.J. Juvekar: So the question on Slide 12, which is quite helpful when you show the regional production costs, you show that ethane advantage sort of returning back from April to June time period. But on the same slide, the delta between the low cost and the high cost has come down, especially if you compare that back to 2019 levels on that chart. What does that mean to you? I mean does that mean that the profit available for the low-cost player are less than what they were before? Can you just interpret that slide for us in terms of sort of the slope? Bhavesh Patel : Sure. So certainly, the slope is not as great as it was 2 or 3 years ago. But we still think there's enough advantage. And I think today, P.J., margins are really more driven by the dynamics in China. And what we're seeing today is that polyethylene demand is quite strong. In fact, there's very significant year-over-year growth when we look at -- through Q2 for China polyethylene. And prices have responded quite a lot. So I think probably that will be a bigger driver of global polyethylene prices in the near term, is the continued robust demand growth in China. And until oil price moves up further, likely, we have a cost curve that's similar to what it is today. David Kinney : Yes. And P.J., this is Dave. I think what catches your eye on that chart is the MTO coming down sharply with lower methanol prices here in July. And as you know, that's a relatively small portion of global ethylene supply. So not as impactful as it might look on that chart. Operator : Next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Bob, could you give us your view on ethane prices sort of what's happened over the last quarter in terms of the increase and the widening of frac spreads and what you think is going to happen in the back half of the year with ethane exports and maybe propane exports and how the U.S. NGL feedstock price perspective could be in the second half? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Vincent, so on ethane, we had a run-up in price about midway through the quarter. And I think part of that was related to certain producing basins, either shutting in and others restarting, so that it was an effect of the timing of when certain basins were rejecting and certain were in recovery mode. I think as we look at the outlook, it's reasonable to assume that ethane prices will remain kind of in the range where they are today. There's already some talk about some of the drilled but uncompleted wells coming back online in the Permian. And so that could boost supply of ethane. Today, there's still 500,000 barrels a day of rejection of ethane. So we think there's enough ethane available. It's more about local sort of dislocations that have impacted the price. In terms of propane, propane exports have been fairly strong. There's a lot of propane in the world today. So it seems to me that given more modest demand for propane globally, given kind of the economic situation we find ourselves in, I don't think propane can rise a lot relative to ethane. So we think probably kind of where we are today in terms of feedstocks is the right way to think about it going into -- even into Q4. Operator : Next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Bob, as ethylene chain margins have compressed, what impacts do you anticipate on the new supply of ethylene in coming years? Perhaps you could comment on what you see happening with new projects in the U.S., China and elsewhere and also in terms of existing high-cost assets like MTO and some of the higher-cost naphtha-based production in Asia and Europe? Bhavesh Patel : Sure. So coming back to one of the prior questions about the cost curve, I think that if we look at IHS or others who forecast oil price, it seems that the recovery will take some time to get back to the kind of cost curve that we had back in '16 or '17 even. And so likely, with less slope on the cost curve, there will be less investment. We've already seen some delays in the U.S. that have been announced of new projects. I would expect that, that would continue. In China, our working assumption is that largely what's been announced will get built. Now there could be a little bit of delay, but I think it's fair to assume that what's on the books will come online. Elsewhere in the world, though, whether it's the Middle East or it's U.S., I would expect very modest, if any, expansion, given the outlook for especially advantaged feedstocks. And then with MTO, as Dave mentioned earlier, it represents a very small percentage of global capacity, and it always tends to be the swing. When it's in the money, it will run; when it's not, it will shut down. Operator : Next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche. David Begleiter : Bob, some of the recent U.S. polyethylene price strains has been due to strong U.S. exports. But we are going to see about 3 to 4 ethylene crackers, including yours, come on stream in the back half of the year. Do you think that could weaken U.S. exports and then weaken U.S. polyethylene pricing as a result? Bhavesh Patel : Well, David, I think that given that where inventories are in Asia today, they're at -- in China. China port inventory is at 5-year lows, and U.S. exports are at maximum today. Very high level of imports from other parts as well into China. I don't think these couple of 3 crackers will really kind of disturb the environment that we find ourselves in. As I mentioned earlier, growth has resumed in China. We're finding that growth rates are in the 4% to 6% range on polyethylene year-over-year. So -- and still recovery in front of us because even in China, there are hotspots in terms of the virus. So I'm pretty constructive about the outlook through Q3. Operator : Next question is from Hassan Ahmed, Alembic Global Advisors. Hassan Ahmed : Bob, a question around the I&D segment. Obviously, historically, it was one of those segments which quarter after quarter, showed pretty stable margins. And obviously, things have changed over, call it, the last 2 quarters. My question is, as I take a look at the volumes by product within that segment, the styrene side of things, the asset use side of things continues to be stable. But obviously, PO/TBA and the like have seen significant sort of corrections, right? So now the question is that, is this primarily because of the unique nature of this downtake, i.e. it's obviously the auto industry that's gotten hit fairly hard. And as we are seeing signs of recovery in that industry, should we expect a snapback in these products? And should we expect a reversal or -- to those sort of stable margin levels? And how quickly should we expect to see that? Bhavesh Patel : Sure, Hassan. Absolutely. We've always thought of our I&D segment as being one of the more stable segments in the company. And I think it will resume that profile post the virus and after we have vaccines. We've not had a period where both U.S. and European auto manufacturers were completely shut down. So we have no kind of historical reference for that. And now we are seeing demand come back in the auto sector, but it's not back to where it was. And then for the TBA, the fuels demand has been hit very hard because of the lockdowns. Again, something that we don't have any historical context for. So both, I think, will correct post pandemic, if you will. And I do think that I&D will return to its stable profile that we've come to like about that business. Now timing for that, I do think that it's -- of course, it's tied to development of vaccines and therapeutics and, of course, distribution of that. So not just when one is discovered, but when they're actually distributed and given to people. I mean I think the recovery, really, we need to be thinking about second half '21, perhaps even into '22 before we see a full recovery. David Kinney : Hassan, this is Dave. And I'd just add that even though the vehicle miles traveled has returned to what was in January and February before the pandemic, it's nowhere near than the typical summer driving season. And that's what we really need to get those oxyfuels margins back. We're currently in maybe winter-like oxyfuels margins, and it would be nice to be in a typical summer season. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. And lastly, oil prices also help on oxyfuel margins. So higher oil is better for oxyfuel as well. Operator : Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I guess I just wanted to ask about -- get your perspective on polyethylene. I guess maybe -- could you help us understand the market? Maybe the increase in June, what kind of led to success there? And I guess, how are you thinking about July and maybe the persistence and holding on to some of this price that we've gotten recently, do you think that's possible? Or do you think maybe that it was mainly the export market kind of improving that drove the price? And so if there's weakening there, maybe we don't see it, or if there's increased supply, maybe we don't see it. So maybe just get your thoughts on polyethylene. Bhavesh Patel : Sure. So the June increase really was underpinned with lower inventories and the return of exports. So we really, as an industry, ramped up exports in May, June. And I think that continues.  So let me give you some context on inventories. Today, the industry inventories, as reported, are somewhere between 3 and 5 days below previous kind of median values. So very low inventories. I think that the $0.04, of course, is in. $0.05, we think, it looks very firm. Operating rates are very high across the industry. That also helps to support the increase. And then the next $0.05, beyond the $0.04 and the $0.05 that are already kind of implemented, we think given kind of the backdrop and the improvement in demand, and as I mentioned, strong exports, we think that, that $0.05 also has pretty good chance of going through. And by the way, the $0.04 and the $0.05 that have been implemented, most of the realization will be in Q3 for those increases given kind of how the market works. Operator : Next question is from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Congratulations on the Responsible Care Company of the Year. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you. Frank Mitsch : I wanted to follow up on the cash generation. You obviously had a nice quarter in the second quarter, and you've been taking steps to build up a nice cash hoard here. So it kind of begs a question of uses of cash. You had also established a nice track record of raising the dividend. And obviously, Lyondell has been known historically for buying back stock. I was wondering what your latest thoughts on potentially dividend hikes and/or buying back stocks. When might you be in a position given your outlook? And given the success of the $0.05 that you just talked about, might we see some action on that front? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Frank. Thank you. So let me first more broadly answer that question by talking about our capital allocation priorities. So our priorities are very simple. It's investment-grade rating through the cycle and continuity of the dividend through the cycle. So those are the 2 most important things that we're solving for as we kind of run the company through this unusual period. So in terms of dividend, I think, Frank, given the uncertain outlook, too early to really say whether we would do something to increase the dividend or not. Our priority is about continuity of the $4.20 that we paid today. Buybacks. Again, same thing. There's quite a bit of uncertainty until there's a vaccine available and disseminated around the world. So we're going to be somewhat conservative when it comes to increasing dividend or buybacks, just given the uncertain outlook and to make sure that we deliver on the 2 priorities that I mentioned. So that's kind of how I think about uses of cash. Operator : The next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Just a question on the China JV, so as it's ramping up now. First one is just the map the contract you have with your partner, how is that going to get priced? And then as it ramps up, how should we think about that impacting your results? How long will it take for it to start kind of dividend-ing to you guys? And then do you have any offtake that would actually impact your sales number? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So Duffy, on the naphtha pricing itself, you should assume it's plus or minus at market essentially for Northeast Asia. And in terms of earnings impact, really minimal earnings this year because we're going to be in the commissioning stage. And just given our experience with our Hyperzone plant that we've been  ramping up rates on, we shouldn't expect earnings from Bora for the remainder of the year. But the commissioning is underway at that JV. Operator : The next question is from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Similar question. Are you exporting any polyolefins to Bora to help them seed the market in advance of the start-up? And did the improvement in the Technology segment also include Bora? Bhavesh Patel : So Technology segment did not include any benefits from Bora because they've essentially -- they've paid us on our licensing progress payments a while ago. And then in terms of premarketing, as you know, we market polyethylene and polypropylene in Asia today. So we have a decent view of how we can place the additional volume. And so we didn't need to send more volume for seeding the market. We've been exporting to Asia, just a matter of normal course. Operator : Next question is from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : For OP Americas, your EBITDA margin was in the mid-teens. I would imagine it was a lot better in June. Any help in understanding how much better it was? And as you think about you running your plants, I think you said at near 100 -- or nameplate, whatever, in July, how much better should EBITDA margins improve in third quarter versus second quarter? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Mike, I think you can look at IHS-posted price change, if you will, on polyethylene. That will be a guide. Now the $0.04, some of that tends to be realized in July as well. So not all of the $0.04 will be realized in June. And same with the next $0.05 that's being implemented now. It kind of goes across 2 months. Probably the biggest improvement in margin that we're seeing is from the C4 market improving somewhat. It's coming off bottom. It's not great, to be frank, but it's better than what it was back in  March, April. So a combination of stabilizing ethane price, better C4 and higher polyethylene as we realize these increases as kind of the drivers for polyethylene margin. Operator : Next question is from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Just wanted to ask about like after the pandemic is all over. We've seen increased demand from packaging, decreased  trend from industrial so far and decreased recycling. But as we're looking, say, 6 months from now, how do you see this sort of squaring out? Is this packaging demand permanent? Can we actually see a sustained boost? And what about the other pieces? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So Jonas, I think some of the packaging demand will be more permanent. And as you've probably noted, some of the single-use plastic bans have been reversed because of the benefits of -- in terms of hygiene of single-use bags and so on. So I think there will be some lasting benefit, but I wouldn't bank all of it in packaging. There will be some improvement. Then as for the other segments like auto and so on, I mean, we would expect there to be a rapid recovery once a vaccine is developed and we're clearly behind -- the pandemic is behind us. So I think net-net, probably positive for packaging and medical. Operator : The last question in the queue is from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : So your Refining results came in better than our expectations. I was hoping you could quantify the hedge benefit in Q2 and just talk about whether that might reverse in Q3, just given higher crude prices. And then also, could you talk about what's allowing you to run the refinery at levels so much higher than the U.S.? I think in Q2, you were at 88% utilization. U.S. is closer to 72%. So I guess, is that a function of like any Middle Eastern barrels or any sort of wider crude discounts rolling through? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So I'm going to ask Michael to answer the first question on the results. Michael McMurray : Matthew, so it's Michael. Yes, so earlier in the year, we locked in a favorable Maya-Brent differential, hedged out roughly kind of 10% to 15% of our volumes from April through December. At the end of the quarter, had a positive mark of about $3 to $4. That was -- we did not achieve hedge accounting, so that was all in the quarter itself. So that should kind of give you a little bit of color. We would not expect that to kind of recur in the third and fourth quarter, obviously, because we marked it in the second quarter. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. And then in terms of the crude run rates, Matthew, it's more about the configuration of our refinery and the fact that we don't make as much jet or gasoline because we're a heavy crude processing refinery. So for us, it was more about finding incremental barrels to get from 85% to 90% that had positive contribution margin. But I think the heavy processing setup of our refinery probably favored us incrementally. Operator : And that was the final question in the queue. Bhavesh Patel : Okay. Thank you. Well, let me offer a few closing remarks. Our consistent focus on cash generation and disciplined capital allocation will help us steer through any point in the cycle. We're really well equipped for the current challenges. We've leveraged our leading portfolio, our advantaged positions toward our goal of delivering sustainable value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call in October. Thank you. And with that, we're adjourned. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator. Hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's Third Quarter 2020 Teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until November 30 by calling (888) 566-0568 in the United States and 203-369-3064 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 6541.  During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives.  Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. During the third quarter, we recognized pretax LCM benefits totaling $160 million compared to LCM charges of $323 million during the first half of 2020. During the third quarter, we also recognized a noncash impairment of $582 million that reflects our expectation for reduced profitability from our Houston refinery. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments.  With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. We hope that you, your colleagues and your families are all staying healthy and safe during these challenging times. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results.  Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses benefited from improving volumes during the initial months of a recovering global economy. After excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory benefits and an impairment of our refinery, third quarter EBITDA was approximately $900 million, an improvement of more than $200 million relative to the second quarter. We continued to focus on cash generation and retention by efficiently converting more than 90% of our EBITDA into cash from operating activities and by carefully managing our working capital to end the quarter with approximately $5.5 billion of cash and available liquidity.  Our strong balance sheet has served us well by allowing the company to capture opportunity during this downturn through the establishment and start-up of a new integrated polyolefin joint venture in China, followed by the announcement in October of our intent to form another integrated polyethylene joint venture in Louisiana before the end of this year. Both of these joint ventures offer unique opportunities for LyondellBasell to grow one of the core areas of our business by investing in new, already operating, high-quality assets that have significant upside as market conditions continue to improve. These transactions are prime examples of our strategy to identify, develop and capture opportunities through business cycles. Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. Our employees and contractors maintain their focus on performing work safely to eliminate injuries, prevent virus spread and minimize emissions from our assets. During September, we had one recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. Although our goal is always 0 injuries, the September year-to-date recordable injury rate across both our employees and contractors is on track to improve upon the top decile industry performance we achieved in 2019.  Our protocols for workplace sanitization, facial covering, social distancing, health screening and contact tracing have been successful in minimizing the spread of coronavirus across our global facilities. We have no evidence of work-related COVID infections across our global workforce. Our major manufacturing locations operated continuously throughout the pandemic as an essential industry. Our office workers have returned to work in Asia, and we are gradually increasing our office populations across the rest of the world in accordance with local regulations and safety metrics, driven by both employee and community infection rates. We are using a safe and responsible approach to gradually increase the number of personnel at our Houston headquarters during the fourth quarter.  In September, our company released our annual sustainability report, the cover of which is shown on Slide 5. We hope that you will all take some time to review the report. You will note that the cover image of our report does not depict images of solar arrays, wind mills or a pristine beach. Our products make modern life possible and often have a favorable environmental footprint relative to the alternatives. We recognize that plastic waste represents a substantial challenge for society, and our goal is to play a central role in developing pragmatic solutions that balance the needs for environmental, economic and social sustainability.  Our sustainability report describes the actions we will take as a company to help tackle 3 global challenges : eliminating plastic waste, addressing climate change and supporting a thriving society. Over the next decade, we will continue to develop successful waste management projects through the Alliance to End Plastic Waste that will recover and reuse millions of tons of plastic waste. By 2030, we aim to produce 2 million tons of recycled and renewable polymers across our asset base. We are targeting a CO2 intensity that will be 15% lower by 2030 than it was in 2015. And the events of this year have led us to redouble our efforts to ensure a culture of inclusion across our diverse global workforce. We hope you will find that this year's report not only tracks our progress on meaningful metrics for investors, but also describes the increasing scope of our company's ambitions and strategies to support the transition to a low-carbon circular economy and drive solutions for a more sustainable and thriving society. Let's turn to Slide 6 and briefly review how we are advancing on our growth strategy with the Sasol joint venture that we announced on October 2. In summary, LyondellBasell has agreed to purchase a 50% interest in a newly built ethylene cracker, 2 polyethylene units and the associated utilities and infrastructure located in Lake Charles, Louisiana for $2 billion. LyondellBasell will operate the assets and market all of the polyethylene produced by this joint venture. As we discussed a few weeks ago, this transaction will enable both partners to maximize the value of these world-class assets while advancing our respective strategic objectives. While no formal process is set out in the agreements, LyondellBasell will have the potential to acquire the JV assets in full at some point in the future. In addition to the Louisiana joint venture, we also established and started up a joint venture with Bora in China just a few weeks ago. We have been very clear that we have no intention of building a new integrated ethylene cracker on our own for the foreseeable future. But when these 2 JVs in China and Louisiana are taken together, we are essentially acquiring the full capacity and immediate financial benefits of a new and operational world-scale integrated cracker complex with minimal exposure to the risk from project execution, timing uncertainty and opportunity costs that are typically incurred during the multiyear construction of these types of facilities. Plus, we are acquiring this world-scale integrated cracker at a very attractive valuation. With respect to our joint venture with Sasol, both partners are working diligently and making good progress towards obtaining the required approvals that should allow us to close the transaction before the end of this calendar year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial results over the past quarter. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.  Please turn to Slide 7. While the recession and subsequent recovery has presented challenges for our business, we have also found great opportunities in the debt capital markets to reduce our interest costs and extend maturities by refinancing some of our debt as we raise capital to support the formation of the Louisiana joint venture. Immediately after announcing our agreement with Sasol, we renegotiated covenants, extended our revolving credit facility by 1 year and issued $3.9 billion in new bonds. These bonds were very well received by the market with an order book that was more than 5x oversubscribed. We locked in favorable rates with a weighted average coupon of 2.72% across 6 tranches with maturities ranging from 3 to 40 years. The new bonds serve to reduce the weighted average interest rate across our debt portfolio by 34 basis points. After redemptions planned for the coming days, we will have both accessible near-term maturities as well as staggered long-term maturities without any large maturity towers.  With the completion of the Sasol joint venture, we will prioritize deleveraging over share repurchases and work toward improving debt ratios to levels consistent with a stronger investment-grade credit rating. We expect to continue to fund our dividend primarily from operating cash flows. One more modeling item, in the fourth quarter, we'll have a charge of approximately $80 million for loss on extinguishment of debt associated with our refinancing activities.  As Bob mentioned, our cash conversion remained strong in the third quarter. On Slide 8, you can see that over the last 12 months, more than 100% of our EBITDA was converted into nearly $4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our business teams remain highly focused on aggressively managing inventories through these dynamic markets while prioritizing cash generation and liquidity. Now please turn to Slide 9, where we provide further details on cash generation during the third quarter. We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $2.8 billion. Capital expenditures of $425 million declined more than 25% relative to the second quarter, largely due to the reduced pace of construction on our new PO/TBA facility in Houston.  In March, we announced that we were reducing activity on the PO/TBA project to both prevent virus spread at the construction site and conserve capital as we prepared for an uncertain economic environment from the pandemic. We have recently begun to reactivate the project and expect to return to a full pace over the coming weeks. We now expect the project to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately 1 year later than our original schedule. The delayed timing of the start-up should provide benefits from a more fully recovered global economy as well as another year of global demand growth for the products. Higher costs arising from the delayed project execution, more extensive civil construction and unexpected tariffs on materials are expected to add at least 30% to our original cost estimate of $2.4 billion. We plan to provide a more definitive update on the estimated cost after activity is fully restored on the project early next year.  In the third quarter, we also funded the $472 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China and paid $352 million in dividends to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash and available liquidity.  The recognition of the impairment of our refinery during the third quarter has substantially changed the math for computing our 2020 forecasted tax rate. We now believe that our effective tax rate will be significantly lower than our prior guidance of a less than mid-teens percentage rate. Due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of the CARES Act and the timing of certain discrete events, we will not be providing more specific guidance at this time. On the other hand, the refinery impairment has resulted in our cash tax rate being higher than previously communicated. While it's difficult to forecast a specific percentage, we expect that our cash tax payments, net of refunds for 2020, will be approximately $200 million.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review our third quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the noncash LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery. Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continued to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the third quarter was nearly $900 million, more than $200 million higher than the prior quarter. The upward trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter. Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments continue to serve strong consumer demand for products used in packaging and health care markets, while demand increased for intermediates and polymers used in durable goods applications. Volumes rebounded for compounded polymers from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment as automotive manufacturing reopened. Our Refining segment and the Oxyfuels & Related Products business continued to be challenged by decreased mobility that has reduced demand for transportation fuels. We expect that our diverse portfolio of businesses will see further improvement over the coming quarters as global economies continue on the path to recovery.  Let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery is playing out in 2 significant markets for our company : polyethylene and transportation fuels. Let's turn to Slide 11 and review the growth in polyethylene demand during the pandemic. In a typical year, global polyethylene growth rate is approximately 4%. As you can see from the chart, in spite of the pandemic and recession, global polyethylene demand has still grown by 1% over the first 9 months of this year. As expected, Europe has seen a decline, but polyethylene demand in the U.S. and Canada and Northeast Asia regions has grown. Despite capacity additions, China demand will continue to far exceed its domestic production and incentivize North American exports. Low industry operating rates during the second quarter, along with Hurricane Laura in August and strong demand, tightened supply on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which led to polyethylene contract price increases totaling $420 per ton over the months of June through September. The recovery in demand for transportation fuels continues to be stubbornly slow.  On Slide 12, you can see that while U.S. passenger and commercial vehicle travel has returned to within 10% of 2019 levels, U.S. flights and associated jet fuel consumption is still down by 40%. In March and April, refiners reduced operating rates in response to low demand and shifted distillate production from jet fuel to diesel. While gasoline and jet fuel inventories are currently at manageable levels, the excess distillate capacity has driven diesel inventories to levels 30% above the same period last year. Industry consultants believe that up to 3 million barrels of global refining capacity will need to be rationalized over the coming years to support more normalized margins since it is unlikely for airline travel to rebound to full utilization of the available refining capacity. As a result of an extended challenging outlook for refined product demand and margins, we recognized an impairment of the value of our refinery during the third quarter.  Now let me summarize how these trends have come together for our company on Slide 13. In these initial months of economic recovery following the pandemic lockdowns, demand for our products has proven to be resilient. As you can see in the comparison to the third quarter of last year in the top chart, our sales volumes are largely intact. Further progress is needed to drive margin recovery.  Comparing our performance relative to the second quarter in the bottom chart, you see the stepwise improvement. Volumes are up and margins have improved in all of our businesses, except for those serving transportation fuels markets. With continuing recovery in gasoline demand from passenger cars, we expect that our Oxyfuels business should recover more quickly than the broader refining market.  Let's review the third quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery. I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment on Slide 14.  Third quarter EBITDA was $404 million, $194 million higher than the second quarter. Improved demand for polyethylene and higher ethylene prices resulted in higher margins and volumes. Olefins results increased approximately $220 million compared to the second quarter. Industry ethylene supply tightened, which led to price increase that improved olefins margins. Volume increased due to higher demand and the completion of planned maintenance at our Channelview cracker in the second quarter. Polyolefin results increased by about $25 million during the third quarter. Increased polyethylene demand drove higher margin and volume, partially offset by a decrease in polypropylene margin. We anticipate both volume and margin improvement for our O&P-Americas segment during the fourth quarter. Recent polyolefins price increases are expected to find support from industry supply constraints and robust demand. If global economies continue to improve, this momentum could persist for the remainder of the year.  Now please turn to Slide 15 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $131 million, $88 million lower than the second quarter. Integrated profit margins were impacted by rising feedstock costs. Olefins results decreased approximately $30 million, driven by a decrease in margin. Ethylene margin decreased as higher feedstock costs outpaced an increase in ethylene prices. Combined polyolefins results decreased $20 million compared to the prior quarter. Polyethylene volume decreased due to summer demand and polypropylene margin declined on lower spreads. Although equity income decreased by approximately $10 million during the quarter, we were pleased to record a positive contribution for our Bora joint venture in September, the very first month of its operations. In October, we've seen a slight decline in integrated polyethylene margin. Over the fourth quarter, we expect a typical seasonal decline in demand as we approach the year-end holiday season.  Please turn to Slide 16. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $245 million, $124 million higher than the prior quarter. Volumes rebounded with increased demand from durable goods markets in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business and the completion of planned maintenance in the Intermediate Chemicals business. Third quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results increased by approximately $45 million, driven by higher volumes from increased demand for polyurethanes in automotive, construction and furniture markets. Intermediate Chemicals results increased about $40 million, mostly driven by higher volumes after the completion of our planned maintenance. Oxyfuels & Related Products results increased approximately $10 million as a result of slightly higher margins due to higher product prices. In the coming quarter, stable demand for durable goods should continue to support profitability across most of the businesses in this segment. In October, oxyfuels prices and margins have come under additional pressure with lower seasonal driving demand.  Now let's move on and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 17. Third quarter EBITDA was $117 million, $94 million higher than the second quarter. Volumes rebounded significantly, driven by higher demand for our products. Third quarter integration costs were $7 million. Compounding & Solutions results increased approximately $90 million due to higher volumes driven by increased demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end markets. Advanced Polymer's results were relatively unchanged. Although the demand for our products is improving, we expect typical seasonality to affect fourth quarter profitability for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment as activities in the automotive and construction market slowdown at the end of each calendar year. At our Investor Day last September, we updated our targets for synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition to $200 million. I'm happy to say that we have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we believe that the annual run rate of more than $200 million will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in this segment.  Now let's turn to Slide 18 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was negative $121 million, a $107 million decrease versus the second quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and the onetime impairment of the Houston refinery. Results for the quarter were pressured by excess industry capacity and reduced demand for transportation fuels.  In the third quarter, lower demand for gasoline and jet fuel negatively impacted both margins and volumes. Margins declined in the third quarter due to the absence of a hedging gain recorded in the second quarter, unfavorable byproduct spreads and a decrease in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark crack spread. During the quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread decreased to as low as $7.75 per barrel and ended at a historically low quarterly average of $9.89 per barrel. In response to sluggish demand, we reduced the utilization rate at the refinery to 81%, with an average crude throughput of 216,000 barrels per day. Refining margins are expected to remain compressed until demand for gasoline and jet fuel returns closer to pre-COVID levels. We plan to operate the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the fourth quarter.  Let me be clear that we are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at the refinery. We are deferring nonsafety-related discretionary activities and reducing the salaried workforce by approximately 10% at our refinery through early retirements and potential worker redeployments to our other facilities in the Houston area. We are evaluating every possible option with regard to procuring crude oil and optimizing production from this asset.  Please turn to Slide 19 as we review the results of our Technology segment. Third quarter Technology segment EBITDA was comparable to the prior quarter at $111 million. Licensing revenues increased, while catalyst margin and volume decreased. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming licensing milestones and catalyst demand, we expect that the fourth quarter Technology business profitability will be similar to the first quarter of this year. Please turn to Slide 20 and allow me to review the progress of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a very clear and simple strategy : to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation while moderating our capital expenditures. Earlier this year, we accelerated our plans to reduce capital expenditures to $2 billion or less. We intend to maintain our capital budget at these levels for the next 3 years.  In the second quarter, we started a 500,000-ton per year polyethylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation Hyperzone HDPE technology. At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this asset is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA.  On September 1, we established a new joint venture in Northeastern China with Bora. This investment has already contributed earnings in September, and recent margins indicate the joint venture is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our company.  In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and we formed the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. With integration completed, we are on track to capture $200 million in estimated synergies that should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the markets served by this segment.  We expect to close the transaction for the Louisiana joint venture with Sasol before the end of this year. At full capacity and historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA to our company.  In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, the combination of 2 new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023 could together add almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. The formula is very simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should result in higher free cash flow at any point in the business cycle.  Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook with Slide 21. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged global positions enabled us to capture value and deliver resilient results. We demonstrated commercial agility by matching production with continued demand from packaging and health care markets and increasing volumes from automotive and other durable goods markets. We are seeing higher demand for our products from recovering global economies. Our North America polyethylene exports are increasing to support growing demand in Asia. Markets for discretionary durable goods are improving.  As global mobility increases, the demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually show improvement. Our financial strategy continues to support our commitment to an investment-grade rating. With sound cash generation and disciplined capital deployment decisions, we are focused on maintaining the continuity of our dividend and prioritizing deleveraging upon completion of the Sasol transaction. Our goal at LyondellBasell is to capture opportunities throughout all points of business cycles. Over the past several years, we have carefully planted the seeds for profit-generating growth by building, acquiring and partnering on assets that expand our reach with new capabilities to sustainably harvest profitability from advantaged feedstocks, expanded product ranges and an increased footprint in the world's fastest-growing markets. We look forward to discussing our progress on maximizing cash flow from these investments over the coming quarters.  We are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question in the queue is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : So it looks like there's -- normally, you have a seasonal dip as you go from kind of 3Q levels to 4Q for a whole host of reasons. But it seems like given this year is a little bit of an atypical year, we'll call it, where you've got polyethylene prices surging throughout the third quarter and into the fourth and you've got maybe not quite as big of a delta around transportation fuels and that type of thing, I guess, how should we be thinking about your ability to maybe buck the trend of the normal seasonal dip going into 4Q? Is that something that's possible as the economies are recovering or is that maybe too much of a stretch? Bhavesh Patel : John, indeed, especially in polyethylene, as you noted, this year -- and polypropylene, to an extent, this year, because of the hurricanes, and prior to that, the inventory reduction that we undertook as a company and generally as an industry, likely if there's some slowdown in demand, certainly, we, as a company, will take the opportunity to rebuild some inventory. We're at very, very low levels today and really kind of hand to mouth on many products. And I suspect that, that will get us through the seasonally soft period and get into next year. So I suspect that will be the case in polyolefins for the most part. Operator : Next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Just curious about this Bora JV. Is the $150 million EBITDA projection, is that effectively a net income number, kind of how would you compare that to your other assets in terms of the margin? And the reason I ask is, naphtha pricing has been pretty volatile over there, and I don't know whether that's fair to be looking at for that joint venture. Is it more likely that you're really getting the naphtha linked to oil prices from your refinery JV partner? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So Steve, the $150 million will be at the EBITDA level. So it's like equity earnings. Think of it that way. We do not expect dividends from Bora for a couple of years because the priority will be to delever. You will recall that the financing was roughly 1/3 equity, 2/3 debt for Bora. So the way we've outlined the joint venture and how the bank covenants work, we need to prioritize delevering first. We'll get some incremental commission income from the sales of polyolefins. The likely dividend income will come in year 3, 4 and onwards. Operator : Next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Brent prices have moved down from about, I don't know, $44 a barrel to $37 over the past month. Do you think that will make a difference to global petrochemical prices? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Jeff. So it may, but I think right now what's driving global petrochemical prices and especially polyolefin prices, it's more about the heightened level of demand that we've seen, very low levels of inventory. And I think that's really what's going to drive near-term pricing and provide support potentially for the final increase that's been announced here in the U.S.  The other thing to note about a falling oil price is that it should benefit our European business. Because typically when oil price declines, we see margins open up in Europe. We saw the opposite of that in Q3 as oil prices actually increased, and we saw a bit of margin squeeze as we couldn't pass all of that through to the end users. So I think net, probably a benefit for Europe and near-term supply/demand likely drives pricing more so than Brent price. Operator : Next question is from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Aleksey Yefremov : Your O&P-Europe EBITDA has been sort of all over the place over the last 4 quarters with crude oil moving around, just like you just said, Bob. What's a good normalized number for the current environment for this segment? Is this closer to $130 million, $140 million that you just printed in the third quarter or maybe around $220 million EBITDA that you had in the first half of this year? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Aleksey, right now because there's so many moving parts, I hesitate to give you a normalized number. I think you've put your finger on a few of the drivers, which is the direction of oil price. Also, Europe has been one of the softer regions in the world. We've seen improvement in Europe from Q2 to Q3, but it has not been to the degree that we've seen in China and the U.S. So I would say more of a mixed market in Europe and more clear strength in the U.S. and in China. Well, let's wait until next quarter and we'll try to help you with that normalized number, but today I hesitate just given all the moving parts. Operator : Next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Question about 2 of your assets. So first one is just the refinery. With the write-down, what is the current book value of that asset? And are we in the ZIP code where we're actually thinking about maybe shuttering the asset? And then the second one is just PO/TBA, the increase in costs there and the delay. What's that going to do to the return on that project? Bhavesh Patel : Duffy, on the refinery, book value will be a little over $500 million, and we'll post that in our Q later today or Monday. So that's after the write-down. On the PO/TBA project, certainly, returns will be lower, we think, probably in the 10% range on returns for PO/TBA. I think in the end, we're going to net out kind of the delay of the project in this way. I think, first of all, it gave us some cushion on cash flow this year that given the uncertainty at the time we made the decision back in Q2, I still continue to believe it was the right thing to do. Secondly, when we do start up, it will be timed better when markets are recovering or fully recovered, hopefully by then. And we'll be bringing new capacity online at a time where it's more likely to be needed. So in the end, I think balancing near-term needs with long-term market demand, I think this was the right call to make, and we continue to believe it was the right call. Operator : Next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. P.J. Juvekar: Polyethylene goes in disposables like plastic bags and packaging. So the European PE demand, down 3% versus North America up 4%, that was quite a stark difference between the 2. And I thought Europeans stuck at home would be doing the similar things like ordering from home and packaging demand goes up with that. Is there something underlying in Europe that's going on besides just the weak economy? Bhavesh Patel : So from our perspective, we really saw the industrial part of the demand be very weak. And you will recall that the automotive sector was essentially shut down. For example, we produce polyethylene that goes into fuel tanks. And so that's continued to be weak. The automotive sector has not come back in Europe as strongly as it has in the U.S., industrial bulk containers, things like that. So the industrial part of demand was softer in Europe. I think on the packaging side, we saw similar strength of what we've seen in the U.S. So it's more about the level of activity. It didn't resume to the rate that we had expected. And lastly, in Q3, we still saw some seasonal slowdown from a typical European holiday season. There's the European kind of vacation season where some of the factories shut down. There was still some of that and enough that it caused some seasonality in Q3. Operator : Next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort : Bob, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on ethane. I was looking at the nat gas markets are up 80% or 90% from the summer and the ethane markets look like they're only up about $0.10. The strip on ethane looks fairly subdued. But I guess if the oil markets are terrible, maybe there's less drilling and there's some more -- the downtime curtailments start to dissipate. Do you see a potential run on ethane in the first quarter? And is there something you guys can do proactively to insulate yourself if that were to happen? Bhavesh Patel : Bob, so first of all, we estimate that ethane rejection rates are still pretty high, probably north of 500,000 barrels per day. I've heard numbers much higher, almost double that. But likely, the rejection is probably happening in regions that are further away from the Gulf Coast. So there's probably some in the Permian, but probably more as you get out towards the Rockies and certainly in the Marcellus. So today, you see ethane in the low 20s. I wouldn't be surprised to see ethane move to the mid-20s, especially here in the winter as natural gas prices rise a little bit more. I don't think we'll see a spike only because higher prices will likely incent more supply to come online. And maybe, as you say, with more crackers starting up, we may, on the margin, need more supply from further away regions. And if that were to happen, then maybe ethane does move to the mid-20s. But I still think there's so much rejection out there that a little bit of price will incent more supply. Operator : Next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Bob, just on polyethylene for the October increase. One of the leading consultancies have declared that increase not successful. Do you agree with that assessment? Bhavesh Patel : Well, so David, first of all, there are kind of timing effects on when these price increases get implemented, and it's phased over a 2-month period depending on contracts and size of buyer and that sort of thing. But if you kind of step back and look at the market environment today, as I mentioned earlier, inventories are still really low. And in fact, this morning, I was just looking at ACC data and days on hand is like 10% lower than where it was last year. And that's days on hand, so including a lower sales rate, the absolute inventory levels are incredibly low today. So I think that points to a tighter market.  Secondly, we don't see demand really letting up yet. Our order books are filling up quickly for November. And as I said earlier, likely if there's some softness, certainly, our approach is going to be, we're going to have to build back a bit of inventory because of the impacts of weather and also just stronger demand. So let's see how it plays out, but it seems to me that, from our perspective, the increase is still on the table. Operator : Next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Just getting back to the polyethylene demand dynamics. If this year, let's just say, it finishes the year plus 1%, it's supposed to grow 4%. How do you think about next year? Do we have an above 4% year next year because some of the rebound maybe in the auto and industrial part as you suggested or do we just have had this air pocket this year and we don't make any of it up? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So Vincent, so U.S. PE demand so far year-to-date has grown about 1.7%. And if you look at Q3, the year-over-year is like 2.5%. So you can really see the higher level of demand growth post the low Q2. So I think Q2 was kind of a lost quarter.  Just to kind of round out the regional look. In Europe, demand is up 2.5% year-to-date. And in China, it's up almost 5% year-to-date. And in China, imports are up about 5% year-to-date as well. So a really good growth rate globally in polyethylene. And to your point about, is there some catch-up growth next year, I do think in the industrial and auto areas. Now auto impacts polypropylene more than it does polyethylene. But I think when the recovery really takes hold, we should see above trend line growth for a year to 18 months. And I still expect that to be the case. We'll probably see that more dramatic in polypropylene just given that there's more durable good end-use in polypropylene. Operator : Next question is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Bob, wanted to sort of continue with some of your thoughts around polyethylene. I was taking a quick look at Chinese polyethylene import data that just came out for September. Imports were up 36% year-on-year. Month-on-month, they were up 17%. And obviously, that's with the backdrop of continued sort of supply additions out there. So as you look at the near term, call it, 2021 and things start sort of normalizing, but obviously, more capacity keeps coming online, how should we be thinking about the pace of Chinese polyethylene imports? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So if you look over the next 2 to 3 years, it seems that if you use historical demand growth, the new capacity likely won't be enough to meet demand growth. And so they're going to need to incrementally import more polyethylene. And we don't think imports have leveled out yet in China. And we think that will be the case. I don't know about next year because of timing of projects, whether they're delayed or not. But if I look over the next 2-, 3-year horizon, likely their import needs grow. Another thing to think about, Hassan, is that if you look at Q2 to Q3, as U.S. demand came back in polyethylene, exports actually declined significantly from Q2 to Q3 out of the U.S. And if you look at U.S. next year, there's very little new capacity in polyethylene coming online. So speaking to the prior question about, will we see higher demand growth in the U.S. if there's catch up demand, I think if that's the case, there will be less being exported out of the U.S. and likely that will create a tighter global market.  And lastly, if you look out further on polyethylene supply/demand, you're already seeing many projects that are being canceled or delayed. So it seems to me that we're seeing kind of a classic setup of a cycle here as we sit in the trough. You're starting to see delays, starting see cancellations. And let's assume China brings on all of the capacity that's announced, they still need to import more. Operator : Next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I guess, I just wanted to go back to polypropylene. Could you just remind us how much of your portfolio is levered there across O&P-Americas, Europe and APS? And what is your outlook there? I guess you mentioned a lot of durables exposure, obviously, could remain quite depressed, especially if we go into another round of lockdowns. But maybe you can just offer your thoughts on the polypropylene market and the impact on LyondellBasell. Bhavesh Patel : Certainly. So Arun, at a high level, polyethylene certainly is a bigger driver than polypropylene if I look globally. In the U.S., polyethylene is a bigger business for us than polypropylene. In Europe, polypropylene is a bit bigger than polyethylene, not by a lot. And in APS, post the acquisition of A. Schulman, we're much more diversified. Prior to the acquisition of A. Schulman, right, 100% of our compounding was essentially polypropylene and about 90% was automotive. And you will recall back when we announced that transaction, that was part of the rationale was to have more diversity and participation in the end use segments, in packaging, in medical and have more polyethylene content. So I'd say on APS, we're probably still 60% polypropylene, 40% other, just as kind of a rough breakdown. On the polypropylene outlook, certainly, polypropylene has struggled this year, especially in Q2 because of the higher durable good and auto content. Polypropylene demand is down year-to-date by 1% to 2% in Europe and U.S., up significantly, though, in China. So China polypropylene demand is up some 15%. It's a very, very large increase. So our view is that polypropylene will be very constructive. We don't see kind of a wall of supply. And actually, I think that as the economies recover around the world, durable goods will likely grow faster into a growing economy and a recovering economy, which probably favors polypropylene even more than polyethylene. Operator : Next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : A financial question for you. It looks like your net debt balance increased about $425 million on a sequential basis. I heard you call out the payments to Bora. So if I adjust for that, the net debt would have trended flat to down, let's say. My question is, are there other issues, I don't know, working capital, timing issues, other onetime events that would have prevented you from deleveraging more in the third quarter? Michael McMurray : Yes, it's Michael. Yes, really Bora is the big one to call out. There's really nothing else of any significance to call out. Bhavesh Patel : Kevin, if you look at this year, our operating cash flow will more than cover dividend and all the ongoing expenses. So we should have a surplus pre the Bora equity infusion. Michael McMurray : Yes. Operator : Next question is from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : If I could just follow-up on that. Bob, you mentioned when you were talking about the Sasol JV that perhaps in the future you might acquire all of those assets. And obviously, you also discussed that the priority right now is to delever. How should we think about the potential timing of doing something with Sasol in the future? And then I guess, just kind of an overarching theme, should we think that Lyondell might do some more M&A in terms of making acquisitions in '21 or really will the delevering be front and center? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Frank, so first of all, I just want to be real clear on our capital allocation priorities. Maximize cash flow, continuity of the dividend and solid investment-grade rating through the cycle, we're committed. Whatever we decide to do, we're committed to the dividend and the investment-grade rating. Having said all that, timing of a Step 2, probably 3 to 5 years out. So I think we have a window to delever before that decision is upon us.  Now of course, a lot of that depends on the pace of the recovery, how much excess free cash flow we generate in '21, '22 and '23. But remember that Sasol, the first half of the JV will be contributing excess cash flow beyond the additional interest expense that we'll take on. So we think that will be accretive or additive to cash flow for next year. Based on our current outlook, we think next year we can cover the dividend from operating cash flow. So I think our priorities are going to be to delever, first and foremost. And I think there's enough time before the Step 2 will be upon us. We'll be able to delever meaningfully. Operator : Next question is from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : I apologize if I misheard this, but I thought you mentioned that OP Americas would improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Hopefully, The Browns continue that rout as well. But when you think about that margin green in Slide 14, was the bulk of that achieved in September? And is that sort of the run rate as we head into the fourth quarter? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Mike. So the -- indeed, the timing of price increases, except for that last 5, most of it was implemented kind of later in the quarter as the way it all lays out. So I think that's probably a reasonable way to look at it is the September would be the run rate going into Q4. I think the thing we'll have to watch for is the seasonality. As I mentioned earlier in response to some of the other questions, my sense is that the market is so tight and the inventories are so low that I don't think we'll see the degree of seasonal softness that we've seen in past years this year, but let's see.  And to your comment about The Browns, let's hope they continue to strengthen as we go into Q4. Operator : Next question is from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Looking at the compounding business. So it sounds like your synergies are captured and automotive is coming back. Polymer prices are, for lack of a better word, normalizing. So can you give us a sense for how do you think about sustained or sustainable earnings in that business? And how are you thinking about a strategic outlook for it? Is this something you're looking at adding to? Bhavesh Patel : Jonas, so first of all, on APS, I think you're really in Q3 starting to see what a fully synergized APS represents and the earnings power. As volume grows, more of those dollars will flow straight to the bottom line in a much more efficient platform post our synergies. If you go back to pre-COVID and around the time of the acquisition, the LyondellBasell business that was in APS, that is in APS today was earning at that time about $375 million of EBITDA. We acquired $200 million from A. Schulman, and we achieved $200 million of synergies. So nearly $800 million of EBITDA, that was kind of the run rate back in '18.  So the question now is, what's the trajectory to get back to that kind of earnings rate? And I think, as you mentioned earlier, a lot of that will be tied to the recovery in automotive, looks very good in U.S. and in China. Europe needs to improve meaningfully for us to firmly be on the path to get to those kind of numbers that we had back in '18. But again, I think as volume increases, we should see a large part of that revenue fall to the bottom line on the margin because the fixed costs are now all covered and we have a synergized platform. So normalized earnings, if you go back to '18 conditions, should be closer to $800 million. Operator : Next question is from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Do you need to write down the TBA assets as well like you wrote down the refinery? Or because it's integrated into the PO operations, the value doesn't need impairment? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So exactly, as you said, first of all, it's a co-product in our I&D business. But more importantly, John, the market characteristics for TBA are a bit different than what we see for our refinery because the margin in TBA is based on upgrading butane to MTBE. So whereas in the refinery, part of our margin is the light-heavy differential. And there, we think there's a longer road to recovery to get more sour crude back on the market. I would characterize the TBA downturn as cyclical and perhaps part of the refining downturn as being a little bit more lasting because of this lack of supply of sour crude. So we will not be writing down our PO/TBA or our TBA assets. Think of that as being more cyclical. Operator : The last question in the queue is from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : Are you still planning a refinery turnaround in 2021? And if so, can you share any details on the cost and the scope? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So Matthew, you've got us in the middle of thinking through that. So I'll be able to give you a definitive answer at the next earnings call. We're thinking through our cash needs for the company, how the markets will develop. We want to make a really thoughtful decision because we still think that our refinery is an asset that makes it through this downturn. So partly what I'm trying to balance here is near term versus long term and how do we position the refinery best for when markets do return. So we're going through all that math now. And certainly, we're going to do whatever we need to do to manage the regulatory requirements and all of the safety-related projects that we need to do. And those are a primary focus for us. And then beyond that, the turnaround timing is part of a broader set of decisions that we're trying to make next year for the refinery. So stay tuned. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. Bhavesh Patel : All right. Well, thank you. Well, let me offer a few closing remarks.  Our team at LyondellBasell, we're continuing to focus on near term maximizing free cash flow, continue the dividend and maintaining a solid investment-grade rating through the cycle, as I've consistently mentioned over the past few calls. At the same time, I think we're really well positioned to emerge stronger from the pandemic because we'll have a lot more assets, a synergized APS platform, we'll have lower CapEx as we come out of the pandemic as well. And I think all that sets us up to really accelerate on free cash flow generation with our initial focus being on delevering. But I think our company is really setting up for coming out of this downturn in a very good way, much stronger than when we entered.  So thank you for your interest in our company, and we'll look forward to updating you at the end of January, have a great weekend and be safe. Operator : This concludes today's call.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 PM Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling 800-846-0305 in the United States and 402-998-0543 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 6541. During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last-in first-out LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. During the fourth quarter, we recognized pre-tax LCM benefits totaling $147 million compared to LCM charges of $163 million during the first nine months of 2020. During the third quarter, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $582 million related to our Houston Refinery. Comments made on the call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. Let's turn to Slide 3. 2020 was unlike anything we have ever seen or experienced, oil price volatility, a global pandemic and an associated recession. To call this year unprecedented would be an understatement. So before we get into the results today, I want to take a few minutes to provide some context around our approach to navigating the past year, because I think it speaks well to who we are as a company and the character and talent of our team. Early in the year, as it became clear that the virus is becoming more widespread, our leadership team established three guiding principles for the short term; number one, protect our employees and communities; two, keep our commitments to our investors; and three, take actions to strengthen the company for the future. In past earnings calls, I've talked about some attributes of our culture; operational and commercial excellence, cost management and capital discipline. These qualities served us particularly well during 2020 as we bolstered liquidity by rapidly accessing capital markets, minimizing working capital and efficiently generating cash. Importantly, we honored our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating and continue to fund dividends and capital investments with cash from operations. As we review our results today, I hope the outcome of these priorities and the benefits of this culture will be clear. Beyond the strategy itself, I also want to take a moment to acknowledge our global team that delivered our results. These individuals, both those who were able to work remotely and those who continue to work on the front lines at our manufacturing sites form a strong and nimble team. They have my sincere and deepest gratitude. If the pandemic reinforced anything, it is the value of our products and industry in serving modern society's needs. Knowing that the materials produced by our plants go into end products like face masks, medical gowns and COVID-19 test kits, our team took immediate action to ensure our manufacturing sites would continue to supply our customers, while prioritizing the safety of our workforce. I'm very proud to say that not only did we continue to operate reliably, but to date there have been no cases of workplace virus transmission among our employees. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of improving cash conversion. The benefit of efficient cash conversion becomes more apparent during periods of economic downturns when liquidity provides defense against risk from volatility and uncertainty. Over the past year LyondellBasell converted 88% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. As a result of the challenging market dynamics in 2020, our business teams took aggressive actions in managing inventories to drive free cash flow and maximize liquidity to release more than $300 million of cash from working capital. We are pleased to report that despite the downturn, we've fully funded $1.4 billion in dividends and our $1.9 billion capital investment program through cash generated from operating activities in 2020. The $4.20 per share of dividends paid by our company during the year extends LyondellBasell's track record of consistently paying and increasing our base dividend over the past 10 years. Let's continue to Slide 8 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment throughout the year. As you can see, we increased the amount of cash in our balance sheet by approximately $1.4 billion during 2020, to end the year with $2.5 billion in cash and liquid investments. Cash from operations fully funded a small amount of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 as well as the full year's dividends and capital expenditures. In 2020, we accessed very attractive debt capital markets to extend maturities of existing debt, fund acquisitions and bolster liquidity. These borrowings increased gross debt by $3.9 billion relative to the prior year. A portion of the new bonds funded the $470 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China, and the $2 billion acquisition of our 50% share of the Louisiana integrated polyethylene joint venture with Sasol. We incurred about $70 million in pre-tax cost due to our fourth quarter refinancing activities. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and available liquidity that enabled us to reduce the balance of our term loan by $500 million in January of 2021. We will continue to prioritize deleveraging over the course of this year, which should allow us to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10, which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the past five quarters. Unlike a typical year where LyondellBasell's business portfolio would follow a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring midyear, the pattern seen in 2020 are reversed with higher profitability in the first and fourth quarters. The rebound in profitability since the second quarter has been remarkable as the global economy proceeds on a path to recovery. EBITDA in the final quarter of 2020 was $1.3 billion, the highest for any fourth quarter since 2017, and more than $375 million higher than the prior quarter. The trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter. Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments served strong consumer-driven demand for packaging and non-durable products throughout the year, while our Intermediates and Derivatives and Advanced Polymer Solutions segments benefited from improving industrial sector demand for durable goods during the second half of the year. We have only seen modest recovery in the demand for transportation fuels. Our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses continued to experience headwinds from excess capacity and slack demand due to persistently low global mobility. While we would naturally prefer to see strength in all of the markets we serve, the geographic and end-market diversity of our product portfolio continues to provide offsets that help to dampen business cycles. Let's turn to Slide 11, and look at the latest thoughts from consultants on the global polyethylene business cycle. Industry consultants have forecasted that capacity additions, especially in China, could outpace global demand over the next four years. These predictions seem reminisce in the forecast from consulting reports published in 2016 depicted by the dotted blue line, which predicted global operating rates would get due to the capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast from 2017 through 2018. The actual operating rate depicted by the solid line demonstrates that press releases announcing capacity additions often have ambitious timelines and typical delays in construction and commissioning can allow consistent demand growth to absorb capacity additions with less impact on operating rates and margins than predicted. In addition to delays in capacity additions, we believe recent forecast underestimate growth in demand. Early in the pandemic many predicted declines in PV demand for 2020. By the middle of the year, forecast improved to flat demand, most consultants now believe that global PV demand grew by approximately 4% in 2020, similar to growth rate seen consistently over the past 30 years. Adjusting these forecast to 4% demand growth for both 2020 and 2021 results in a predicted operating rate depicted in the dotted gray line. If 2021 follows pattern seen after prior recessions and demand growth rebounds to levels higher than 4%, then operating rates would accordingly move upward. Our rebounding economy that increases 2021 global polyethylene demand by 7% followed by a reversion to consultant forecast of 4% growth thereafter would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line. In summary, we believe the next wave of capacity additions will result in operating rates within the boundaries of a balanced market. The next wave of capacity additions will undoubtedly occur, but we believe that typical project delays, a few project cancellations and perhaps increased demand from a recovering economy could contribute to a more orderly absorption of the new capacity by the global markets. Let's review the fourth quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston Refinery. I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 12. Fourth quarter 2020 EBITDA was $722 million, $318 million higher than the third quarter. Margins improved on higher pricing driven by higher demand for both Olefins and Polyolefins. Olefins results increased $185 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Margin improved on higher ethylene and propylene pricing. Volume increased with improved demand. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $65 million higher than the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. For the full year, results decreased by $514 million, margins declined for both Olefins and Polyolefins, driven by lower prices for Olefins co-products and polyethylene, despite lower feedstock costs. Lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic drove increases in demand for non-durable packaging and consumer goods providing strength in the polyethylene market and increased volumes for ethylene and polyethylene. Based on strong February orders, increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $120 million compared to the third quarter. Improving demand for polyolefin and a full quarter of contribution from our Bora joint venture increased both polyolefin volumes and equity income. Olefins results were relatively unchanged with lower margins due to increased maintenance expense, partially offset by increased volume. Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million, driven by higher demand and volumes from our Bora joint venture. Equity income increased about $60 million with more than half of that improvement arising from Bora. Full year EBITDA was $236 million lower than 2019. Margins declined in both Olefins and Polyolefins due to lower polyolefin and ethylene prices outpacing lower feedstock costs. Polyolefin demand remained relatively stable with increased sales from the start-up of our Bora joint venture during the fourth quarter. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year. Please turn to Slide 14. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $196 million, a decline of $49 million from the third quarter 2020. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products, driven by weaker gasoline demand and prices muted the margin improvement in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business. Fourth quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to significantly higher Asia propylene oxide pricing, driven by strong demand and tight markets supplies. Intermediate Chemicals results were relatively unchanged. Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased by approximately $10 million, a small volume improvements or more than offset by margin declines due to continued lower gasoline prices and higher butane feedstock costs. During 2020 EBITDA declined $714 million compared to 2019. Margin declined in most businesses, primarily in the Oxyfuels & Related Products and Intermediate Chemicals businesses. Volumes for most businesses also declined due to lower demand, partially offset by increased Asia demand for our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives products. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect margins to be relatively flat as market tightness in Asia is alleviated by higher industry supply. Our volumes will be impacted during the first quarter due to planned maintenance at our Channelview propylene oxide and styrene monomer unit. Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $126 million, a $9 million increase over the third quarter 2020. Volumes increased with improved demand in the automotive sector partially offset by lower margins. Results for both Compounding & Solutions and Advanced Polymer businesses were relatively unchanged. Within our Compounding & Solutions business volumes increased as automotive manufacturers ramped up production. Margins declined as a result of product prices lagging price increases for propylene feedstocks. Full year EBITDA for the segment was $381 million, a $51 million decline over 2019. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from an $80 million reduction in integration costs. Volumes decline would significantly lower automotive, appliance and construction demand, partially offset by higher margins as a result of product mix. We expect continued recovery in industrial durable goods demand, particularly for products from our Advanced Polymers business during the spring. At our Investor Day in 2019, we announced an increased target of $200 million of synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition. We have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we are beginning to capture an annual run rate of more than $200 million, which will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Now let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery in durable goods demand is playing out in the polypropylene and compounds markets for our company on Slide 16. China's rapid response to control COVID transmission and stimulate industrial production resulted in strong demand growth despite the pandemic. Automotive production in China was up 6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, and China polypropylene demand for the full year 2020 increased by 10% over 2019. The strength in durable goods markets is also evident in LyondellBasell's metrics. Our polypropylene inventory levels hit all time lows in both North America and Europe on strong market demand. In North America, construction activities increased in the fourth quarter with a 5% year-over-year increase in demand for single-ply thermoplastic roofing materials that utilize our Catalloy advanced polymers. Looking at our own order books for polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy within the EPS segment a nice V-shaped recovery is shown in the chart where the forecast for January suggests the first quarter that is nearly the same level seen in the first quarter of 2019. Tight markets, low inventory and strong orders indicate that markets for polypropylene-based durable goods are showing strength going into the first quarter 2021. The increased demand for our polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy products should benefit the EPS segment in 2021. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was negative $74 million, a $47 million improvement versus the third quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and impairment of the Houston Refinery in the third quarter. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to lower fixed costs and improved margin capture Improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread were more than offset by increased costs for Renewable, Identification, Number of credits, or RINs. Similar to the prior period, we operate the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity to match with its demand with an average crude throughput of 214,000 barrels per day. Full-year EBITDA was negative $289 million, $224 million lower than 2019. Refining margins were compressed due to pandemic driven reductions in demand for gasoline and jet fuel. The Maya 2-1-1 spread was at a historically low point during the year and averaged $12.63 per barrel. 2020 crude throughput was limited to an average of 223,000 barrels per day as we actively managed operations to match the reduced market demand. Refining margins are expected to move sideways until demand for gasoline and jet fuel improves. We plan to continue operating the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. We remain diligent with efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at our Houston Refinery and we'll continue to evaluate production decisions as the market evolves. Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. EBITDA was $45 million during the fourth quarter and was $324 million for the full year. Fourth quarter Technology profitability declined due to a lower number of licensing revenue recognition milestones. Catalyst margins increased due to inventory mix improvements probably offset by decrease in volumes as customers managed year-end inventories. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones and improving catalyst demand, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability to improve to a similar level as in the first quarter of 2019. Please turn to Slide 19 for a refreshed view of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a clear and straightforward strategy to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation, while moderating our capital expenditure budget to $2 billion or less for each of the next three years. The formula is simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should improve free cash flow at any point in business cycles. Let me summarize the year's highlights and outlook with Slide 20. During 2020 LyondellBasell remained true to our strategy of capturing value and delivering resilient results at all points in the cycle. We delivered on our commitments to investors, served our customers and supported our employees, while moving forward on sustainability initiatives. By maximizing cash generation and prioritizing liquidity, we maintained our investment grade rating and extended the continuity of our dividend. Demand for consumer-driven goods remained strong and durable goods markets are rebounding with increased industrial activity. As global mobility improves, we expect that demand and margin for fuels from our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses will follow. Over the past several years LyondellBasell has captured opportunities through disciplined and profitable growth investments whether building, acquiring or partnering on assets. Our company focused on leveraging our technology, building on our advantages and increasing our earnings capacity. Our path is clear. LyondellBasell will remain focused on meeting our commitments and pursuing a disciplined financial strategy. With robust cash generation and ample liquidity, we plan to continue strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio during 2021. We look forward to sharing our progress toward developing more circular business models for our industry and creating a more supportive culture for our workforce that will allow all of us to continue delivering sustainable results for years to come. In summary, our strategy has served us well and now LyondellBasell is poised to emerge from this pandemic with more earnings power and free cash flow potential. We are now pleased to take your questions. David Kinney : Hello, Amanda, are you on mute? Operator : Can you hear me, sir? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, we can. Operator :  Our first question comes from Steve Byrne. Your line is open. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. On the topic of sustainability, I'm curious to hear your estimate of your - can you hear me okay? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Yes. Go ahead. There is a bit of background noise. Amanda, perhaps this is on your side. Go ahead Steve. Steve Byrne : Okay. The - what fraction of your polyethylene volumes are sold in their end markets, where customers are asking for some type of a sustainable product? I'm curious to hear your view, whether this is a push by your initiatives or is this being pulled by the end market customers that you're selling into? And of that fraction, how would you split it into the three buckets that you're working in? You have the mechanical recycling JV with SUEZ, you have the pyrolysis molecular recycling project, and then you also have the bio-based feedstock project with Neste. Which of those three do you think are really driving us? Or do you think those end market customers are really above the line? Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Steve. Good morning. First of all, in terms of how much of our polyethylene demand our customers are asking for sustainable products, I mean, if you think about our sales of polyethylene more than half of it goes in the packaging, whether it's flexible or blow molded bottles or those sorts of things. So I think it's safe to say more than half, probably close two thirds over time, we'll want to have sustainable products as part of the mix that we sell them. In terms of their preference, for food packaging, clearly, the molecular recycling would be the most desirable because essentially what we're doing is we're creating new feedstock and producing FDA approved resin. So our molecular recycling will be the most important development as we look at the next five to seven years, but I think mechanical recycling will continue to play a role. And that's where we're capturing the near-term opportunities. And as you know, we have a molecular recycling pilot plant that we built in Italy. We're working - I had a review with my R&D team, in fact, this week, and they are working diligently to perfect the technology and get to semi works as soon as possible. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort. Your line is open. Bob Koort, your line is open. Bob Koort : Thanks very much. Bob, I was hoping you could give us an update on how the commercialization of your two new JVs is progressing, and maybe some milestones there? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, so good morning, Bob. Things are going very well. So I'll start with Bora. We have - we've stacked up in the marketing side, both sales and customer service. We have a full-fledged organization. Local leadership in China ramping up our marketing efforts to sell more directly rather than through trading activities. So we're selling 100% of the polymer output over there in Bora, and things are going quite well. I will tell you it's increased our visibility on the market and demand trends. And so all the things we thought would occur when we had a bigger presence. We're starting to see that. Sasol JV, we're operating the facility as part of the agreement. We have - the site manager is a LyondellBasell employee. He was a site manager of one of our sites here in Houston. The marketing of the products is just part of our usual marketing that we do on other polyethylene grades that we already producing. So my sense is that the integration has been very seamless. And both JVs are really now part of the system. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan. Your line is open. Arun Viswanathan : All right. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on, again the polyethylene market as well as the polypropylene markets. So in polyethylene, I guess, conditions have definitely held up a lot better than what lot of us had thought. And now with the durables, market kind of recovering. I guess, do you expect maybe a little bit of give back in Q2 as operating rates pick up, and we see little bit more supply coming to the market? Or do you expect kind of price resilience? And then in polypropylene, maybe similar questions we've seen a real surge in monomer. And so how does that kind of translate to your outlook for polymer pricing and margins downstream? Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : Good morning, Arun. Both are very tight. So let me talk about polyethylene first. Speaking for ourselves and inventory is still very low. In fact, we're looking for opportunities to build back some inventory, but because demand is so strong, we're not able to do that. On the pricing front January price increase discussions are essentially finished and the implementation of the increase is going to occur. The next increase for February is on the table and likely there will be very good discussion about that as well. If you think about markets being tight in January, typically as we go into the spring, we see a seasonal uptick in demand. And so I think that supply-demand fundamentals are going to remain tight through the first half of the year for polyethylene. And polypropylene, similarly, as you said, propylene prices run up quite a lot. But inventories are still low, we're struggling to build inventory because demand is so good. And as you said about durables, probably applies more to polypropylene. As the economic recovery really takes hold in Europe and U.S., I think we're going to see probably more pool from durable goods end uses. So we're quite constructive of about both frankly. It looks tight through the first half of the year. And the other thing I would add is, there is quite a bit of downtime on - a planned downtime in the industry for crackers. So that's going to keep monomer prices probably high through the first half of the year. There is also a very large PDH turnaround here on the Gulf Coast. So that will keep propylene pretty strong through May, I would imagine. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews : Bob maybe just to follow up on the polyethylene demand. In one of the slides, the capacity utilization slide, you put the scenario out there where demand could grow 7% in 2021. And I'm just wondering if you could bridge us between the sort of 4% expectation and what would get it up to 7%. And within that, as a follow-up to one of your earlier comments on sort of expecting the normal seasonal improvement in demand in the second and third quarter, does the COVID environment minimize that at all with everybody at home, and what have you or do you think we'll still see the same seasonality in demand? Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : Sure, Vincent. So, first of all, what we were trying to illustrate with that chart is that it won't take much for the operating rates to just go flat from here, 3% additional demand in one year. Now, typically in recovery years, we've seen demand growth above trend line in the first year or even two post recessions. To your question about how do you bridge the 4 to the 7, first of all, in polyethylene, here in the U.S. the pipe market has been very, very weak. And if there is an infrastructure bill as oil and gas starts to come back a bit, I think that could help demand growth here in the U.S. and likely if there's infrastructure spending in Europe in China, I mean you could really see that market contribute to bringing the 4 to 7. The other is --there still enough durable goods content or industrial demand or for example like industrial bulk containers. As industrial activity picks up, I think, we'll see recovery or higher demand rates for polyethylene. So I don't think it would take much to get to the 7%. And when you factor that in, it looks like operating rates could stay elevated through over the next few years. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Sison. Your line is open. Mike Sison : Nice end of the year. Bob, it sounds like Schulman worked out really well, I guess, similar to our brands, so hopefully enjoyed the season. But are there any other opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions? Your balance sheet is in good shape, maybe to add to that advanced materials segment. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So we are pleased with how the APS segment has really evolved. What I'm most pleased about is that the integration is essentially complete. And so now as we face into recovering markets, the increase in volume should increase earning will see those synergies go straight to the bottom line. And that's really ahead of us. So the best is in still in part of us for APS, hopefully the same for our brands. In terms of bolt-on acquisitions, yes, I mean, we're out - we now that the platform is essentially set. It would be very natural if we could find opportunities to bolt-on and add to the segments that are most attractive to us. So we're keeping a watchful eye for that and we'll keep you updated. But given the kind of acquisitions that are possible, the size will be very modest, and it will be more about just roll-ups. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Bob, with regards to propylene, the three explanations that we often hear for supply constraints are low refinery operating rates, PDH outages and a light feedstock mix yielding diminish quantities of propylene co-product. Can you speak to those and your view of the sustainability of this tightness in propylene monomer? It's not often we see prices rise $0.22 a pound over a two month period. And so I'm just curious to hear your view on that. Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Kevin, it's kind of reminiscent of like 10 years ago when we used to see a lot more volatility, and generally when propylene gets close to being sold out any outage causes these kinds of burst in price. I would add a fourth item to your list, which is very robust demand for the derivatives of propylene, not just polypropylene, but the other propylene derivatives, cumene and derivatives and so on. So we've really had a strong pull from all propylene derivatives, which has helped. I think until the PDH outages or turnarounds are behind us, I think we're going to have tightness in propylene. The other thing is propane is very far out today, so - as economic feedstock. So maybe if propane cracking returns in the summer when propane gets cheaper, you could see a little bit more propylene supply. But my sense is that we have a pretty tight propylene market, probably through May. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Bob I was just wondering if you could discuss business conditions in Olefins and Polyolefins in Europe and maybe compare them to what they were like in 2019? That is - what is it about the European market going into 2021 that seems to be so strong? And do you see that sustainably strong? Bhavesh Patel : Sure. Great question. So as you've probably read Jeff that there has been higher incidence of COVID in Europe, lockdowns in various countries, but we've not seen significant impact on demand for Polyolefins. So Polyolefins demand has been has been still very resilient. If you look at EAI across the board and, of course, a lot of that Europe, if you think about our volume - if you compare Q1 '21, how our book is building compared to Q1 '19, we expect that ethylene is going to be up about 15% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21, polyethylene up 17%, polypropylene up 12%, Q1 '19 to Q1 '21. So it really points to very resilient demand. And as you look forward into the turnaround season, very heavy turnaround season also in Europe, in fact, in April, about 13% of the ethylene capacity is expected to be offline on a planned basis. So I mean, I think we could see tightness through a good bit of the first half of the year based on demand hanging in there even when there spike of COVID rates in various countries. And as the vaccine is distributed, I would think, all of that will settle down and the demand growth we should see year-over-year. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning guys. First question just around polyethylene capacity globally. So how much of effective new polyethylene capacity do you think ran in 2020 versus '19? And then does that number get bigger or smaller on your numbers as we go into 2020? And then the second one is, with Shell Pennsylvania plant, when that comes on, just because of its geographic advantage to some customers, do you think that will be more disruptive than an average plant that would start up in the Gulf Coast? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So Duffy, your first question, 2020 was a pretty heavy year for start-ups. So, including our new Hyperzone Polyethylene plant here in La Porte, I think '21, at least based on the schedules that we've seen that are publicly available, '21 should be lighter. And then in '22, we'll see more expansions come through. And that's what's reflected in that supply demand graph on Page 11 of our earnings materials on our slides. So I mean, I think, again, if you go back to what we talked about in the prepared materials, if we have recovery kind of growth in '21, at 7% or something, I think we essentially can absorb what's coming globally. Your question about the Shell plant that we'll start up in Pennsylvania, yes, I mean, certainly there will be temporary dislocation. They'll have to - they will find their way into the market, they'll export some product. But much like when, for example, Sasol started up, there was a quarter - there was a - for quarter, for a month or two, when these large plant start-up. But eventually as long as kind of the overall demand is such that the supply is needed, it tends to find its way to where the demand is. So I don't expect a massive disruption, but I would imagine we'll see some bumps when they do start up. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed. Your line is open. Hassan Ahmed : Bob question around two commodities, one on ethylene. As you take a look at the cost curve right now, who would you think is setting the ethylene price? And only reason I asked that is that obviously we've seen a major escalation in the price of Chinese coal? So that's one part. And the other question is around styrene. It seems Q4 volumes are very strong. What are you guys seeing in the near term as far as the styrene market goes as well? Bhavesh Patel : Okay. So first of all, your question about the prices that are - you're right, the coal price has gone up quite a lot. So I would say CTO and MTO are probably setting the price. It's quite close. And given the high level of demand for ethylene derivatives, some MTO-based ethylene is still needed in China. So I would say those are the price setters. And your second question about styrene. We've already seen styrene come back off again. So we had really nice period in November or early December, but styrene has come back off. I think the way to think about styrene is when all the units are running, the margins will be pretty weak in styrene. Think when there are outages, we could see some improvement, but we're not expecting a lot in terms of contribution from styrene in 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar. Your line is open. PJ Juvekar : Bob, this strong pricing in polyethylene in December, January and February, three sort of unseasonal months, is that driven by global inventory build, if underlying demand is flat sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And if it is - that inventory build, usually converters try to buy ahead of this price increases. So I guess my question is, are they trying to scramble to buy right now? And if they buy too much, do we end up with too much inventory in second half? Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Good question. I mean it is - the price strength has been somewhat unusual. But I think, the supply side, so we looked at carefully with the hurricanes that came through the U.S., there were some unplanned outages in Europe, there was just enough to really firm up the market. Speaking for ourselves, we can barely keep up with orders let alone allow any kind of pre-buy. So our team is essentially under pretty strict instructions to not allow pre-buy because we simply don't have the inventory to do it. We're just trying to meet the demand for customers. And many customers are saying, hey, if you're three days late, we're going to run out of product. So I think we find ourselves in a really tight environment. And I think if there is some softness, let's say in February, I can tell you for us, we're going to take the opportunity to selectively build back inventory and get ready for the spring season, which we expect to be robust like usual. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Bob, how are you thinking about Refining and Oxyfuels profitability as the world comes - gets back to normal? And '22, if it is a normal year, how do you think about the return to earnings of those two businesses? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, I mean, we're looking forward to and both are contributing again. It's been, as you know, a pretty challenging period. In Oxyfuels we had trouble moving the volume. It's just the margins and have been essentially zero. So part of what I think we - how you should think about LyondellBasell is that recovery and the related earnings are still in front of us. So as driving recovers, we don't even need air travel to recover back to the original or pre-COVID levels. If driving recovers with vaccinations and more domestic travel, we could really see both Refining and Oxyfuels contribute in the second half. And I think that's part of the earnings growth story as vaccinations become more common. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard. Your line is open. Jonas Oxgaard : I was wondering about your feed slate, propane spike and the relative profitability seems to have flipped very rapidly. So question is what does that do to your Q1 margins? And how is your feed slate evolving here? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. It's good question. So we're really minimizing propane if cracking any at all. We have kind of what we call a barbell feed slate today, it's ethane and it's liquids. So gasoline, naphtha still look decent. And so we're either in ethane or with the other end of the spectrum. And both are profitable given where propylene is and butadiene - you know it's come off a little bit, but still hanging in there. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Yefremov. Your line is open. Alex Yefremov : So I've noticed, typically U.S. exports about half of produced polyethylene. When global freight rates went up, it didn't seem to hurt U.S. polyethylene supply-demand dynamics, but only help that. Could you explain why? Bhavesh Patel : So, first of all, I mean, I think you have to look at overall demand globally. And if the demand is such that the supply is needed, we find ways to get to meet the demand. Our - so you may be referring, a little bit to the container dislocations and so on. For us, we've not really been impacted by that much. We have long-term contracts. We've been able to continue our exports, primarily down to Latin America and Mexico, but also to Asia. So our exports have been uninterrupted and not really impacted by the spot freight rates or container rates. So we continue this business as usual for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Bob, I wanted to come back to the polyethylene Slide 11, you mentioned that 2020 global demand growth was 4%. You guys sold 8% as I do the math between the U.S. and Europe. So could you talk about your operating rate? I mean, obviously, some of that is a Hyperzone capacity that was added. But I was wondering where you're operating rates were and if you could say that relative to the industry average in the sector? And as I'm looking at this chart, is this factoring in any delays whatsoever in terms of Chinese capacity? Or are you factoring in what the press releases have said there? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, so good morning Frank, or good afternoon. We - so, operating rates in the second half of the year for us in polyethylene were essentially unconstrained. We ran as much as we could. We had some unplanned downtime in Europe and the U.S., but we've essentially been running full since about July-August timeframe. And we expect to do that for the foreseeable future. And, yes, the volume growth was related to Hyperzone operating for part of the year. Your question about the supply side, on that chart on Page 11, we have not put any delays in for Chinese capacity. So it's essentially - we're assuming it's going to come on as advertised in IHS. It's really - that's to illustrate the impact of 7% growth versus 4% growth. How close we are to really having absorbing all of the capacity that's in front of us if we just have one year of more typical economic recovery type growth at 7%. Operator :  Our next question comes from John Roberts. Your line is open. John Roberts : You indicated that the balance sheet focus was going to be on debt reduction. Would it be helpful to your credit metrics if the Sasol option came earlier to you and you get full access to the cash flow there? Or would it be better if that comes later given you got to focus on getting your debt down right now? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, John, I mean, I think, clearly, our focus is to get the debt down now. I don't think that option is going to come sooner. So I think it's a very low probability. Given kind of the earnings profile, I think we could manage, but I don't think that's a plausible scenario. So our focus in terms of capital allocation is debt reduction, first and foremost the modest increases in the dividend and then perhaps buybacks, but those are pretty far away I think. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Blair. Your line is open. Matthew Blair : Bob could you talk about your net long ethylene position in the U.S.? Are you able to capitalize on this recent spike up in spot ethylene? And then also, have you started to explore ethylene just given the startup of some new export facilities? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So, Matthew it's our Sasol acquisition. There has been - we've been fortunate with the timing because ethylene values have gone up, and we've increased our merchant position as a result of acquiring half of that facility. We are not exporting, but we have benefited from the increase in spot price. First and foremost, as you know, has a spot price moves that impacts the contract negotiations. So contract price has been moving up. Most of our formulas have spot contract plans. So we benefit that way. And some of - quite a bit of Sasol volume does have spot sales in it. So we've been able to capitalize on this improvement in ethylene margins that I think we'll probably be persistent through most of the first half of the year because of this very high unplanned turnaround schedule starting in March. Operator : And our last question comes from John McNulty. Your line is open. Bhavesh Mahesh Lodaya : This is Mahesh Lodaya up for John. When we look at the volume recovery for polypropylene, we are back to a close to pre-pandemic levels. However, we are obviously still going to see demand recovery from some of the key autos, commercial construction in some of those end markets. So how much of the pre-pandemic base demand has now recovered? And then how much of new permanent ongoing demand was created by the pandemic itself? Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. Great question. So I'm going to give you statistics for the first part of your question, and then I'll talk kind of qualitatively about the second half. So if you look at our polypropylene volumes, I'll tell you how Q1 '21, we think is shaping up compared to Q1 '19. In the U.S., we're likely up 14% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21, and in EAI, up 12%. Another sort of data point is that polypropylene demand in China grew about 10% from 2019 to '20. Now, your second question about pandemic-related, certainly the masks and the medical gowns and all of that, it's been pretty important driver. And frankly, I think even after vaccinations are more widespread, use of masks will still be pretty and I think for most of this year and maybe even into next year. So it's - I don't have a number for you on what percent of the growth was accounted for by the masks. But if I were to estimate, maybe 1% to 2% of the growth is related to masks of the 14% that I mentioned for the Americas polypropylene growth. Bhavesh Patel : All right. So I think that was our last question. I'd like to just offer a few closing remarks before I let you all go. Thank you for hanging in there. So first of all, with the completion of 2020, you've seen the resilient performance from our company through the first significant downturn since our emergence back in 2010. Our fourth quarter results have given you a preview of our increased earnings power. Going into 2021, we have more assets, strong order books, tight markets and rising economic activity. All of which should provide confidence for continuing improvement into the first quarter. While much of our industry is scheduling high levels of second quarter maintenance, LyondellBasell's planned downtime for 2021 is relatively light. Our assets are ready to capture improving seasonal demand, Refining and Oxyfuels businesses are poised to benefit from increased mobility during the second half of the year. I think all of this positions us well to increase cash flow and continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we work our way through 2021. So thank you for your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you in about 90 days. Have a great weekend. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell first quarter 2021 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bhav Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. Before we get into the discussion of our results, I would like to take a moment to recognize the tremendous progress that has been made in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and how much hard work still needs to be done around the world to reduce the effects of this disease. While financial markets are focused on the economic upside being enabled by increased vaccination and the eventual reopening, today our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities where we operate in India in particular as well as Brazil and even parts of Europe are still suffering from terribly high case rates and fatalities. We are working closely with governments around the world to do our part to advance immunity for our employees and their communities and to hasten and end to the devastation brought on by this virus. Our thoughts remain with those most affected by this pandemic. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Bhav and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 and let me begin by highlighting our track record of strong cash conversion. Over the last 12 months, LyondellBasell converted almost 80% of her EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. In the first quarter of 2021, our business has delivered over 40% more free operating cash flow relative to the same period last year. We expect continued improvement of our LCM performance as we progressed through each quarter of 2021. Let's turn to Slide 11 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment during the first quarter. As Bhav mentioned, our goal for this year is to accomplish meaningful deleveraging to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. In the first quarter, while paying dividends of $352 million and investing a similar amount in capital expenditures, we reduced the balance on our term loan by $500 million to close the first quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.8 billion. After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $500 million on the term loan in April. We expect that robust cash generation should enable continued progress on deleveraging throughout the year. Before I continue with a more detailed discussion of our segment results, let me provide a brief update on our 2021 modeling guidance. We continue to be on track to invest approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures during 2021. Target equally towards profit generating growth projects and sustaining maintenance. Due to extremely strong demand for propylene oxide, we have shifted a turnaround at one of our PO/TBA units in Bayport, Texas from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year and reduced the scope and associated downtime for the maintenance. With this change, we expect no major planned maintenance downtime in the second quarter of 2021 and based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that the third quarter EBITDA impact due to lost production associated with planned maintenance across the company will increase by $30 million to $75 million. In total, the impact associated with all of LyondellBasell\u2019s 2021 planned maintenance downtime should decreased by $30 million relative to our original guidance to approximately $140 million for the year. Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our quarterly profitability. In the first quarter of 2021 LyondellBasell\u2019s business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $1.6 billion. This was an improvement of more than $300 million relative to the fourth quarter, exceeding typical first quarter seasonal trends. The upward trajectory of LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability reflects improving demand and margins for products driven by the recovery global economy and tight markets. As Bob mentioned, cold weather and associated power outages resulted in unplanned shutdowns that constrained first quarter production for LyondellBasell and nearly all of our competitors in the state of Texas. This downturn was exacerbated by strong global demand that tightened markets and elevated margins across most of our businesses. While it's clear that we lost production during the first quarter due to unplanned downtime, the offsetting effects of higher margins and sales from inventory complicates the effort to quantify the impact on first quarter business results. In the second quarter, we plan to operate our assets at nearly full rates as profitability improves for Oxyfuels and Refining businesses. We expect further EBITDA improvement during the second quarter. On the left side of the chart, our all-time high quarterly EBITDA excluding LCM of approximately $2.2 billion reported in the third quarter of 2015 provides useful perspective. While profitability for transportation fuels was quite strong in 2015, today our company has more earnings power from a larger asset base. Over the last six years, we have added ethylene capacity at Corpus Christi, expanded our compounding business to the acquisition of A. Schulman, started a new Hyperzone HDPE plant in Houston and added significant joint venture capacity in Louisiana and China. In 2021, LyondellBasell is poised to capture opportunities that are emerging in the rebounding global economy with a larger asset base. Now, let's review the first quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results excluding the non-cash impacts of LCM inventory changes. I will begin with our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 13. Third quarter EBITDA was $867 million, $145 million higher than the fourth quarter. Tight markets and strong demand resulted in improved margins driving quarter results higher than we've seen since 2015. Olefin results increased approximately $155 million compared to the fourth quarter. Olefin\u2019s margins increased with higher ethylene and propylene prices outpacing higher feedstock and utility costs. Volumes decreased due to downtime driven by Texas weather events partially offset by a full quarter of volume from our Louisiana joint venture that we formed in December. The ethylene cracker at the joint venture ran continuously throughout the weather events and exceeded ethylene nameplate operating rates by 9% during March. Polyolefin results for the segment decreased by about $15 million during the first quarter. Polyethylene margin decreased while polypropylene margin improved. Polyethylene volume increased due to a full quarter of contribution from the Louisiana joint venture, partially offset by lost production during the weather events. We anticipate both volume and margin improvement for our O&P Americas segment during the second quarter. Volumes are expected to rebound in the absence of weather-related downtime. Tight markets due to high demand, low inventories and customer backlogs are expected to continue to support strong integrated chain margins. Now, please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia and international segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $412 million, $161 million higher than the fourth quarter. Strong demand, expanded margins driving quarterly results higher than we have seen for the segment since 2018. Olefins results increased $30 million driven by increased margins and volumes. Ethylene margin improved due to increased ethylene prices and lower fixed costs despite higher feedstock costs. Demand was robust during the quarter and we increased volumes by operating our crackers at a rate of 98% almost 10% above industry benchmarks for the first quarter.  Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $150 million compared to the prior quarter. Strong polymer demand drove spread improvements for both polyethylene and polypropylene prices relative to monomer. Margin improvements at our Middle East and Asia joint ventures were offset by higher LPG feedstock costs, pressuring profitability at our new joint venture in China resulted in little change in equity income for the segment. During the second quarter, we expect strong demand and tight markets to drive further margin improvement for O&P-EAI businesses. Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $182 million, $14 million lower than the prior quarter. Margins improved with higher product prices while volumes declined due to the Texas weather events and planned maintenance in our propylene oxide and derivatives business. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results decreased by approximately $35 million due to lower volumes offsetting stronger margins driven by tight market supply. Intermediate chemical results decreased about $55 million due to lower volumes as a result of the weather events. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by approximately $25 million as a result of higher margins benefiting from improved gasoline prices that were partially offset by constrained volumes. We expect both volumes and margins to improve for our I&D segment in the second quarter. Strong demand for durable goods coupled with continued tight market supply are expected to increase profitability across most of the businesses in the segment. Now, let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. First quarter EBITDA was $135 million, $9 million higher than the fourth quarter. Volumes improved driven by higher demand for our products partially offset by lower margins. Compounding and solution results were relatively unchanged with higher volumes driven by improved demand being offset by compressed margins due to rising feedstock costs. Advanced polymer results increased by approximately $50 million due to both higher margins and volumes. In April, North American feedstock costs for our polypropylene compounds rapidly declined to reverse much of the price escalation that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that falling feedstock prices combined with continued price improvements were compounded products will expand margins during the second quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was negative $110 dollars. A $36 million decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher cost for renewable fuel credits or rens and lower crude throughput overwhelmed improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry crack spread. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased by $5.21 per barrel to $15.32 per barrel. As a result of the Texas weather event, the average crude throughput at the refinery fell to 152,000 barrels per day. In April, we continue to see improvements in refined product demand and we are running the refinery at nearly full rates. Strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve both volumes and margins at our refinery during the second half of this year. However, we don't expect a full recovery until there is further progress in vaccination rates and a rebound in global demand for jet fuel, driven by increased business and international air travel.  Please turn to Slide 18, as we review the results of our Technology segment. First quarter Technology segment EBITDA was $94 million, $49 million higher than the prior quarter. Catalyst profitability increased with customers rebuilding inventories and increased demand from Asia and the Middle East. Based on anticipated timing of upcoming licensing milestones and catalyst demand, we expect that second quarter technology business profitability will be similar to the first quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bhav. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 19. We began this year with low inventories and increasing demand from a recovering global economy. During our fourth quarter earnings call in January, we thought that strong February order books, increasing seasonal demand, and tight industry supply would support strong margins for at least the first half of 2021. Since January, our industry lost several weeks of supply due to Texas weather events during February and deferred maintenance from 2020 is resulting in high levels of planned downtime across the industry, particularly in the second quarter. North American inventories were depleted during the downtime and European inventories have been pressured by unusually strong first quarter demand. While our company normally maintains over one month of polyolefins sales inventory, our European PE and PP businesses ended March at levels well below those targets, most notably with less than two weeks of low density polyethylene inventory.  Logistics constraints are exacerbating the situation due to shortages of shipping containers on critical routes and escalating freight rates that are limiting opportunities for regional arbitrage. China remains structurally short of polyethylene. And U.S. exports to China have vanished as North American suppliers seek to replenish inventories and address order backlogs from domestic customers. Backlogs for finished goods are rising as the recovering global economy continues to be supported by government stimulus and pent-up demand emerges with increased vaccination rates. In summary, we believe that tight global markets are likely to persist well into the second half of this year and continued improvements in mobility and associated economic activity could sustain strong volumes and margins into 2022. Please turn to Slide 20 and let's review LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. In the years following the 2008 Great Recession, our company nimbly captured the benefits of low cost feedstocks that arose from the development of North American oil and gas resources. LyondellBasell typically delivered between $6 billion to $7 billion of EBITDA over the past 10 years. Our EBITDA after LCM inventory adjustments reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our company. At the end of 2019, we thought we might simply be coming to the end of a very long business cycle, until we learn more about COVID and the extreme tolls it would take on our society, the economy and ultimately in human lives.  As we rebound from the pandemic and contemplate how our company could perform through the recovery in the next business cycle it is worthwhile to consider the factors that should provide additional earnings power relative to our performance last year and in the previous cycle. Recovery in automotive and other durable goods demand is rebuilding volumes within our new APS segment back towards 2018 levels. Increased utilization of our capacity should provide greater visibility on the more than $200 million in synergies that we've built into the business since acquiring A. Schulman. In 2020 we added 500,000 tons of polyethylene capacity utilizing our next generation hyper zone technology. During the depths of the pandemic and recession our strong balance sheet enabled us to move forward and form accretive joint ventures for integrated crackers in China and Louisiana that provided immediate returns on our investments. This quarter we finalized an agreement to form our second propylene oxide joint venture with Sinopec.  Beyond the broad-based margin improvements that are currently underway for many of our products, full recovery and demand for transportation fuels still lies ahead and should drive margin improvement for our sizable refining and oxyfuels businesses over the coming quarters.  Our larger asset base is well-poised to capture the opportunities of a recovering economy, establish new earnings benchmarks, and position LyondellBasell for further growth over the upcoming business cycle.  Coming close with Slide 21. The title of our 2020 annual report is Emerging Stronger and it is an appropriate description of LyondellBasell\u2019s trajectory as the global economy recovers from the pandemic and recession. Our leading and advantaged business positions are primed to capture the benefits of a recovering economy. In the second quarter, we have no measure planned downtime and we are operating our highly reliable and low-cost global network of assets at maximum rates to capture rising margins. We've remained steadfast to our disciplined financial strategy. Over the coming year, our priority will continue to be deleveraging while supporting shareholder returns with a strong and progressive dividend. We remain committed to an investment grade credit rating and our plan is to bolster our credit metrics through increased earnings and additional debt reduction over the coming quarters. Our aim is to maximize free cash flow by leveraging our larger asset base efficiently converting earnings into cash and deploying capital in a prudent manner towards high-return investments. All of this will help drive our ultimate focus on delivering strong shareholder returns. The outlook for our business is quite promising. And we look forward to delivering our commitments over the coming quarters. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator :  Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. If your peak EBITDA in 2015 was $8 billion, what do you think your peak EBITDA is now after you bring on your 2023 expansions? Michael McMurray : So, good morning Jeff and for everyone, thanks for your patience with our longer prepared remarks, there's a lot going on. So, we wanted to provide color. So Jeff in terms of peak EBITDA, if you think about the kind of mid-cycle margins up to now we've added between $1 billion and $1.2 billion of EBITDA. In 2023, we\u2019ll add another $500 million with our Sinopec PO-SM project and the PO-TBA project. So, I would say at mid-cycle margins we've added $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of EBITDA. And if you - were to consider peak earnings then it would be something even more than that. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open. P.J. Juvekar: First of all, I like your brand names circular and recover, revive - recover, revive and renew. It was very nice. Bhavesh Patel : Well, thank you. P.J. Juvekar: My question is on regular polyethylene. You know you talked a lot about higher polyethylene demand and during COVID time on Slide 9. Can you discuss how much of the capacity - on the capacity side, how much of capacity possibly was delayed due to COVID? Because there are some numbers out there above 1 million to 2 million tons of capacity delayed. And then just any - I saw something in the - news headlines about phase 2 of Bora joint venture. Can you also talk a little bit about that? Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Sure, P.J. So, first of all in terms of capacity delays, I think in China we should assume that capacity will come on part of schedule for those projects that are already underway. I think for projects that haven't started in China, certainly the CTO and MTO projects are probably at risk. And we've learned recently that government is considering canceling those projects for the environment. In the U.S. because of COVID, the projects that are underway maybe were delayed a quarter or two especially Q2, Q3 last year. As there were slowdowns until we all figured out how to manage density in our sites and construction sites. So, maybe a couple of quarters for those projects that are underway. And if you think longer term, projects that CTO/MTO based in China could be at risk. Mike? Michael McMurray : Oh in Bora, question about Bora phase 2. So we're still discussing with our partner on Bora phase 2. No definitive decisions yet. I would say that would be middle of the decade or beyond in terms of product hitting the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. I was curious to hear how your marketing of the polyethylene out of Lake Charles may have changed since it was solely run and managed by Sasol. And maybe more importantly, this broader share position you have in the U.S. market, are you picking up anything from your customer relationships where the industry might be trying to allocate more tons into this premium market to capture that premium versus spot pricing ex-U.S.? Michael McMurray : Yes, so good morning Steve. On the Sasol marketing, so pre-pandemic our view was that we would plug that volume into our global network and sell in Europe and in China and also supplement in the U.S. So, that's still our plan. But in the near term, because of the supply disruptions really spot sales have been zero. We've been on allocation. So, exports are only those where we have contracts. We're not doing spot exports. We don't have enough volume today. And our inventories are below our typical levels. So, our focus in the near-term will be to meet domestic demand, which is - which we still don't know what level that demand is, because of the supply constraints. And then, we'll look to resume exports. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the good results here. Just want to get your thoughts on PE inventories and kind of the outlook for the next couple of quarters. Obviously as you noted, the storm reduced those inventories materially. And how do you see those evolving over the next couple of quarters? When do you expect that we'll be back at normal? And what does that imply for the next couple of price increases that have been announced? Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : Yes thank you, Arun. First of all in inventory, I was actually just looking at that data this morning. The industry data and industry inventories both PE and PP are below typical levels that we've seen in the past. Again, I think following on from what I answered to Steve earlier, we still don't know what's the level of demand. My guess is the level of demand is higher than what we saw in February and March. And so, our first priority is to meet the demand of our customers and then find the opportunity to rebuild inventory. So, if you think about what's ahead, we still have reopening ahead in the U.S. We are reopening ahead in Europe, many parts of Asia, ex-China still reopening ahead so, stronger demand period. Typically, we see seasonal improvement so opportunity to rebuild inventory, we may not have that until later in Q3. Also recall that there's a lot of planned downtime in the industry because many producers deferred planned maintenance last year into this year. So, I think all of these reasons are why the setup looks to be for a very tight market for most of this year if not all. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Sir, your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Bhav, the spread between polypropylene resin and propylene monomer has widened quite a bit since October. I think $0.21 per pound or so. Perhaps you have a slightly different number. But my question is, what is, the trajectory that you would foresee for that spread moving through the back half of the year? How sustainable is it given the inventory levels that you mentioned and your view of supply demand? Bhavesh Patel : So, Kevin on polypropylene you know more of it goes into durable goods than does polyethylene. And I'm sure all of our listeners have heard about the shortage of chips that have limited automobile production. I think that's going to cause more demand as some of those constraints relieve themselves and there's more chips available. And generally speaking auto sales are up. Inventories are low. Fleet sales have been low. Rental car fleets have been depleted last year. So, all of that has to be replenished. So, my sense is that polypropylene market will continue to be strong. And if I were to look at inventories the data that I saw this morning from an industry perspective in the U.S. PP inventories are actually lower than PE inventories. And this data that I'm citing is 60 days in the rear. So, my guess is that trend will continue to decline as we see data from March and April. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and hi, everyone. Bhav may be on polyethylene. You know there's a pretty FX spread now or arm spread between the U.S. and in Asia. I think it's the highest level ever. And you know usually those get our doubt. What do you think is going to happen? Do you think the Asian price is going to need to move up a lot more than the U.S. price is going to need to move down or how do you envision this playing out over the coming quarters? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So, Vincent first of all I think we have to differentiate between the polypropylene price and polypropylene spreads. The polypropylene price could continue to come down on an absolute basis as propylene comes down - polypropylene. But the spreads are widening. We've announced another spread increase, markets are very tight. So, my sense is that global prices will likely come up and as propylene comes down some or has come down in the last month, you could see polypropylene absolute price moderate where I think spreads will continue to widen because the market is very tight. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is  for John. Congrats on another strong quarter. So, following on your comments, you made it around cash deployment. Cash flows are obviously very strong this year and they will likely continue so as the new products come on line. You noted that you plan to pay down some more debt this year. So, what's the target leverage for you and how should we think about further allocation of capital like how should we think about buybacks and do you think this is the right setup given the high margins to maybe expand your organic CapEx beyond the $2 billion mark? Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So, let me start and then I'll ask Michael to add as well. Deleveraging continues to be our top priority. We want to get our debt to EBITDA metrics down below to an absolute debt in the $12 billion sort of range. And I think we're well-positioned to hit those kinds of numbers by year end. Based on what we see, a good trajectory of our earnings. Buybacks could certainly enter the picture after we reach these targets that we have, could be as soon as next year, early next year of that buybacks could be part of the picture. It\u2019s unlikely that will add to organic growth. We have our PO/TBA project that we're executing. We want to make sure we complete that. And beyond that, we don't have plans to start a new large organic project in the next 12 to 24 months.  Michael, anything else to add on capital allocation? Michael McMurray : Yes. I mean maybe just a couple of comments, Bhav. I mean just a reminder, you know, last year we generated very strong cash flow $3.4 billion from ops almost 90% conversion. We more than covered capital and our dividend. And that was I think pretty impressive. As Bhav said, we expect very strong cash flow generation this year. And we do expect to make meaningful progress in debt reduction. We've taken out a $1 billion of debt year-to-date. And I think kind of looking towards the end of the year, I think $3 billion to $4 billion in total debt reduction for the year is within reach. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Sison : Good morning. Nice start to the year. Bhav, in terms of your PE and TE effective operating rate right chart on Slide 9, there\u2019s a little dip there in 2022 and 2023. Is that considered mid-cycle in your outlook? And, if so, would you still be able to generate some EBITDA growth in LP in Americas and in 2022? Bhavesh Patel : Yes. So, Mike, yes, I mean that's kind of mid cycle or better than mid cycle. That dip if you look at the operating rate, it's still above 90%. And generally when operating rates are greater than 90% typically the seasonal highs tend to be very tight. So, Q2, Q3 tend to be tight quarters in an annual average net above 90%. So, my sense is we're going to be somewhere mid-cycle or better in 2022 and 2023. And then after that as there's really not a whole lot of new capacity ex-China we should see the cycle play out.  I wanted to also answer Vincent\u2019s question about polyethylene. Vincent, I thought you asked about polypropylene building on the prior question. On polyethylene spreads, you know the market is still extremely tight. So, our sense is that the price increases that have been implemented could remain in place through Q3. There are more increases out there. Market remains tight. And again, as I've said several times we really don't know where the real level of demand is because we've been on allocation and we know our customers want more if we had it. So, if we had the product. So, I think that these spreads should stay well into Q3 for polyethylene. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Good morning. Bhav, you just kind of made a comment working off your slide 9 that the dip you see coming kind of takes us to mid-cycle and then obviously better than that going forward. So, kind of the next five to seven years all look like they're better than mid-cycle. So, can you walk us through what that would mean for reinvestment economics for a new cracker in the U.S.? And then maybe touch on globally, obviously, with your catalyst business, you get a first look at what everybody's thinking about doing globally. How many new announcements for new crackers should we expect this year? Michael McMurray : Sure, Duffy. So first of all on a mid-cycle returns, yes, I think if you - first of all, if you look at that chart, it's actually probably better than mid-cycle other than maybe 2022. And again, if demand grows at 7% then I think you have a chance of actually having just a flat line and not much of a dip at all and we're headed in that direction it seems to me. So based on that and where CapEx has turned out recently on new projects. I still think it kind of leaves us that maybe low-double-digit kind of returns. And more importantly many companies who would think about investing are likely thinking about repairing their balance sheets from last year and paying down debt. So, I don't expect with this sort of a profile for there to be a rush in terms of new project announcements let\u2019s say ex-China, but let's see how it develops, each company has its own considerations. But certainly for us, we don't have plans to take on additional organic growth in O&P in the near-term. In terms of your question about what are we seeing from catalyst activity and licensing activity, we are seeing slower activity in China compared to what we saw over the last two years especially in polyethylene. So and we participate in most if not all tenders - that occur for a new project. So, it seems the activity is slowing compared to 2018 and 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Sir, your line is open. John Roberts : Yes hi, Bhav. Just to be in Slide 9 to debt here on the polyethylene outlook. Aren\u2019t the Chinese now building plants in three years so that anything beyond 2023 may not be in the consultant\u2019s forecast now for supply? Bhavesh Patel : Yes so, John first of all, I think Slide 9 is really important when you think - so we can't beat it to death enough I suppose. So, I would say that we're already into 2021, right. So, the forecasts out through 2025 are probably pretty firm in terms of what could be built and what sort of supply we should expect from China. Post 2025, it remains to be seen. But I would say 3.5 years something like that is the build time. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bob Koort : Thank you very much. I guess we'll keep beating away and Bhav on - you mentioned that time duration. I thought maybe in the Bora project you guys worked on the construction to commercial ops is a little bit faster. So, was there something unique to that project? Or what insights did you get from working with those guys there about what it might suggest across the industry in China as you can appreciate for a lot of investors the lack of transparency there makes it sort of difficult to handicap what's actually going to happen? Bhavesh Patel : Yes so, Bob on Bora remember, first of all, it was in the north which is a less congested area in terms of new projects up in Liaoning province. So - and we joined the project while it was already in construction and we restarted our discussions. And, of course, we signed the definitive agreements within a month or two of start-up. I still think Bob three to three and a half year is probably the right time to think about a project being approved to the time we have in production. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Bhav just on oxyfuels refining, can you discuss the improvement you're looking at for Q2 and even in the back half of the year? And refining do you think we'll have positive EBITDA next year in this business? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, so on oxyfuels we've already seen improvement as gasoline prices have come up and we've seen the blend premium come back a bit. So, it's recovered more than our base refining business has. We're getting closer to breakeven. David, my hope is that in Q3 we get to breakeven, in Q4 we're positive in the refining business. Now, that depends on the pace of reopening. I can tell you here in Houston the traffic is back in the evening when I drive home. It\u2019s I-10 coming out of Houston is full going both ways. So, I think more and more we're going to see the summer driving season could be very strong with a lot of pent-up demand for vacations and people wanting to get away. So, I think the refining business should see breakeven soon and positive profitability certainly by Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Your line is open. Matthew Blair : Great thanks. Good morning, Bhav. You know so many things going right here. Let me ask about the one area that's lagging of course and that's refining due these historic RIN obligations. Is there anything you can do to mitigate your exposure maybe by buying extra RINs forward or potentially looking at like a renewable diesel project? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, Matthew, you're right. The RINs have been quite a burden for us this year in our refining business. We're probably spending something like 3x more than we did last year on RINs. In the near term, I don't see anything else we can do. At some point the government will reset the mandate on RINs and then we could see the price moderate. But in the near term, we're doing all we can in terms of these renewable diesel sort of projects but that would be much more longer term and at the moment, we're not pursuing those sorts of projects in our refining business. So, we're just trying to run hard, run at maximum rates, and anticipate the recovery and miles driven. Operator : And our last question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Sir, your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Mr. Kinney. Good job saving the best for last. Very, very much appreciate it. Bhav, I was very struck by the comment that the market is going to be tight through the end of the year. Because I think just like two months ago the thought process was it would be tight through the end of the third quarter. So apparently, you've gained a little bit more visibility and feel that it's going to be tight through the end of the year? So that's obviously - that's pretty positive. And you're going to be operating full out in the second quarter which begs the question. Where were you guys in the first quarter on your O&P businesses in terms of operating rates? And as we look at the second quarter, where do you think the industry is going to be operating at in the O&P segments? Bhavesh Patel : Yes, So Frank on the operating rates I mean in Q1, we lost about 30 days of production on average in our Texas asset. One of our crackers was down for almost 90 days. So now, we\u2019re back-up and running fully. I suspect that - our competitors do have some planned downtime, maintenance that they had planned last year that was diverted into this year. So likely, our operating rate - on a plan basis is higher than most in Q2. Your earlier question about our confidence about the outlook I think, Frank, as time goes on. I just see the number of shortages on consumable items, on automobiles, lumber, steel. There's sort of like furniture, if you want to buy furniture, there's like a six-month delay from the time you ordered to the time you receive. And then reopening is still in front of us. I think there are so many factors that provide a very strong setup for how demand will develop for really all of our products in the company. So, that makes me more optimistic. About the fact that we'll have tighter markets for longer as we go through the year. So, thanks for your questions. Bhavesh Patel : I do have a few closing remarks if I may. First of all, really good questions as always in Slide 9 we\u2019ll continue to be part of our discussion as we go forward. I want to emphasize a couple of things. First of all, Q2 we're going to run full rates, no planned downtime. As I mentioned, there's a lot of backlog. We have reopening still in front of us. That should benefit our refining and oxyfuels business and continue to underpin demand strength in the other businesses that have been doing well. I think it's very important to note that with the larger asset base that we have, we've added $1 billion to $1.2 billion more of EBITDA as we sit here today at mid-cycle kind of margins. Now, clearly today we\u2019re well above mid-cycle margins in some of our businesses. So, I think that\u2019s a bit differential for LyondellBasell that in 2021 more assets deployed in a much, much stronger market. And I\u2019m really pleased that we can see a path to perhaps reaching our leverage targets by year-end both on a gross debt basis and on the debt to EBITDA metrics. So, that as I mentioned earlier brings buybacks kind of back into the equation as we think about capital allocation as we go into 2022. So, we look forward to giving you an update in July on our Q2 results. In the meantime, have a great and safe weekend. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell\u2019s second quarter 2021 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bhav Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by revealing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings which are available at our Investor Relations website. Additional documents on our Investor Relations website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures together with other disclosures including the earnings release. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 PM Eastern Time today until August 30 by calling 877-660-6853 in United States and 201-612-7415 outside United States. The passcode for both numbers is 13721413. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results in some cases, excluding the impact of lower cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bhav. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Dave. Good day to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Before we begin with the business discussion, I would like to acknowledge the sadness we are feeling throughout the LyondellBasell family after our tragic incident this week at our LaPorte facility, which resulted in the death of two contractors and injuries to several additional contractors and employees. Every day, we work diligently to ensure that the colleagues, the friends and most importantly, the families of our employees and contractors never have to receive the calls that went out last Tuesday evening, notifying them of the loss or injury of a loved one. Our investigation is underway and it will be sometime before we reach a conclusive determination regarding the cause of the incident. Our sincere condolences go out to the families of the two men lost in the incident and we pray for a fast and full recovery for all of the injured. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Bhav. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide Seven and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash generation, which has been enhanced by our recent growth investments. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the more than $4 billion. Our free operating cash flow yield has been 10.1% over the past four quarters and free operating cash flow for the second quarter, improved by more than 80% relative to the second quarter of 2019. We expect continued improvement of our last 12 months cash flow performance as we move forward through each quarter of 2021. Let's turn to Slide Eight and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the second quarter. As I've mentioned, during previous calls, a strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In the second quarter, we expressed our confidence in our outlook by increasing the quarterly dividend by 7.6% to $1.13 per share. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects during the quarter with approximately $430 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flow supported debt repayments of $1.3 billion, bringing our year to date debt reduction to $1.8 billion. We closed the second quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.5 billion. Last week S&P global ratings recognized the improvement in our metrics by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. We expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce our net debt by up to $4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. One modeling item of note, our original full year net interest expense guidance of $430 million did not include extinguishment cost associated with our accelerated debt repayment program. As a result, our 2021 net interest expense will likely exceed this prior guidance. Please turn to Slide Nine to review our quarterly profitability. In the second quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered record EBITDA of $3 billion. This was an improvement of more than $1.4 billion relative to the first quarter. Our results reflect robust demand for our products driven by the recovery global economy and our growth investments. Bhavesh Patel : Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 17. In the near to midterm, we are still in the early stages of the global economic recovery and despite the challenges from variance continued progress with vaccinations and reopening should continue to support robust demand and margins for our products. Pent up demand is tangible and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods as reopening proceeds globally. Low inventories due to supply constraints and logistics disruptions will only serve to extend tight market conditions. Downstream customer backlogs and persistent demand bode well for continued strength in LyondellBasell's order books. In polyethylene, strong US and Latin American demand has overtaken volumes that previously flowed from the US to export markets in Asia. As logistics constraints subside and US PV exports to Asia resume, producers will need to refill a depleted supply chain of 500,000 tons or more that is not fully captured in industry statistics. In North America, we expect markets for PV and PP will remain tight into next year. Higher vaccination rates are expected to improve global mobility over the coming year. The return of international travel will drive further recovery and transportation fuel's markets to increase profitability for our Oxyfuels and refining businesses providing additional earnings upside for LyondellBasell. Let me close with Slide 18. Our second quarter results provide clear evidence of LyondellBasell's progress and maximizing cash flow performance through all stages of the business cycle. We are leveraging our leading and advantage positions across a larger asset base to deliver results that far exceed our previous benchmarks. In today's strong markets, our second quarter EBITDA results are 38% higher than our previous record. By 2023, we expect that our recent growth investments will provide an additional $1.5 billion of mid cycle EBITDA earnings capability relative to 2017. Our value-driven growth investments should propel stronger performance in a variety of business environments. Our prudent financial strategy remains consistent. We have increased our quarterly dividend and remain confident in our capability to deliver on this commitment throughout business cycles. We are prioritizing de-leveraging and our rapid progress on debt repayment will serve to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. Capacity expansions are coming online in our industry during a period of extraordinary demand growth and enabling an orderly absorption of this new capacity into the market. Further investments in petrochemicals are proceeding at a manageable rate and recent project cancellations and delays demonstrate capital discipline by market participants. At LyondellBasell, we're focused on providing leadership for our industry to establish a more sustainable feature with new circular business models. We will increase our capacity to serve the growing market demand for circulum branded polymers produced from recycled and renewable feed stocks as we work toward our goal of annually producing two million tons of these products by 2030. LyondellBasell is capturing the strength of a rebounding economy. We aim to extend our track record of robust returns from our growing global business portfolio and look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming quarters. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question.  Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks. Thanks very much. At the end of the first quarter, Bob, you talked about how low your inventory is in Europe. Maybe yoU.Said they were 11 days. Can you talk about where your inventory is -- inventory days are now and secondly, have US contract polyethylene prices for July settled, and if they have settled, what was the change? Bhavesh Patel : All right, good morning, Jeff. Thank you for that question. On inventory, we are starting to restore inventories back to more normal levels. They're better than they were or higher than they were back in Q1, but still not above historic levels and we continue to be hand to mouth on several grades, both in the US and in Europe. They are improving. One other comment about an inventory is that in the U.S in particular, we're not positioned to do a lot of exports. That will require another level of inventory, which we don't have today. So if the inventory situation is improving, not back to historic levels on July contract discussions are still ongoing. Markets are very firm tight. We still have hurricane season in front of us. We have a heavy maintenance schedule in the industry in Q3 and early Q4 in the US. So contract discussions are ongoing and there are more announcements out there for August. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. I'm curious as to how much visibility do you have about inventory levels at your customers and whether, their inventory levels are back to normal or still low or maybe they're starting to run them down. Just curious on that and is there anything structural that precludes your US customers from looking to the international market to fulfil their demand? Is there something that precludes them from really doing that whether it's product quality or the type of material they need from converters, anything that you can comment on that? Bhavesh Patel : Sure. Steve, good morning. First of all, inventory at customers, it's difficult for us to have exact numbers on that, but I can tell you that when we've had some intermittent unplanned outages recently, we they seem to not have much inventory because before if they're too late, they're very concerned. So anecdotally, I would say there's not much inventory downstream, especially because there's this anticipation of pricing leveling off as well and we've been talking about that for months now and prices continue to rise because of the persistent demand strength. So, all of that says to me customers are not holding an extraordinary amount of inventory when we're late they call us right away. Secondly, your question about imports, historically, and even today imports because of long lead times and generally only the more generic grades are available for import. The imports tend to be limited. Furthermore if you think about today, transportation costs, shipping costs and container costs from Asia to the US basically wipe out the entire arbitrage that exists today in polyethylene price. For example, shipping cost, including container cost is three to four X, what it used to be pre pandemic. So all of that limits the amount of imports that really come in and the customer's ability to import product. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Hey, good morning, Bob. I hear your commentary about stronger for longer, but even if one takes a view that this tightness is temporary, maybe lasts for six months to a year ,the free cash flow you will get is real. You almost get $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow during this period of tightness. What would you do with that free cash flow? Would you either go towards sort of green projects like CCS or CO2 recycling or hydrogen projects, or B, would you rather go into M&A opportunity? There are a lot of midcap companies in chemical industry that would fit well with your IMD or APS segments. How do you think about allocating this extra free cash flow? Bhavesh Patel : Excellent. Thank you for that question, PJ. There's a lot there. First of all, you're actually right. There's this debate of where we are in the cycle and whether we're at elevated levels or not. I think there's a couple of points to be made. One is that what's lost in this debate is that LyondellBasell's mid cycle earnings have stepped up. Through the cycle earnings power is up by a $1 billion to $1.1 billion so far in 2021 compared to 2017. And when we have a full year of PO/TBA production in \u201823, that'll add another $400 million to $500 million of it's EBITDA to our earnings power. I think that's very important in terms of through the cycle cash generation ability to pay dividend, fund buybacks in the future all of that. We must not forget that while we continue to debate, are we at peak or not? Secondly, in terms of capital allocation, our first priority is to continue to pay down debt. And Michael talked about that in the prepared remarks about our targets of up to $4 billion of debt reduction this year. We think that's very achievable. We'll continue to update everyone on that. Once we're to that point where we've taken out $4 billion of debt, then I think the whole range of sort of alternatives come into play, continue to strengthen the dividend, think about buybacks, look for deep value, M&A. I think we've demonstrated that that's our focus and stay within the lanes where we swim today. So we'll continue to look for that. In terms of green projects, we're still studying where we can get the most bang for the buck, if you will and I suspect that our CapEx will reflect some of those green investments later in the decade, probably 2025 onwards and I would suspect that will be for a total in the second half of 2021, somewhere in $2 billion to $3 billion range in terms of CapEx in the second half of the decade, not annually, but total for the second half of the decade. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thank you. Good morning. Bhav you've mentioned that the freight rates crowd out in force in the US market. I assume those freight rates are a friction point on exports. So you had mentioned that maybe there could be more demand than we've seen and I presume part of that would be into the export markets. So how do you think it all plays out? I was looking this morning, it looks like export prices are now $0.15, $0.20 less than domestic prices for well molding polyethylene. So you have to give in on price in order to move that volume as inventories rebuild due to maybe offshore prices have to come up towards US prices. How do yoU.See that dynamic playing out? Bhavesh Patel : Yeah. Great question, Bob. So first of all, historically, even pre-pandemic freight rates coming from Asia to the US were always higher than flag rates going out of US to Asia because of the backhaul sort of concept on product going out. Typically we would pay about $40 per ton excluding packaging, just freight to get polyethylene for example, from the Gulf Coast to the Asia. Today, that's probably double. It's not really limited in terms of exports. Frankly, we just don't have enough production today to be able to export spot volume to Asia. We are doing some exports that are more contract oriented down to Latin America. We have some contract commitments, even in Asia that we continue to fulfil, but we're not quite back in that mode. Certainly as a company, we're not a where we're looking for spot volume going to Asia. And I think as, as the year progresses and some of these bottlenecks around shipping relieve themselves, I don't see that as being a challenge and over time as that happens, I think the price in China should start to come up as their ability to export finished goods improves. And I think the world will kind of equilibrate with China prices coming up as these shipping constraints relieve themselves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. Nice quarter guys. When I think about your profitability heading into the second half of the year, given I think your outlook tends to be little bit more positive than the consultants. Do you think your margins will continue to improve sequentially? Bhavesh Patel : Yeah. Good morning, Mike. So first of all, with all due respect to all of the prognosticators they've underestimated demand consistently over the last year and my comment about demand being stronger for longer, and I think that's really played out. And we've been talking about that since the last earnings call. I think that'll continue. If you think about it, we still have global reopening in front of us. So many durable goods that are on back order automobiles, appliances furniture I could go on and on many value chains are still very low on inventory, down through finished goods. So that needs to get rebuilt. And then for us as a company will benefit as mobility increases. So, when you think about all those factors, it's hard to imagine that demand would weaken in the second half of the year. Now we do have some other forces at play. We have feed stocks with coming up with it, with natural gas in the US coming up. Frac spreads haven't really opened up, but feedstocks are coming up but my sense is in this kind of market environment, there's some ability to pass some of that through. As a company, we have some planned and unplanned outages here in Q3? So, we don't guide on earnings, but if I think about Q3 versus Q2, we should have another very strong quarter in Q3. Remains to be seen if we can get to a record level like we did in Q2, but certainly very strong and well above prior records, that's how yoU.Should think about Q3 and in Q4, we'll have some seasonality, but still from a historic perspective, Q4 will be well above historic Q4 levels. So, hope that helps you in thinking through second half earnings for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning, Bhav, I was wondering if you could update us on your outlook for the propylene chain and specifically speak to polypropylene inventories. I think you mentioned a few times that you're seeing a substantial order backlog for durable goods. Looks like PP producers ran pretty hard in the quarter. How do yoU.See inventories on that chain and what implications do yoU.See for polypropylene prices versus monomer as we move forward through the back half of the year? Bhavesh Patel : All right, thanks, Kevin. So I see continued strength and I think as durables strengthen and especially auto because, that is one of the larger end uses for polypropylene. For us inventories are still low and they're actually tighter on polypropylene than they are on polyethylene. We're kind of hand to mouth and we've had the lightning strike at Lake Charles, which set us back about a week or a week or two and so we're very tight on polypropylene and for the most part, we're managing to contract minimums with our customers. As some of these bottlenecks relieve themselves for auto production, that's just going to make the market tighter and then appliances, those are big draws on polypropylene. So, my outlook is that polypropylene is going to be tight through the rest of the year and by the way, the other benefit that we're waiting to see is in APS segment with the auto sector being sluggish because of the chip shortage. We're not seeing the full earnings power of APS just yet and that's a very significant part of the APS segment our service of the automotive market. So I think polypropylene is going to be very strong. I think propylene is going to be a persistently high for the foreseeable future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Yes, good morning. And let me offer my condolences as well. Looking at the business I was struck by the comment that your August order book on polyethylene is the best that it's been in any other months of the year. How anomalous is that? And do you have people on 100% order allocation? How are you dealing with it? As I think about your volumes, the second quarter polyethylene volumes were basically flat with the first quarter, what are your thoughts on the third quarter polyethylene volumes? If you could dig into that a little bit, that'd be helpful. Bhavesh Patel : Sure. Frank, and thank you for your words of support. On the August order book comment, I think it's just an indication of us having more volume to sell. We've been constrained all year and, and as we try to inch our inventory back to more normal levels, we can with confidence take on more orders. We're still constrained. So we're not selling polyethylene unconstrained across the system, but there are some grades now where we have enough availability that if a customer wants product, we're able to do it, but it's really great by grades. In some areas we're still a contract minimums. And so, bottom line is Q3 US polyolefin's sales should be higher than Q2 as we produce more and sell more and I hope that that trend continues. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from our Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the results. I just wanted to get your thoughts a little bit more on I&D. Looks like you had a pretty strong performance there. How would you kind of judge the asset sales chain as well as propylene oxide over the next, say two to four quarters? Yeah, thanks. Bhavesh Patel : So on this propylene oxide demand is extremely strong. Margins are very, very strong there. We could sell more if we had it frankly. I expect that to continue again, coming back to my earlier comments about furniture shortages that play right into PO also automotive because the seat cushions and all that come from euro . So we see a really good runway for propylene oxide going into the second half of the year and into even next year. Frankly, if the rate command is growing when our plant starts up, we have a decent chance at absorbing a good bit of it right away. And I think it will come on when it's needed. Likewise, an asset  continued strength from housing, yoU.See the paint market being very strong because of home improvement and people buying houses and refurbishing them and so on. So I don't see a letup on either of those. Adding to that Arun, our Oxyfuels business has recovered nicely as we see more mobility around the world and still Europe is in largely in lockdown and I think the best profitability in Oxyfuels is still in front of us and I think that'll help offset any moderation in the O&P area as we see the fuels improving and in Q3, Q4 and into next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks and good morning. Bhav, wondering if you could give us an update on the molecular recycling initiatives in the Italy plant. Bhavesh Patel : Sure. Vince. It's coming along very well. We're about to commission a semi works plant here in September. And that'll be the next stage of development of that technology, where we continue to be very encouraged by the results we've seen at the bench scale. And we'll know within a couple of months what the bottlenecks are in that technology and my hope is that later in '22 and into '23, we're prepared to make an investment decision on a medium scale molecular recycling plant, which could be in production in '25 plus or minus. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Olympic Global. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, Hassan Ahmed : Bhav, wanted to revisit some of your comments about the I&D segment. Obviously, similar to most businesses, 2020 was a bit rough, but, nice bump up, back to correlate the runway to $600 million in EBITDA. And historically you've talked about the I&D segment being a pretty steady and as I sort of sit there and think about that and the steadiness of the earnings trajectory and some of the comments you made from the sounds of it, it seems that maybe, the earnings on a quarterly basis is maybe even north of $700 million on a steady eddie. So call it almost $3 billion and steady eddie EBITDA and from that from that segment. Is that the right way to think about it? Bhavesh Patel : Well, one thing that we didn't experience in the past was a complete shutdown of global economy and that caused more volatility in I&D because of the Oxy fuels. Typically it's been very stable. I think today with the assets we have, yoU.Should still think about I&D as a $1.5 billion plus or minus 15%. And then as we add to PO TBA project, we should be able to be consistently above $2 billion in I&D with upside when markets are strong, like they are today and that's how yoU.Should think about earnings power. $1.5, maybe, plus to $1.7 in that range plus or minus and then after the PO TBA project mid cycle consistently above $2 billion and in periods like this well, well above, Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Thank David Begleiter : Bhav. Just on refinery, do you think it can still be breakeven in Q3. And give me a comment about, be potentially profitable in Q4. How do you think about that business in 2022? Thank you. Bhavesh Patel : Thanks David. So on the refinery, I think we need a reset and rens frankly that would help a lot to get to breakeven. And as mobility increases, I think we have a good shot of Q4 being in the black. It really depends on how this variant plays out there. As you think about our company that most parts of the company have shown very good resilience through the pandemic. In fact, strengths in areas like packaging the refinery has been challenged not only from a demand standpoint, but the light heavy differential narrowing. I think we can get too close to break even here in Q3. We need a rens reset and in Q4, certainly we should be in the black. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question John Roberts : Income from equity investments, doubled sequentially from the first quarter. What's the EBITDA equivalent of that $285 million in equity income and maybe you could unpack for us a little bit, the sequential improvement between Sasol Bora and POJ please? Bhavesh Patel : Well, there's a lot there, and I'll probably ask you to follow up with Dave afterwards on some of the details. But let me just talk about a couple of the JVs. So first of all, our Saudi JVs remembered that the cracker is an ethane cracker and that's a big driver and as oil price rises and as prices go up globally on polyethylene that JV tends to do very well. That's a big contributor to the increase in earnings from the existing JVs and then the Sasol JV has done extremely well with the merchant ethylene that we sell from that JB and the ethane to polyethylene cash margins being where they are today. Between operating cash flow and the expected tax refund on that investment, we expect to recover our get back up half of our investment in 2021. So that's been a big driver and then incrementally all the other JVs has contributed to the improvement, but I would say the Saudi JVs and the Sasol JV were probably the largest contributor in the increase and the Sasol JV being brand new that was not in our P&L for most of last year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jaideep Pandya with On Field Research. Please proceed with your question. Jaideep Pandya : Just a question really, around your volumes in Q2, what was sort of constraining you because if I look at polyethylene polypropylene, both in the U.S and Europe  volume in the quarter and then just a little bit more longer term question when we think about your businesses, which are your businesses, which you think have sort of room to grow in spreads as well as volumes as the economy reopens in 2022 and 2023 and, people drive more, fly more, etcetera. Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : So Jaideep, first of all on volume constraints in Q2, remember we still had some pleas impacts early in Q2 here in the US and then, we've had some unplanned downtime in the polymers. But sequentially, we were able to build a bit of inventory and believe we, we had pretty good production. So I think the headline there's a lot underneath the details in which product lines were higher or lower. My sense is that the fuels part of the business was still a bit weak in Q2, but the polymers and the PO was very strong in production in Q2. And certainly up compared to Q1 going forward, you asked about which product lines have the most potential for spread and volume improvement indefinitely it's in fuels. I do think there's incremental potential in spread improvement and in, in the polymers area globally, but where I think we have the greatest opportunity for a step up in volume and, and spread is in Oxyfuels and in gasoline and distillate here in the U.S and then we hope that will be very meaningful as we work through Q3 and certainly into Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Company. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Good Morning, Bava. Sorry to hear about the accident. I had a question on the renewable side, so you have several initiatives on the table. I think it's probably fair to say that Lyondell is one of the leaders in this area, but at the same time, investors have a hard time gauging just how meaningful these projects might be for such a large company. So could you help put that into perspective as you look at like CCP or more tech or circulation what are you most excited about and, and what is the potential to really move the needle for you? Bhavesh Patel : Sure.Thank you, Matthew. And I appreciate your words of support. Yeah, I mean, that's I have these conversations with investors often and that this is going to build momentum over the decade. First of all, we called that our goal is to have about -- about 2 million tons of recycled or renewable based plastics by the end of the decade, by, by 2030, we think that'll probably represent about 15% of our production. I mean, think about our work on MarTech, as well, as on circularity on QCP mechanical recycling and the circulum brand in particular, that's all part of our polyolefin franchise and given our, our capabilities in research and development application development we're leading in this area in circularity and we'll continue to it's just part of the polyolefin businesses, how I was thinking about it. Not, not some separate significant step up in earnings, but it's part of making the polyolefin business work. Long- Term Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Jonathan Elvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Elvers : Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Really appreciate the focus on de-leveraging and the very good progress you've made there year-to-date. And I guess, as it relates to the $4 billion net debt reduction target that you've referenced is a net target. I'm curious, kind of how you think about paying down for debt versus just building cash on the balance sheet and in the case of the former possibly where within the debt capital structure you think about targeting? Thanks. Bhavesh Patel : Yeah. I'll ask Michael to respond to that question. Michael McMurray : Sure. Great. So, so great question, may be just a couple of points. What I, what I would say is that our overall maturity profile is in great shape, especially after all the actions that we took in 2020. Actually our weighted average maturity is about 16 years as we sit here today and we don't have any significant near-term maturities on a, on a year-to-day basis we've taken out $8 billion that was done through our term loan and some of our 2023. We have the ability to further de-leverage in the second half of the year with the $650 million of callable notes that we have as well. So that's -- that's obviously something that is in a prime focus. And then lastly we typically have a bit of commercial paper that's outstanding that we can, that we can use to deliver. And then we're contemplating potentially doing a tender as well again in the second half of the year. And then just from a from a targeting point of view kind of through the cycle our total debt to EBITDA target is about one and a half to two and a half times. And so quite frankly, as we're progressing through this year, we're in, we're in great shape from that perspective, as well as evidenced by the upgrade that we received a week a week ago from S&P. Jonathan Elvers : Great, thank you, Michael and Jonathan let's see how the year progresses when we get this $4 billion put away. Let's let's continue the dialogue on capital allocation. I think we've proven over the years that we've been very disciplined in this area, and you should continue to expect that from us. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Bhavesh Patel for closing remarks. Bhavesh Patel : All right. Thank you, Alex. In Q2 2021, LyondellBasell has demonstrated its turbocharged earnings power in a very strong market environment and a larger company going forward. We expect demand to remain strong is as mentioned throughout this call with reopening still ahead of us in many parts of the world backlogs and many product areas that has to be relieved, inventory restocking and increase mobility. We had lined Elvis LR really well positioned to significantly strengthen our investment grade balance sheet, pay down debt and to capitalize on a stronger for longer market environment. The main points that I hope investors got out of the call today is that we've whether where we can debate about where we are in the cycle. LyondellBasell have increased our earnings power through the cycle by more than $1 billion to date compared to 2017. And after our PO/TBA project is online, we'll add another $500 million of EBITDA in earnings power. All of that should provide for very robust cash flow, which will deploy in a very disciplined way to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you for your interest and hope you all have a great weekend. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. I'd now turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, Operator. Hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's Third Quarter 2021 Teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call, and is available on our website at www. lyondellbasell.com. Investor relations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that can lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and a regulatory filings, which are also available at our Investor website.  Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with other disclosures, including the earnings release. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 PM Eastern Time today until November 30th by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the During today's call, we will focus on Third Quarter results. The current environment, our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we've discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last-in, first-out or LIFO accounting, and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the Third Quarter of 2020, we recognized a non-cash impairment of $582 million that reflected our expectation for reduced profitability from our Houston Refinery States.  Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. But that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thank you, Dave. I'm pleased to join for my 28th and last earnings call as CEO of LyondellBasell. Per our usual practice, we will review our results from the quarter. As I prepare to leave the Company at the end of the year, I have taken some time to reflect on the strong Company we have built, and our outlook for the future. Without a doubt, LyondellBasell's future is very bright. Because of the efforts of our incredibly talented and hardworking global team, we've built a Company that has proven it can perform under a range of conditions. During an event like a global pandemic that no one could have predicted or imagined, we were able to fund our dividend with cash from operations and grow our Company through accretive M&A.  I'm confident that LyondellBasell will continue to deliver for its stakeholders in the future. This is a Company that is focused on building value for the long term, and one that is built to stand the test of time. With that said, let's review our third quarter results. Please turn to slide three. LyondellBasell 's businesses are continuing to benefit from robust global demand and tight market conditions. In the third quarter, our Company delivered $5.25 per share of earnings, more than four times higher than the same quarter last year. EBITDA was approximately $2.7 billion, a year-over-year quarterly improvement of $1.8 billion.  Efficient cash conversion generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, a new quarterly record for our Company. These results are indicative of strong markets. The discipline with which we approached running our business, and the increased earnings power from our value-driven investments and accretive growth over the past several years. We remain focused on improving LyondellBasell's cash generation through all stages of the business cycle. Please turn to Slide 4 to review our quarterly profitability. While our portfolio delivered to $2.7 billion of EBITDA, this quarter's results reflect a sequential decline of 11%. Increased costs for natural gas, ethane, NAPFA, and butane compressed margins for many products from the high seen in the second quarter.  This, however, does not change how we see the future. We continue to see very solid demand for our products and remain highly constructive on the outlook for our businesses as global reopening continues to play out over the coming quarters. We expect the combination of a well-funded economy and pent-up consumer demand for durable goods, as well as the non-durable goods associated with travel, leisure, and other in-person activities will continue to [Indiscernible] attractive markets. In short, we remain confident that a reopening global economy, and eventual normalization of global supply chains will support continued growth for our businesses over the coming quarters. Let's turn to slide 5 and review our safety performance. Our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors, rose to 0.24 during the third quarter. Much of this increase is associated with the tragic incident in our asset deals facility in La Porte, Texas during July. We remain committed to learning from this incident, and incorporating the learning's from the investigations to help prevent such tragedies from ever happening again. Looking more closely at the chart, we are encouraged by the notable improvement in chemical industry safety performance during 2020. We are watching to see if this is a durable trend or perhaps a one-time benefit from reduced in-person work hours during the high for depend pandemic.  At LyondellBasell, continuous learning and self-improving culture, our key focus areas in our pursuit of goal zero, safety performance for both our employees and our contractors. On slide six, I would like to highlight LyondellBasell 's increased commitments to help address the global challenge of climate change. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and a goal to achieve net zero, scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our growth -- global operations by 2015. We now aim to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. We plan to achieve these goals by a dancing progress on several fronts. First, we are improving energy efficiency in all our plants and reducing our need for high carbon content fuel sources, such as coal. We are already moving on this front. In September, we announced our plan to phase out coal from the power plant at our site investment in Germany. Second, we intend to procure at least 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Third, we are focusing on minimizing flare emissions from our clients, particularly during shutdowns and startup events. In addition, we're evaluating a portfolio of technology options across the Company's manufacturing footprint, including sustainable hydrogen, increased electrification, and carbon capture for storage, for re-utilization in our processes. We believe this strategy puts us on an achievable pathway toward our net zero goal. In the near-term, we do not expect significant increases in our overall capital budget, as reduced spending associated with the completion of our POTBA (ph) project in 2022 will be offset by an increasing share of climate-related investment. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael Mc Murray : Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to share my sincere gratitude to Bob for his tireless work, inspirational energy, and thought partnership in leading and growing LyondellBasell for nearly 12 years. We're all sad to see you go Bob, but we will be eagerly watching your progress and wishing you continued success. Please turn to Slide 7 and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash-generation, which has been bolstered by our recent growth investments. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated a record $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the $5.4 billion of cash generated over the last 12 months.  Our pre - operating cash flow for the third quarter improved by more than 10% relative to the second quarter, and our pre -operating cash flow yield was 15% over the last 12 months. We expect this chart will continue to improve during the fourth quarter as 2020 results drop-off from our trailing performance. Let's turn to slide 8 and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the third quarter. As I've mentioned during previous calls, we are highly focused on shareholder returns. A strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In addition to our dividend, we also resumed share repurchases during the third quarter and reduced our share count by approximately $1 million.  We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $500 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flows supported debt reduction of nearly $700 million, bringing our year-to-date debt reduction to $2.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.9 billion. In July, S&P Global Ratings recognized the improvement in our balance sheet by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. During the fourth quarter, we expect that robust cash-generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce debt by up to $4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $650 million of bonds in late October.  We do not foresee the need for additional debt repayment in 2022. Confidence around our deleveraging targets enabled us to resume share repurchases in September, and we continued to opportunistically repurchase shares during October. As of October 22nd, we have repurchased a total of 1.6 million shares. Now, I would like to highlight the results for each of our segments on slide nine in the third quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $2.7 billion. Our results reflect strong margins, supported by robust demand for our products and tight market conditions. Offset by higher cost primarily our OMP Europe, Asia, international segment and our I&D segment. Let's begin the individual segment discussions on slide 10 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefin 's America's segment. Robust demand drove EBITDA to about $1.6 billion, slightly lower than the Second Quarter. Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million compared to the Second Quarter due to lower margins and volumes. Despite relatively stable benchmark ethylene margins. Our margins declined, as we purchased ethylene supplement production, and meet strong derivative demand. Volumes decreased due to unplanned maintenance, resulting in a cracker operating rate of 89%. Polyolefins results increased more than $75 million during the Third Quarter as robust demand and tight markets drove spreads higher with Polyolefin prices increasing slightly more than monomer prices. In fact, our polypropylene spreads reached a historic high. We continue to see strong demand for our products as we begin the fourth-quarter.  However, higher energy and feedstock costs, along with typical seasonality demand softness toward the end of the year, are likely to compress margins for our O&P America businesses. Now, please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefin in Europe, Asia, International segment. Higher feedstock costs and lower seasonal demand during summer holidays, reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets ph., resulting in a third quarter EBITDA of $474 million, $234 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins results declined about $50 million as margins decreased, driven by higher feedstock costs despite the higher ethylene and co-product prices. We operated our crackers at a rate of 92% of capacity due to planned maintenance.  Combined Polyolefin results decreased approximately a $120 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal band drove declines in Polyolefin price spreads relative to monitor costs and reduced volumes. Declining Polyolefin spread also affected our joint venture equity income by about $35 million. During the fourth quarter, we expect to see further margin declines from higher energy and feedstock costs along with end-of-year seasonality.  Our ethylene volumes are expected to decline due to planned maintenance. Please turn to Slide 12 as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. Rising feedstock and energy costs drove margin declines in most businesses resulted in third quarter EBITDA of $348 million, $248 million lower than the prior quarter. Results were impacted by approximately $25 billion due to site closure costs associated with the exit of our ethanol business. Third quarter propylene oxide and derivative results decreased about $15 million, as margins declined slightly from the historical highs of the second quarter. Durable goods demand remained strong. Resulting in increased volumes.  Intermediate chemicals results decreased approximately $140 million. Margins declined in most businesses, primarily serene, and volumes decreased as a result of downtime in our acetyl business. Oxyfuels and related products results decreased about $40 million as increased butane feedstock prices more than offset the increased volume from improved gasoline demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect volumes to increase with the restart of our LaPorte Acetyl Facility and continued strength in demand for durable goods. Margins are likely to moderate with fourth-quarter seasonality and higher raw material costs for I&D segment.  Now, let's move forward and review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment on Slide 13. Customer supply chain constraints continue to hinged results with third quarter EBITDA of $121 million, $8 million lower than the second quarter. Compounding and solution results were relatively unchanged. Margins were higher, but partially offset by a decrease in volume due to restricted production and downstream markets including the automotive sector, appliance manufacturing, and other industries affected by semiconductor shortages. Advanced polymer results decreased about $10 million driven by lower margins and volumes, primarily due to plant maintenance.  We expect results will be similar in the fourth quarter as it will likely take several quarters before supply chain constraints begin to improve. Now, let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the result of our refining segment. Margins improved significantly in the third quarter, resulting in an EBITDA improvement of a $122 million to a positive $41 million. In the third quarter, prices for by-products increased costs for renewable identification number credits or RINs decreased and the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark in increased by $1.65 per barrel to $23.11 per barrel.  The average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 260 thousand barrels per day, and operating rates of 97%. Improved demand from increasing mobility should be supportive for our refining margins and could enable continued profitability during the Fourth Quarter. Let's finish the segment discussion on slide 15 with the result of our technology segment. Increased licensing revenue drove Third Quarter EBITDA to a record $155 million, $63million higher than the prior quarter. We expect the Fourth Quarter profitability for a technology business will return to similar quarterly levels As the first half of this year, based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue, and catalyst demand. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob. Bob Patel : Thank you, Michael. Please turn to slide 16 for a summary of the value-driven growth initiatives that our Company has developed since 2018. Our approach is to pursue prudent and accretive investments that chart a clear path for increasing EBITDA. In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and forming the advanced polymer solutions segment from both legacy and acquired businesses. With the integration complete, we have a solid platform for future growth and synergies should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the market served by this segment. In the second quarter of 2020, we started at 500,000 ton per year polypropylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation hyper zone HDP technology.  At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this acetyl is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA. In September of 2020, we established a new integrated cracker joint venture in Northeastern China. This investment is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our Company, again, based upon full capacity and historical industry margins. In December of 2020, we closed the transaction for the integrated polyethylene joint venture in the Louisiana. At full capacity in historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA for our Company. In our intermediate and derivatives segment, the combination of two new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023, put together at almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. Taken together, we estimate these initiatives could add up to $1.5 billion of EBITDA to our mid-cycle earnings. Slide 17 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell's profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our Company.  Over the period from 2011 to 2019,we delivered a little over an average of $6.5 billion of EBITDA, excluding LCM and impairment. In fact, we reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our Company. And today's strong market and with many of our growth initiatives providing strong contributions, our last 12 months performance was $8.6 billion exceeding our previous record, and reaching nearly 30% above the historical average.  While no two cycles are exactly alike, our performance during prior business cycles provides valuable context on how these growth initiatives might perform and reposition LyondellBasell during the next cycle with a larger asset base. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our business with slide 18. In the near to mid-term, further progress with vaccination roll outs should continue to support solid demand and margin for our products. With 7 billion doses of vaccines administered worldwide, approximately 1/2 of the world's population has now received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine.  New cases in the U.S. have fallen to less than half the level seen during the delta-driven spike of August and September. We're keeping a watchful eye on rising case rates in the UK and parts of Europe, but most virus indicators are trending in a favorable direction. Over the coming months, margins are expected to face headwinds from typical fourth quarter seasonality combined with increasing feedstock and energy prices. We anticipate some margin compression, but expect markets to remain relatively strong. Logistics constraints and the pace of vaccination are currently hindering demand. Eventually, consumers will have more options when purchasing a new car.  [Indiscernible] furniture will become available. And all of us will find a way to resume traveling, whether for business or leisure. Pent-up demand is tangible, and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods. Monetary stimulus may taper, but the unprecedented levels of stimulus deployed during the pandemic will have lasting effects that are typically supported for commodities. Let me close with Slide 19. As I think about the coming weeks and prepare to pass the baton to the next leader of LyondellBasell, I draw comfort from the knowledge that the broader team we have in place is incredibly talented and has created great momentum that will endure for many years.  In the end, our assets don't run themselves and decisions don't get made by spreadsheets. I'm confident that this remarkable team will continue to take our Company to greater heights. Our Company has never forgotten our core values built upon safety, reliability, and cost efficiency. These attributes form the basis for leading an advantage positions in our industry. With these strong foundations in place, we are deploying our business model across a larger asset base with embedded growth through projects such as our PO/TBA facility and further expansion of our global between measures of our partnerships.  Contending with our investment to reduce carbon emissions, we're also building innovative business models that will increase our utilization of plastic waste as a circular feedstock. My belief is that over the next decade, LyondellBasell will become a global market leader, in the exciting and rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. With strong markets and new sources of EBITDA, our team works diligently to maximize cash conversion. and we have taken care to reinvest that hard earned cash into accretive investments that add value, and drive future growth. All of this work is underpinned by a disciplined financial strategy.  We stand by our dual commitments to a growing dividend and an investment-grade credit rating through cycles. We are confident that we can complete our deleveraging and achieve our target of reducing debt by $4 billion before the end of this year with strong cash flows and no need for further debt reduction, we expect to continue reinvesting in our Company through the opportunistic repurchase of LyondellBasell 's shares. I hope you share my sincere enthusiasm about the future of our Company. We are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to as a question, [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit your questions to one to allow time for everyone. Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas (ph) with JPMorgan, please proceed with your question. Jonathan Elvers : Thanks very much. Bob, what do you think that the skill set of the new CEO of Lyondell should be? That is, what should he understand? What should his particular strength [Indiscernible] Bob Patel : Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Good morning. Well, I think to be successful in the business that we compete in, having your firm from view about the importance of safety, reliability, and cost efficiency, it's what we did in the early days when we came out of the Chapter 11 process. And that will be important. And I recall as I, 7 years ago, roughly was named the CEO here. I talked about the importance of strategy and culture. And so, my sense is if I were to think about the next chapter, the things that I would add would be focus on circularity and our sustainability initiatives. And I think the uniqueness of our culture is that the next CEO who's grounded, rigorous, and works in service of the employees and the shareholders will be successful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. And good morning, everyone and thanks, Bob, and good luck on going forward. If I could just ask you, it's obviously been an unusual year with the weather and the outages, and the ship issue. If you could help us think about utilization rates for your assets in 2022, assuming no unplanned activity. When do you think you'll see polypropylene rates get back over 90% in the U.S.? I noticed polypropylene in the EAI had very high volume in the third quarter, is that a function of less demand for compounding PPs because of autos? But just how should we think about PP utilization rates in U.S. and Europe for next year? Bob Patel : Sure. Thank you, Vincent. First of all, I will just mentioned a couple of words about Q3 and kind of the likeness we had. We had a couple of very a typical unplanned outages that were quite large. First, we had the asset deals unplanned downtime due to the incident we had. At Q3 volumes and margins or -- the volume lost in the Q3 margins, that outage impacted earnings by about $75 million. We also had a couple of larger, atypical events in O&P America 's at Q3 margins that lost volume impacted earnings by about 200 million. So we could take three or four incidents, and those outages reduced Q3 by about 275 million.  There were other normal unplanned outages that we have in any given quarter, but yes it was quite an unusual quarter in that regards. As I think about next year, you said it well, I mean, I think there's still a lot of constraints in terms of demand today. We still see a global supply chain that is not operating as smoothly as what we've seen in the past. Chip shortages, shipping restrict constraints, whether it's high cost for containers or just the ships being in the wrong place.  I think -- I believe firmly that that has impacted exports of finished goods out of China, which has in turn reduced demand for plastics in China. As we look in next year, I would expect that by the middle of the year, lot of these issues should have normalized, and we should see more typical global trade patterns. And with stronger durable goods market, especially for auto and appliances, those things that people have not had available to purchase that should favor polypropylene, probably more differentially than polyethylene. So I think by mid next year we should see operating rates sustained at over 90% and a lot of these constraints will have relieve themselves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Bob, I'd echo many of the comments Michael made in his prepared remarks about you and wish you all the best of luck in the future. My question for this morning is on the refinery, better operational results there in the quarter, but 6 or 7 weeks ago, I think you also announced the intent to revisit strategic options there. And so just wondering if you could comment on both of those, the near-term operational outlook, as well as the options on the strategic menu, and progress on that front lately. Bob Patel : Thank you Kevin, for your kind words. So first on the business side, on the refinery, things are certainly turned positive. We turned a profit in Q3, as we mentioned during the prepared remarks. Q4 looks to be stronger than Q3. Of late what we're seeing with high oil prices, we're seeing more Canadian sour crude coming down to the U.S. which is causing the light heavy differential to widen. That favors our refinery and I think that trend could continue for the next quarter at least. On the product side, distillate inventories are very low. Distillate cracks have expanded. We're seeing air travel get back to about 80% of pre - COVID levels in the U.S. Miles driven are back to pre - COVID levels now. So all of the trends when you think about demand, like heavy differential, all indicate improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And so we're pleased to be back in the black and refining. With regards to the process and the transaction, we're working through the process now and our aim is to move towards a transaction in the coming quarter or 2. We still continue to believe that the best value for this -- that this refinery can create is by being part of the system where it can be optimized from crude purchasing to logistics to the co-product processing. We think that a 270 thousand barrel a day refinery on the Houston ship channel is well-placed and create tones of value as part of a system. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. Good morning guys. And quick question for you, Bob. I mean, when you look over the next 12 to 24 months, clearly your expectation is for margins to moderate. You're not expecting a margin cliff like some more various participants out there. But the question is 1. Where can you be wrong? And 2. What are the market dynamics that you believe should prevent like a worst-case scenario? Bob Patel : Yes. Great question, Edlain. I mean, this has been the debate for the last 12/15 months. And many of you will recall that I talked about demand being stronger for longer. I still believe that. I think when -- as you go quarter after quarter, all of the market forecasters have underestimated demand growth. And I think that will continue to play out. I mean, think about it. We still have reopening ahead of us. There's a lot of buying power in the hands of consumers. Highest historic savings rates in the U.S. and in many other regions around the world. They have still accommodative central bank policies. Even if tapering starts, still have very low Interest rate environment here and abroad.  And so much pent-up demand from goods and services that we couldn't access because the shortages or because of limitations on travel. So I think this sort of scenario of moderating margins is based on continued strong demand and strengthening as reopening really takes hold. And some of these supply chain constraints relieved themselves like the chip shortages. And you think about the impact in our compounding business fault because auto production is low, it's significant.  When those chips are available, we think that our polypropylene business, RPO business and our compounding business will benefit materially from more automotive production. You asked about what could go wrong, I think in the near term, we'll have to watch energy prices. There could be points where we could see potentially spikes in energy price. But I think sustained high energy prices are unlikely because at some point they will be met with more supply. So I think that's what we have to watch. And the other is, the picture in China remains a bit marquee, and I'll try to address that through the upcoming questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort (ph) with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Good morning, this is actually Mike here in for Bob. Probably, if I could just -- you started down the path that I wanted to ask about that as China's just considering all the dynamics around the energy controls and pass-through decarbonization effort. And what do you see a calendar future implications there for petrochemical? And perhaps just strategy for expansion in that region. Bob Patel : Yes. So I don't profess to have the exact picture of what could happen, but I'll give you a few of my thoughts about what could happen. In terms of dual controls in the near term, you do see some lowering of petrochemical production. I think ultimately that will require more imports, which benefits exporting regions like the U.S., whether it's in the I&D business or in the OMP business, I think that's a net positive. I think the reduction of coal use will likely turn off some of the CTO complexes requiring more imports of polyethylene and polypropylene, favorable for global producers like us.  The shipping constraints, I think have been a net negative in the near-term, as they've not been producing for exports as much of finished goods. Two reasons. 1. They can't get enough containers. 2. Because shipping costs in many cases are 10X when you consider both the sea freight plus the container costs. They're just not able to pass that kind of increase on.  I think as that normalizes, I would think that demand should increase in China as they're able to export more finished goods next year and I think the longer-term outlook is that as there's less coal consumption, it seems to me that the amount of expansion that could take place in China could be less than what we've seen in the past. Certainly, MTO and CTO based technology or based capacity will likely not be as robust as what we've seen in the last 10 years. So I think there are many bullish aspects to how this could play out. But I think it'll be choppy over the next couple of quarters until we get back to something more normal. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Olympic Global. Please proceed with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Morning, Bob and wishing you all the best. Bob, a question around near-term polyethylene dynamics. In the marketplace, it seems there are 2 camps now, you have the IHS guys talking about as much as $0.15 a pound and margin compression for polyethylene in Q4. And you have Dow that's talking about $0.07 to $0.08 a pound. So just trying to figure out which camp Lyondell 's in? Bob Patel : Yeah. So in terms of PD price moderation in price is kind of where we are and we have them for some time. If you look back over the last 10 years, most every year you see some moderation in Q4 in polyethylene price, and I Hassan Ahmed : think this year will be very similar. And at the same time, we do have feedstock costs that have come up some here in the U.S. by sensors on the feedstock side that ethane saves very abundant and available. And what setting the price for ethane is natural gas price. And it seems that natural gas prices kind of settled out here in the high 4, $5 per million Btu range. If that's our assumption. And of course we can have a spike here or there, but let's say we get through the winter in that range. And [Indiscernible] spreads are five to $0.07 a gallon for ethane. I think the cost side is kind of where Bob Patel : we are and there could be some moderation in margin. 15 feels heavy to me, I suspect that it will be something more modest than that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning, Bob. As well, again, all the best in your future endeavors. Bob, a one of your competitor s has recently announced plans to spend a billion dollars a year to decarbonize our asset base. How do you think about the Lyondell's efforts to de -carbonize their base -- your base, and how much it will cost going forward? Yes. Thank you, Dave. First, let me talk more broadly about our sustainability strategy and how we think about that. We've been very clear that we want to lead on circularity, and we want to be a fast follower when it comes to CO2. So what that means, because it on circular parity, we want to lean into innovation and developing technologies. Whereas on CO2 reduction, we're likely to -- we could co-develop with others, but we may also combine that with licensing in technology. So having said all of that, when you think about our capex, first of all, we've been consistent that we believe our capex will be about $2 billion for per year through 2025.  So the next 4 full years, we expect to be around $2 billion of capex. In the back half of the decade, as we look to implement technologies like electric furnaces or whatever comes about, we think the CapEx could step up by about 0.5 billion a year in the back half of the decade. So instead of 2 -- 2.5 per year, maybe starting in 26. But I don't expect that to be sooner than that. $1 billion per year in sustainability related CapEx, that's not part of our plans as we sit here today. David Kinney : And Dave, when you think about next year, we have CapEx rolling off from PO/TBA projects gets completed. So we do have room within the budget above that line there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Good morning. And Bob we'll miss you. Good luck in your next endeavor. Bob Patel : Thank you. P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Question on feedstock slate. As natural gas prices -- natural gas liquid prices, NGL prices are going up in the U.S., ethane, propane how did you change your feedstock slate in North America and what do you expect going forward? And similar question in Europe where [Indiscernible] spiked, but natural gas prices also spiked. So how did the European feedstock slate change? And what do you see there as well? Bob Patel : And thank you, P.J.. Let me talk a little bit of our broadly about energy prices as context, and then I'll get into the feedstock flexibility both here in Europe. First of all, as you look at kind of the outlook for oil prices, slightly that oil prices will persist -- will be persistently high over the next 2-3 years. We don't see large IOCs coming back to drill. The independents here are starting to drill more. But the very large companies who have presence in, for example, the Permian, we're not seeing drilling come back.  High oil prices are good for LyondellBasell. So I think over the long run, there will be plenty of ethane. I think ethane has -- there's more gas supply with more drilling. Ethane should be plentiful. Gas price should be kept in check, especially with feedstock flexibility, we'll have a chance to rotate to other feeds. In the near-term, we recently still find to be the favored feed. Propane and butane prices have run quite a lot. So they've been really out of the mix.  We have been cracking some gas oil and heavies as well. So think about like a barbell slate, light and heavy but in the middle, we've not been cracking in the U.S. in Europe, because of high LPG prices, we've been tracking that for our mainly and co-product values have been pretty good. I mean, VTR dying is run well. Propylene has come off some but still at very healthy levels. So overall, propane, butane, I would expect will be out of the mix for most of the winter. And we will focus on ethane, and the heavy end here in the U.S. and NAPFA in Europe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson (ph) with Mazuho, please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : Thank you very much. Can you sit on our current demand trends and intermediates, where do you sense chain inventories are? How do you see the setup for 2022 profitability evolving in the context of more normalized operates? And maybe just a quick update on Oxyfuels as well. Thank you so much. Bob Patel : Sure. Thank you, Chris. So first of all, on IND, PO continues to be very strong. propylene oxide demand is strong, the market continues to be tight. We will have a record year this year in our PO business. And we see that continuing as I mentioned earlier, in one of the prior questions, as auto demand comes back, appliance demand comes back because of constraints being relieved. We think that favors a continued strength in the PO business. And I actually think that our new capacity in '23 could come on at a time when the market desperately needs more PO. And I think it could be absorbed very quickly. So we're very constructive PO next year, Acetyl continues to be strong. Power plant is back up and running as of early October, we're back to running at full rates and we're enjoying the benefits of a very good market and we think that'll carry well into '22. On Oxyfuels, demand is back, but unfortunately, the challenge today is higher butane price. So butane as a percent of crude oil, is kind of grown 90%. And likely through the winter months, we won't get much relief on that. But next year as we get into the spring, and LPG prices moderate after we get through the winter season. And the demand should continue to improve and be better as driving improves in Europe and other parts of the world. I think Oxyfuels will get back to the typical contribution of 400 to 450 million annually prior to the new projects starting out. Styrene likely mixed. when there are outages, we see styrene get a bump when everyone runs. Styrene is either side of break even. And I think the real kind of gems in the portfolio next year will be propylene oxide, acetyls, and oxyfuels likely starting in the spring. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. So Bob, you made a comment that you want Lyondell to lead on circularity. And it's not a surprising comments coming from you given your leadership years ago and that aligns to plastic waste. are you -- is that an ethical issue or are you saying that because your customers are demanding it, you have these Circulon products. And my question for you is, do you have significant demand for those products now that you can't meet the supply? How long before you might have paralysis-based production or renewable feed stock-based production? How far away is this and is it meaningful? Bob Patel : Yes. Thank you Steve. First, I think there are two aspects to this. The first is the demand side, and the second is playing to our strengths. On the demand side, absolutely our customers are asking for more and more circular products and plastics each year. Which they demand that we can't meet, and that's driven by their own commitments to increase recycled content and packaging. So the entire value chain is pulling, starting with the range owners. They're pulling more circular products, and I think that will just grow as the years progress. Why I think we should read on circularity is that, we have a strong technology base in Polyolefin.  We have Polyolefins process technology, catalyst technology, also we're developing this Martec Technology, which is the Molecular Recycling. That pilot plant should be operational in the coming weeks. And I suspect by about March, April, we will know whether we have an investable technology. My sense is that we will, the question will be to what degree can we get the yields that we want Paralysis oil. Our current plan is by end of next year to be in a position to dedicate some of our capEx to building a Martec plant, either in the U.S. or in Europe. So I think it plays to our strengths and the demand fall was there from brand owners. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from John Roberts (ph) with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thanks and just in case we don't get another call with you Bob best wishes in the future. Bob Patel : Thank you John. John Roberts : Your licensing activity gets an early look into industry expansion activity. I assume that new license discussions declined during the pandemic, but have discussions for new plant licenses increased significantly coming out of the recession and any differences between polyethylene and polypropylene? Bob Patel : Sure. So John, we had a gap during the pandemic as you said, so I think probably something around 12, 15 months of much, much lower activity. It has picked up in Q3. More polypropylene than polyethylene and quite a bit of it in China. I think that's trend that we've seen. Having said that, pickup in demand or activity in Q3, we're still not quite back to 2019 levels. So I think still modest. And as you think about where you're going with this question, John is, what does it mean for supply 3, 4, 5 years out, I do think we're going to find a gap and new supply 3 years from now because those decisions to expand were delayed or paused during the pandemic.  And then if you look further out and you think about operating rates to more fully answer your question, beyond the couple of new projects that are coming in the U.S. and some pace of capacity in China, it seems to me that polyethylene and polypropylene operating rates likely reach some sort of a bottom in '22 or '23 and steadily increase. And that bottom is very shallow, if not maybe sideways from where we are today given our outlook on demand. So I think we do see operating rates increase as we move through into the middle of the decade. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question and I'll add my congrats and best wishes to you Bob, as well. Pleasure working with you. Just wanted to, I guess ask about polypropylene and the acetyl chain. So polypropylene, I guess was definitely impacted by the automotive shortages. Do you see that evolving to a better spot over the next 2 quarters? And then similarly with acetyl, was it mainly the downtime that held that business back in the quarter? And I guess maybe strident outlet there as well. Thanks. Bob Patel : Certainly, I'll start with acetyl. Definitely, the downtime is what impacted us in Q3. And as I mentioned at Q3 margins, that lost volume reduced our earnings by about $75 million. Backup and running full rates now. And outlook is very good for acetyls. And our view is that margin should be very healthy even going into next year. So we're quite positive about that business. On polypropylene, auto was weak for packaging was quite strong and we had a lot of kind of medical-related demands. So that help polypropylene up. Now as we see auto come back for our Company, we have much more leverage to the auto recovery.  Did you think about our polypropylene sales to OEMS or tier 2s plus what goes through compounding plus some of our polyethylene that goes into plastic fuel tanks. Our Company will benefit immensely from the chip shortage. Hopefully alleviating, as result to the next few quarters. And I think you'll see that in the EPS business, there should be a meaningful step-up. Once we see [Indiscernible] come back. And as a result of all of that, I think PP business will remain tight. It's frankly pretty tight today. And demand continues to be really strong. And Arun, in our third quarter was more production shortfall because we had 2 weeks of downtime in Charlesberg (ph) facilities here in the United States as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Hell of a run, Bob. Hell of a run. What are you most proud of during your tenure as CEO, and what do you think is the biggest piece of unfinished business that perhaps the next CEO auto addressed early on in his or her tenure? Bob Patel : Thank you, Frank. It's really been great working with all of you and getting to know all of you better. What I'm most proud of, well, been 12 years with the Company. I almost joined a very different Company back in March of 2010. And I'm proud of the employees who stuck through it, through Mitch thick and thin. There are many people here who stayed during the Chapter 11 process, and won their Company back. And I'm really proud to have been a part of -- going from where we were back in March 2010 to where we are today. In terms of what's ahead, I think it's really about continuing to capture value from all these growth projects that we've implemented.  We've invested around $9 billion in 5 or 6 discrete initiatives, both organic and inorganic. And it provides an incredible runway for earnings growth. So I think it's really just capture the value from the growth that we've been through, continue to lean into circularity. Focus on CO2 reduction and be value minded when it comes to M&A. Deep value like we have been and be okay with saying no when the deal doesn't make sense. So I think we've built an incredible cash machine here at LyondellBasell. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yeah, good morning. Two questions around Europe. So when you look at your business, one of your calling cards over the last decade was you guys going to lighter and more into LPG. At least in the near-term, that doesn't seem to be as beneficial. What's your view longer-term LPG versus NAPFA ratio? Where does that go?  What does it do to the competitiveness of your business within Europe? And then the second one is, if carbon prices are just structurally going to be higher in Europe, whether that's natural gas or LPG coming in, what does that do to the competitiveness of the European petrochemical business? And should we look to see meaningful reductions in production there, maybe over the next 5 years or so on the back of that? Bob Patel : Thanks, Duffy. Both really great questions. On the European LPG competitiveness. I think this will have inflow. We've seen periods when LPG became expensive in Europe. We've seen when butane is traded at 45% of crude price. So, I think that'll continue part of the lower prices scenario will be when U.S. exports of butane and propane increase. As there's more oil production, associated gas, and the NGL that come with that. I think having flexibility benefits Companies like us, because it's so hard to predict what will be favored when. But if you have flexibility, you tend to do well in a range of environments. And I think our Company has that both in the U.S. and in Europe. And your second question about competitiveness in Europe and the carbon initiatives. Well, there's Is a lot of legislation being considered. The way I think about it is that first of all, relative competitiveness is really important. And I think within the region, we have one of the most competitive asset basis. We've built that through all the work we did earlier in the last decade.  Over time you could see regulation that provides for border adjustments or things that will help protect the industrial economy in Europe. I think industrial employment is a very important part of the European economy. And I can't imagine that will just attrit away. So I always ask my team to focus on regional competitiveness, and make sure that we're at the most competitive end of the cost curve regionally. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wishing you the best, Bob, we'll definitely miss you. Something you could expand a little bit on your Ethylene outlook. You mentioned the supply is abundant now. We do have some new crackers coming online plus the potential ramp of ethane exports. So for those incremental demand, is that something that you think would be covered by incremental production? Just given the recent increase in the rig count or would it need to pull from, its either like rejection or inventory? Bob Patel : Thank you, Matt. It's been a pleasure working with you as well. I've had lots of discussions with some of our largest suppliers on this topic, and I think with new capacity coming here in Corpus, and more demand for ethane, my sense is that between the amount that's rejected today, that could be recovered. And incremental output from the independents who are starting to ramp up in the Permian, I think there's enough ethane. The price setter on ethane, I continue to believe will be natural gas with a modest frac spread to get to the ethane price. We've done a lot of work on this and we think that likely is a scenario. And then longer term, I think the feedstock flexibility here in the U.S. will serve us well. As the various scenarios play out, and you could make a good argument for -- well, the oil to gas ratio widening as we get past summer of 22 and into the next couple of three years. Operator : Thanks you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Patel for closing remarks. Bob Patel : Thank you again for all the thoughtful questions. Let me offer a few closing remarks. First of all, we continue to believe that demand will remain strong well into 2022 for all of our products and markets we serve. Though we are likely to face some margin pressure from rising energy and feedstock costs, we expect that our earnings and cash flow will remain robust. LyondellBasell has an array of options to create shareholder value, ranging from a growing dividend, share repurchases, and value trading M&A.  It's been my sincere pleasure and honor to serve and privilege to serve as CEO and support of our incredible employees and shareholders for nearly 7 years. We've built an incredibly strong Company over the past 12 years and I'm thankful to have been a part of it. I've enjoyed getting to know all of you and working with you. And we remain very optimistic about the future of LYB. Thank you and best wishes to all of you. We're now adjourned. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference.

Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today\u2019s call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13725132. During today\u2019s call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, the current environment and our near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Ken, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out, or LIFO, accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized a non-cash impairment of $624 million that reflected our ongoing evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Lane : Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today and as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to take a moment and thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead LyondellBasell as Interim CEO until Peter Vanacker can join the company at the end of the second quarter. For the past 30 years, I have worked in the chemical industry in roles spanning manufacturing, major projects, strategy and business leadership with assignments in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Since 2019, I have had the pleasure of leading LyondellBasell\u2019s global Olefins and Polyolefins businesses. Our company is in great shape and we have good momentum. I want to emphasize that our strategy remains unchanged and I will keep our company moving forward, continuing to execute our strategy and ensuring Peter has a successful start. I will work closely with our Board, the LyondellBasell leadership team and our 19,000 talented employees to advance our growth projects, actively manage our business portfolio, and ensure we remain consistent with our goals of being the best operated and most valued company in our industry. Now moving on to the business discussion, as Dave mentioned, a set of slides accompanies today\u2019s call and is available on our website. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 and review some highlights for the past year. 2021 earnings were $18.19 per share, with $9.3 billion of EBITDA. Earnings per share were more than 3x higher than 2020 and EBITDA improved by 140%. Our company\u2019s growing portfolio of assets delivered EBITDA that exceeded our previous best year by 15% and resulted in $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, we generated a 25% return on invested capital during 2021. Our results provide an indicator of how LyondellBasell\u2019s earnings power is stepping up relative to the performance we delivered over the prior decade. Our 2021 performance was supported by strong demand for our products, supply constraints across our industry and our growth investments. Favorable markets drove 7 consecutive months of contract price increases for polyethylene in the United States. In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, strong demand for polyurethanes drove record earnings from our leading propylene oxide and derivatives business. A robust market for building and construction materials served to increase margins across our acetyls value chain. Also, rebounding demand for transportation fuels, self-help cost reductions and higher operating rates enabled our Refining segment to return to profitability in both the third and the fourth quarters. I want to emphasize that we are maintaining our commitment to a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our team worked diligently to convert our EBITDA into $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. After investing $1.9 billion to maintain our assets and fund additional profit-generating investments, $5.7 billion of free cash flow remained. We rewarded investors by deploying $4.44 per share in dividends and repurchasing over 5 million shares. Last but not least, we delivered on our commitments and strengthened our balance sheet with $4 billion of long-term debt reduction. Our strategy is to identify, develop and capture opportunities through all phases of business cycles. During 2021, we capitalized on those opportunities. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. Our core commitments to health and safety remain steadfast. The tragic incident that resulted in two fatalities and several injuries at our acetic acid plant last July reminds us of why we work so diligently toward our goal of flawless safety performance. We learn from experience and seek to further bolster our GoalZERO work environment to prevent these incidents from recurring. On Slide 4, you can see that during 2021, our team continued to deliver recordable incident rates that are among the lowest for industry. I\u2019m particularly proud of our team\u2019s performance over the final months of 2021 as we engaged the entire organization and leadership teams of our largest contractors to reduce recordable incident rates across our employee and contractor workforce each month during the second half of the year. Now please turn to Slide 5 to review our quarterly profitability. While increased costs for feedstocks and energy continue to compress margins from second quarter highs, demand for our products remain strong. Our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, exceeding the results of the prior year quarter by 60%. Increased energy costs were particularly impactful for our European O&P and I&D operations, where on some days in December, Dutch natural gas prices exceeded $50 per million BTU. Higher natural gas prices directly impact our fuel costs, but also show up as higher costs for our purchased electricity and steam. Nonetheless, seasonal patterns for our businesses typically trend downward at the end of the year, and the $2 billion of EBITDA we earned during the fourth quarter of 2021 is reflective of healthy markets for our products. The downward trends we saw in the fourth quarter seem to be abating with margins stabilizing in January. During the remainder of the first quarter, we could see inflection on stronger seasonal demand and supply constraints. With most economists expecting 2022 global GDP growth rates to exceed historical averages at roughly 4%, we remain constructive on the outlook for our businesses. New capacity will come online in 2022 but will largely be needed to meet growing demand from well-funded consumers, address order backlogs as supply chains normalize and support further global reopening from the pandemic. Slide 6 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability over the past decade. During the period from 2011 to 2019, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Our performance in 2021 exceeded the 2015 peak by 15%. While 2021 was a particularly strong year for our core markets, we have confidence that the growth investments we brought online since 2018 will drive a sustainable step-change improvement in our profitability over the next decade. The formation of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment in 2018 provided visibility into LyondellBasell\u2019s sizable legacy compounding business. The businesses we acquired that year from A. Schulman added approximately $200 million in annual EBITDA. Since 2018, the APS segment has been challenged by production constraints in their largest market : plastic compounds used in vehicle production. Despite high consumer demand, automotive production has been held back by COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns and shortages of semiconductors. With global vehicle production expected to rebound by 9% in 2022 and an additional 10% in 2023, we expect to reach higher utilization across our APS segment. Increased capacity utilization will enable the realization of volume-driven synergies. In 2020, we commissioned the first world-scale plant utilizing LyondellBasell\u2019s proprietary Hyperzone technology for high-density polyethylene. We have a long and successful track record of introducing new polyolefin technologies. Each new generation of technology encounters initial challenges, and we are making good progress working through those with our first Hyperzone asset. Our manufacturing and R&D teams have been working diligently to improve reliability. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to bring down the Hyperzone plant and make some modifications. While it\u2019s still early days, we are highly encouraged by the performance of the plant since restarting in December. It\u2019s my expectation that we will realize a greater share of the volume and margin benefits from this investment during 2022. In 2020, we invested and integrated cracker joint ventures in China and Louisiana, where new assets were fully built and generated immediate returns. In 2022, we are starting up 2 new propylene oxide plants, a joint venture in China and a wholly owned asset in Houston that will expand LyondellBasell\u2019s ownership capacity for propylene oxide by nearly 50%. I\u2019m pleased to report that the China plant is already producing on-spec products and rapidly ramping up rates. Our larger PO/TBA facility in Houston is progressing on schedule for start-up during the end of this year. Both propylene oxide facilities are starting up with tight markets and all-time high margins for this intermediate chemical that is essential for the production of polyurethanes and other downstream products. Taken together, our growth investments give us the confidence that we will step up earnings in the current decade. On Slide 7, I would like to highlight how we are also stepping up our progress on sustainability. In April, we introduced our Circulen family of polymers produced using recycled and renewable-based feedstocks that reduce our reliance on fossil-based raw materials. These products are targeted at the rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. In October, we extended the Circulen brand to the compounds and solutions provided by our APS segment. All of this is part of LyondellBasell\u2019s commitment to annually produce and market 2 million tons of recycled and renewable based polymers by 2030. 2022 will be an exciting year for our proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling technology. In December, our team commissioned upgrades to our pilot facility, enabling us to determine the extent of our technology advantage and guide an investment decision for our first commercial-scale facility. This technology provides LyondellBasell with an opportunity to be a leader in the rapidly growing markets for circular plastics. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and the goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. We also increased our 2030 ambition and now aim to reduce absolute emissions by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the near-term, we don\u2019t expect significant increases in our overall capital budget as reduced spending associated with the completion of our PO/TBA project in 2022 should offset an increasing share for circular and climate-related investments going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael for him to describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Ken and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 and let me begin by highlighting our substantial cash generation during 2021. LyondellBasell delivered record cash from operations and free cash flow in 2021. Our team worked diligently to efficiently convert 82% of our EBITDA into cash for the year despite increased working capital needs to support higher prices. After accounting for sustaining capital investments, we achieved a 23% free operating cash flow yield relative to our market capitalization. Let\u2019s continue with Slide 9 and review the details of how we deployed all of this cash last year. During 2021, we paid dividends and repurchased shares to provide a total of $2 billion in returns for shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. 2021 represents our 11th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. At the same time, we reduced our long-term debt by $4 billion and further bolstered our balance sheet by paying down $300 million of short-term commercial paper. Net interest expense increased to $510 million, higher than our guidance at the beginning of 2021, largely due to debt extinguishment costs. Our current portfolio supports our solid investment-grade balance sheet, and we do not see the need for additional debt reduction. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.4 billion of cash and available liquidity. Now I\u2019d like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10. As Ken mentioned, our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected strong demand for our products, offset by higher costs for feedstocks and energy, primarily in our O&P Europe, Asia, International, I&D and APS segments. Let\u2019s begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Americas segment. Fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA was $1.3 billion, $306 million lower than the third quarter. Margins declined on lower pricing for both Olefins and Polyolefins. Olefin results decreased approximately $190 million compared to third quarter 2021 due to margin declines driven by lower ethylene and propylene prices. Although we operated our North American ethylene crackers at 97%, sales volumes remained relatively unchanged as we built inventory to support maintenance downtime planned for the first quarter. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $120 million lower than the third quarter, primarily due to a decrease in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. Polyethylene, however, posted record volumes driven by strong demand and increased production from our Hyperzone facility in December. O&P Americas posted record EBITDA of $5.3 billion for the full year, $3.5 billion higher than 2020. Margins increased for both Olefins and Polyolefins as higher product prices outpaced higher cost. Demand for nondurable packaging and consumer goods remained strong and led to increased volumes for both ethylene and polyethylene. Based on increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply due to higher industry cracker maintenance, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and review typical seasonal trends in the U.S. polyethylene market. After tight markets escalated prices over the first three quarters of 2021, declines in polyethylene contract prices during the fourth quarter of last year captured market attention. As illustrated by the green line on the chart, demand typically rises during the first quarter, stabilizes in the second quarter and grows again during the second season of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, orders for polymers slow due to holiday downtime and as market participants strive to minimize their year-end inventories. The blue line indicates that polyethylene pricing logically follows these seasonal demand trends. Simply put, lower fourth quarter prices are a common occurrence. In contrast, the industry usually sees a rebound in demand and pricing during the first quarter. Orders increase as customers resume full production. During February and March, export demand often improves following the Lunar New Year holiday. In 2022, industry consultants are forecasting planned maintenance for U.S. ethylene crackers will be 3x higher than normal, with about 15% of U.S. capacity taking maintenance downtime. Similarly, about 10% of European ethylene capacity will be down for maintenance during the first half of 2022. Ethylene cracker outages often constrain downstream polyethylene production. In summary, the confluence of seasonal trends, industry downtime and robust consumer demand should provide support for polyethylene pricing during the first quarter of 2022. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher cost and lower spreads reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets, resulting in a fourth quarter EBITDA of $155 million, $319 million lower than the third quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $180 million as margins decreased driven by higher feedstock and energy cost despite higher ethylene and propylene prices. We operate our crackers at a rate of 70% due to planned maintenance. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $100 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal demand drove declines in polyolefin price spreads relative to monomer cost and reduced volumes. Declining polyolefin spreads and higher energy costs also affected our joint venture equity income by about $15 million. Full year EBITDA increased $923 million compared to 2020. Olefins margins declined due to higher feedstock costs, outpacing increased ethylene and propylene prices. Combined polyolefin results and our joint venture equity income increased by more than $815 million and $125 million, respectively, driven by higher margins with increases in polyolefin prices. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $252 million, a decline of $96 million from the third quarter of 2021. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products and last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $95 million muted margin improvements in our propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemical businesses. Fourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results remained relatively unchanged, with higher margins offset by lower volumes due to planned maintenance. Intermediate chemicals results increased about $65 million with the resumption of our acetyls production.  Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased approximately $85 million as margins declined due to higher butane feedstock costs. For the full year, strong demand and a tight market drove margin increases in most businesses, resulting in EBITDA of $1.4 billion, $535 million higher than 2020. Volumes declined due to reduced exports of our propylene oxide and derivative products. In the first quarter of 2022, we expect margins to improve for our Oxyfuels & Related Products business with lower butane feedstock costs. Our volumes are expected to increase during the first quarter, supported by continued strong demand for our propylene oxide and derivatives and acetyls products. Now let\u2019s move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Customer supply chain constraints and high raw material costs hindered results with fourth quarter EBITDA of $24 million, $97 million lower than the third quarter. The segment incurred last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $55 million during the quarter. Results for the Compounding & Solutions businesses decreased due to margin declines driven by higher raw material costs. Volumes decreased with continued supply chain constraints in the automotive manufacturing market. Results for our advanced polymer businesses were relatively unchanged, with margin improvement offset by volume declines. Full year EBITDA for the segment was $409 million, a $28 million increase over 2020. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from a $35 million reduction in integration costs. Margins increased with higher spreads and volumes, increased with higher building and construction demand for our advanced polymer businesses. We expect volumes to improve as automotive manufacturers begin to ramp up production, particularly for products from our Compounding & Solutions business. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $150 million, a $109 million improvement compared to the third quarter of 2021. Results excluded a noncash impairment charge of $624 million, reflecting our ongoing evaluation of strategic options. Results for the quarter benefited from approximately $50 million due to LIFO effects from reduced inventory volumes. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to a better product mix and an increase in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark crack spread to about $23.58 per barrel. We operated the refinery at near-full rates of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput at 266,000 barrels per day. Full year EBITDA increased $289 million compared to 2020 or breakeven for the year. Comparisons exclude impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2020. Approximately $45 million of LIFO changes benefited the segment for 2021. Refining margins improved with higher demand for gasoline and jet fuel, which drove the Maya 2-1-1 spread from a historically low point in 2020 at an average of $12.63 to $20.87 per barrel in 2021. Crude throughput improved to 231,000 barrels per day in response to higher market demand. Refining margins are expected to improve slightly, with crack spreads estimated to be about $25 per barrel. We plan to operate the refinery at more than 90% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 17 as we review the results of our Technology segment. All-time high levels of licensing revenue and catalyst volumes drove EBITDA to new records of $173 million for the fourth quarter and $514 million for the full year. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability will be lower, similar to levels in the first quarter of 2021. Before I turn the call over to Ken, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2022 on Slide 18. We are planning to invest approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures during 2022. Approximately $0.9 billion is targeted toward profit-generating growth projects, with the balance supporting sustaining maintenance. The majority of our 2022 growth investment is associated with the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston. We have a fairly typical schedule of planned maintenance for 2022 with a total of three major cracker turnarounds. We will also have a couple of turnarounds in our I&D segment during the second quarter. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2022 EBITDA by approximately $265 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. The U.S. cracker turnaround is scheduled for the La Porte, Texas site in the first quarter and expected it to impact O&P America\u2019s quarterly EBITDA by approximately $125 million. The European cracker turnarounds will occur at our French cracker during the first and second quarters and are smaller cracker in Wesseling, Germany during the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The maintenance is expected to impact O&P EAI quarterly EBITDA by approximately $25 million, $15 million, $10 million, and $10 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively. Plant maintenance at our butanediol facility in one of our two propylene oxide units located in Channelview, Texas is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million. We expect 2022 net interest expense will be approximately $340 million after netting capitalized interest of about $95 million. 2022 book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be approximately $1.3 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2022 totaling approximately $70 million with approximately $55 million of pension expense for the year. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate to be lower than our ETR. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken. Ken? Ken Lane : Thank you, Michael. So let me summarize the year\u2019s highlights and our outlook with Slide 19. In 2021, LyondellBasell maintained our disciplined focus on safety, operational excellence and reliability to maximize returns during a year of exceptional markets. Our 2021 results were 15% above prior benchmarks and are indicative of how LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability is stepping up from prior levels. Many of our growth investments are providing returns today with further contributions expected over the next several years. In 2022, we will expand our propylene oxide capacity by 50% with the start of two new plants in China and Texas. We are improving the performance of our Hyperzone polyethylene technology to deliver enhanced product performance for our customers. As supply chains normalize and automotive production begins to catch up with high consumer demand, we anticipate higher volumes and earnings from our APS segment. Also, improving markets for fuels bodes well for our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses. Our disciplined approach carries through to our capital allocation strategy. We\u2019re providing shareholders with increasing returns from higher dividends and the resumption of share repurchases. In 2021, we de-leveraged our balance sheet and demonstrated our commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating. With our strong credit metrics, we have no near-term need for further de-leveraging. In 2022, about 40% of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward profit-generating projects, including our new propylene oxide facility in Texas. The rapidly growing market for more sustainable plastics represents one of the greatest opportunities that lies ahead for LyondellBasell. We have launched our Circulen brand, and we\u2019re committed to producing and marketing at least 2 million tons of circular and renewable-based polymers by 2030. At the same time, we will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. At LyondellBasell, we believe our work in sustainability is both good for our planet and good for our business. In summary, we will continue to execute on our disciplined approach and build on the strong momentum to deliver sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. We\u2019re now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bob Koort : Thank you very much. Ken, I was curious if you could tell us what your expectation is on the profile of cash flow and usage over the next couple of years. I mean it looks like you\u2019ll have 2 or 3 excess free cash after deviate after CapEx. And along those lines, can you give us a sense of what the options and appetite on the Sasol option are? Ken Lane : Sure, Bob. Thank you for your question. Like I said previously, there is no change to our capital allocation strategy. And what I\u2019ll do is just ask Michael to talk a little bit more about the options going forward, and then maybe I\u2019ll come back and talk about Sasol after that. Michael McMurray : Perfect. Good morning, Bob. I mean a couple of things that I\u2019d say. I think first and foremost, I\u2019d say really good execution by the team in 2021 in converting EBITDA into free cash flow. It was a record year of cash generation both from an operating cash perspective, but also from a free cash flow perspective as well. And we also de-levered the balance sheet by $4 billion last year, which I think is pretty impressive. And then on top of that last year, we returned $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. So as we look forward, we\u2019re expecting another year of strong cash generation. The balance sheet is in great shape, so there is no need to do any further de-levering. Our growth investments are paying dividends, which is good news. Working capital this year should be a source of free cash flow. Last year, it consumed a significant amount of free cash flow. And then CapEx is largely flat year-on-year. It\u2019s our expectation with our current outlook that we will responsibly grow the dividend. As you saw in the fourth quarter and also in the third quarter of last year, buybacks are in the mix. So we restarted buybacks in September of \u201821. And when we see value, we will continue to buy our shares. And from an M&A perspective, you can expect that LyondellBasell is going to continue to operate in a very, very disciplined way. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ken to give a few comments about Sasol. Ken Lane : Yes, Bob. So for Sasol, we\u2019ve commented before that it\u2019s our desire and intent to own the other half of that joint venture. We\u2019re very happy with the partnership. It obviously performed very well in 2021. But of course, there is a buyer and a seller, and our mutual interests are going to have to be aligned in order to be able to come to a conclusion on the transaction. So timing is a little bit hard to predict. But I would still say that it is going to be in the midterm. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Do you expect your cash balance at the end of the year to be very different from what it is right now? And are cost pressures in your European olefins business in the first quarter greater than what they were in the fourth? Michael McMurray : Hi. Good morning, Jeff, I\u2019ll take the first question, and I\u2019ll let Ken take the second one. So we ended the year with about $1.5 billion of cash on sheet. I think you heard me just say in my previous answer that we will grow the dividend responsibly. We will buy our shares when we see value. That said, as we move throughout the year, it\u2019s possible that we could build a little bit of additional cash on sheet. Ken Lane : And just in terms of the cost pressure in Europe, yes, we saw really an unprecedented spike in energy costs in Europe in the fourth quarter. And we started taking action then to be able to give us a little bit of insulation from that and started to move some surcharges into the market to be able to share some of that burden. So that is going to help us in the first quarter offset some of that. But the cost pressures that we saw in Europe are obviously going to be continuing as you look at the energy prices where they are today. But we\u2019re doing what we can to offset where possible. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. Just curious on your thoughts on pricing for polyethylene near-term, there are a couple of announcements out there for February, March. And given that there is some capacity or a lot of capacity coming on in 2Q and in North America and the rest of the world, just any thoughts on how you see that unfolding over the year and whether you think that capacity can be absorbed? Thank you. Ken Lane : Sure. Thank you for the question, Mike. Look, we continue to see strong demand for polymers, and we expect that to continue in 2022. As markets recover from the pandemic, and especially the largest market in China and the supply chain constraints are worked through, we do expect that the market growth is going to be able to absorb a lot of the new capacity that\u2019s coming online. We still expect to see effective operating rates for polyethylene at greater than 90%, and that\u2019s obviously going to be supportive of margins going forward. We did see a downward trend in the prices in the fourth quarter, but we are seeing pricing find a floor. And as we come into the seasonally higher demand of the second quarter, I do expect that there is going to be good support for price increases going forward. We\u2019re already seeing spot pricing increasing pretty much in all regions, which is a good indicator. And remember as well, just going back to volume, December was the second-strongest demand month of 2021, which is pretty unusual when you look at historical demand patterns. With that and the combined impact of all of the downtime that we\u2019re expecting to see on both sides of the Atlantic and the U.S. and Europe, we\u2019re going to see markets continue to be tight, and we expect that to be supportive for pricing going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Bhavesh Lodaya : This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So on the refinery you are competing with a few other refineries looking for a potential transaction. Could you provide an update on the strategic review process or a potential sale of the refinery? And then what would be the next best option if you are not able to do the transaction, because clearly, earnings are pretty strong these days? Thanks. Ken Lane : Sure, Bhavesh. Thank you for your question. And look as we\u2019ve communicated before, we\u2019re exploring strategic options for this business and we do continue to believe that the asset has a higher value as part of the \u2013 an integrated network. I am sure you can appreciate we\u2019re \u2013 there is really not more that we can say at this time. We\u2019re in the middle of that process as we speak. And with where we are right now, I hope to be able to provide more details of the outcome and in the next few months. But that\u2019s really all that I can say at this point. Michael, I don\u2019t know if you wanted to add anything? Michael McMurray : No, I think. Stay tuned. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess \u2013 yes, I just wanted to delve in a little bit more on polyethylene and polypropylene. So, on polyethylene, obviously, we have seen some price deterioration the last couple of months. However, there seems to be some feedstock support as you go into Q1 that\u2019s keeping prices up a little bit. Some of your competitors have announced price increases as well. So, do you think that those are more tactics to prevent price erosion, or is there real opportunity to get some price as we move through Q1? And then on polypropylene, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have the same issues with capacity additions that polyethylene faces. So, is there any opportunity for increased pricing in polypropylene, especially if auto production kind of surprise us to the upside? Thanks. Ken Lane : Hi Arun, thank you for the question. Well, listen, like I had said before, I really do believe that with the robust demand that we are seeing in the markets and the pent-up demand that is still in the market yet to come. We saw in the second half of the year last year the largest market in China weakening in the second half of the year as they were approaching the Olympics and trying to keep the pandemic under control. There is a lot of demand that I believe is still yet to come back, and we are going to see that, I believe sometime in the middle of the year in the spring. And so that is going to be supportive overall. I don\u2019t think that this is related just to feedstock. It really is that demand is strong and supply is tighter than probably most people would expect. For polypropylene, certainly, we are optimistic for polypropylene this year where our portfolio is about 15% or so exposed to automotive. And that market is going to come back this year and that\u2019s also going to be supportive for polypropylene as we move forward in the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Yes. Good morning and nice to speak with you again Ken. I appreciate the Slide 18 that talks about your planned maintenance impact for 2022 of $265 million. Can you put that into context as to what your plans, and more importantly, what\u2019s your unplanned impacts were in 2021 and to that extent also if you can comment a little bit about the propylene oxide capacity additions? When should we anticipate seeing financial impacts from those capacity additions? Thank you. Ken Lane : Yes. Frank, good to hear from you as well. Thank you for the question. So look, in 2021, obviously, the biggest impact in terms of unplanned outage was Winter Storm Uri, which we don\u2019t expect that to recur obviously in 2022. So, that had an impact of $400 million to $500 million. So, that was one that is I guess the most material as you would call it. Then we had some other downtime in acetyls as well as at our La Porte olefins cracker. So net-net, that downtime last year was very high relative to history, the unplanned downtime. We certainly don\u2019t expect to see that level of downtime this year. Now if you look at the planned outages, the net impact of the planned outages from \u201821 to \u201822, it\u2019s going to be about a $50 million headwind because we are going to have a little bit higher planned downtime this year. Michael McMurray : In the first quarter. Ken Lane : In the first quarter, yes, sorry. David Kinney : And I would just add, I would caution \u2013 this is Dave, Frank. I would just caution that you shouldn\u2019t just add back that $400 million because margins really inflated on our downtime. So, that\u2019s why we have been hesitant to try to quantify the unplanned downtime from last year because there is a chicken-and-egg effect between margins and volume. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you very much. So, your team actually appears quite content with the Sasol deal, and I understand we will have to await an outcome on that front. But are there other similar facility and marketing deals your team would be interested in across the globe, perhaps anything else in the U.S. or Asia? Ken Lane : So look, thank you, Chris, for the question. We have been \u2013 in the last couple of years, we have been implementing several growth projects, including new joint ventures in China and the U.S. We are always looking for opportunities that provide good returns to the company and especially in our core businesses. And we will continue to do that, especially to look for opportunities through the cycle. And right now, there is not anything that I can say specifically. We have talked about the Sasol opportunity, but there is really nothing more that I can comment on at this time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide an update on your circular economy initiatives. I think you have a goal of 2 million tons by 2030. How do we get there from here? Maybe you could just talk about what\u2019s going on at QCP and MoReTec and what the decision tree looks like in terms of growth and potential capital needs to fund that growth? Ken Lane : Sure, Kevin. Thank you for the question. Yes, we have set some ambitious targets for circularity, and it\u2019s our intent to be a leader in the circular plastics space. We do see this market developing rapidly, and it\u2019s an exciting area of growth that fits really well with our capabilities. So, it\u2019s going to be a clear focus for us. Both mechanical and advanced recycling are going to be areas that we are concentrating on as well as renewable products. As you know, we have mentioned previously that we are developing our own technology for advanced recycling called MoReTec. And we expect really to be able to assess the extent of that technology\u2019s advantage here in the next few months. Following that, we will be deciding on an initial commercial investment that should be completed around the middle of the decade. At the same time, we are looking at other paths to be able to reach that volume target. And we will be doing things like buying recycled and renewable feedstocks that we can track in our existing assets. And that of course, requires little or really no capital investment. So, all of these things are going to be levers that we are going to be pulling, working very closely with our customers and innovating with them on applications that we can roll out over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Okay. Good morning guys. Three questions around the PO plants coming up. So, first is just technically, is there any reason to think we may have issues with the ramp up of this, let\u2019s say, like Hyperzone, or is this an older technology that you feel more comfortable about the ramp up? Two, what will the ramp up look like? I mean when you look at the market today, how long will it take to get those plants or at least the products from those plants mostly sold out? And then the third one is, just given the market you see today, is the EBITDA contribution from these plants similar to what was expected historically? Ken Lane : Thank you for the question, Duffy. Look, the technology that we are building, the PO/TBA technology that we are building, is the most competitive in the world. So, I do want to just make sure we point that out. We are very confident in the technology. It\u2019s a technology that we operate today. It\u2019s a very large and complex plant, as you can imagine. So, I am not going to say that there is no risk. But from a technology standpoint, I really don\u2019t see a risk. Then to your question just around the ramp up, we will be ramping up beginning next year. And we see very good demand, and our teams are making very good progress on contracting the volume from that asset. I can tell you as well for the plant in China, the markets are very good there. And the growth in polyurethane is going to be able to absorb this new capacity that we are bringing on stream. In terms of the EBITDA impact, I would say, yes, for modeling purposes, you should be expecting the EBITDA contribution to be similar to what we have seen in the past. David Kinney : And Duffy, just for numbers, this is our sixth PO/TBA plant that we have built. So, good experience with it, definitely not number one. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thanks. Was the Technology segment just timing or has something happened there that shift the historical range up? So, when it drops off, your guidance is for it to come back down. But does it come back down within the normal range, or has the range moved up here as well? Ken Lane : Yes. Thank you for your question, John. Michael, do you want to comment on that? Michael McMurray : Sure. Hi John. So listen, the technology business had a great year overall. So, record EBITDA, all-time high licensing revenue and catalyst volumes, primarily driven by Asia. You are right. So, Q4 did exceed even our expectations. There were a number of licenses that we are expecting to book in the first quarter that got done in the fourth quarter. So, you shouldn\u2019t expect that trend to continue. And it\u2019s kind of our expectation that the first quarter of this year should look a lot like the first quarter of last year. But it is a great business. It\u2019s kind of like a razor-blade business, right. So, you sell licenses and then you continue to sell catalysts for a long, long time at great profits. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Ken. I wanted to revisit near-term sort of pricing dynamics in polyethylene. Just want to get a bit more granular. Look I mean we know for Q1, roughly, call it, around $0.08 a pound worth of price hikes on the table. And you guys sort of pointed out that around 15% of U.S. capacity is undergoing maintenance in Q1. So obviously, that\u2019s supportive. My question really is that, I mean with roughly 8 million tons of polyethylene capacity expected to come online this year, I mean could there be a situation where it\u2019s a strong first half and then we sort of go down a cliff in the back half of the year in terms of pricing? And just paring that with the demand side, look, I mean if all of that 8 million tons of capacity comes online this year, for demand to keep pace with that, global demand growth would need to be north of 7%. So, are you guys sort of \u2013 as you talk about demand strength, are you looking for demand growth at those elevated levels? Ken Lane : Good morning Hassan. Thanks again for the question. Listen, if you look historically, years following when we have not seen good global growth, especially coming out of a year like we did with 2020, you can see double-digit growth rates even in China. And those types of growth years do typically occur once we see a snapback. And they are hard to predict, but they have occurred in the past. So, you can never bank on that. But my expectation is that the 8 million tons, there will be a combination of things that you see. All of the capacity is not going to be coming online exactly as we expect. Everybody understands that there are some constraints in China around that, especially with the dual control limitations. But the demand is going to come back and we have seen that in the past. So, a combination of some slower ramp-up of the capacity coming on, stronger demand, I certainly don\u2019t see a cliff in the second half of the year. I see it completely the opposite to that right now, but that\u2019s our view going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Hey. Good morning Ken. Just a couple of questions. First on \u2013 there have been some news that comonomer availability like hexane has been in short supply. Is that impacting production for the industry and for you? And when do you think you will normalize that? And then I think last quarter, you guys had talked about reducing your Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30% by 2030. How much capital spending do you think you need to have in order to achieve that? Thank you. Ken Lane : Thank you, P.J. Good morning. Yes, so there is a shortage of hexane in the market. And that combined with downtime at some of the linear low plants both in the U.S. and in Europe, has tightened that market pretty significantly. Now I will tell you that we are not having any constraints on hexane with our linear low business. So, that\u2019s good news. But for the industry, yes, there is tightness in that market, and I expect that that\u2019s going to continue in the short-term. Now going back to your question around our targets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 reductions that we have announced, in the next few years, we will be able to accommodate all of the things that we are looking at with our $2 billion capital spending. Our focus really in the next few years is going to be capturing the low-hanging fruit, really to make the first significant steps in the process of ramping up to the target in 2030. And that\u2019s going to include things like improved energy efficiency and some emission-reduction programs at our sites that really require little or no investment. Another low-capital enabler for our carbon-reduction targets is also going to be the increased utilization of renewable energy. So, we expect that within the next few years, the amount of capital that we have guided to, the $2 billion is going to be adequate for us to be able to get started on meeting these commitments. And then we will be identifying projects and developing detailed plans to achieve the full target in the second half of the decade. And that\u2019s likely to result in some increased capital, but we will have more to communicate on that later. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Ken and Michael, can you just discuss oxyfuels? How \u2013 what was the earnings decline in 2021 and what you are expecting for ramp-up, a return back to some higher normal high levels of profitability in 2022? Ken Lane : Sure, David. I will start and then I will hand it over to Michael, let him comment a little bit. Oxyfuels, we had \u2013 especially in the fourth quarter, we had lower volumes, we had significantly lower volumes and margin challenges with butane feedstock prices running up. We are seeing that improving coming into the first quarter. So, we will see the volumes coming back and some relief with the butane feedstock pricing. Michael, I don\u2019t know if you want to add something to that. Michael McMurray : No. I mean maybe just a couple of other comments around the I&D business for the quarter and around oxyfuels. So, don\u2019t forget in the quarter itself, there was a $95 million LIFO charge, which obviously will not be there in the first quarter of this year. And then maybe to put some numbers around kind of the feedstock drag in the quarter within oxyfuels, it was about $85 million. So, it was pretty significant related to butane. And as Ken said, butane prices have already started to ease off. And it\u2019s our expectation as we move through the year that, that\u2019s going to continue. And then maybe one other thing I would just point out about this business. I mean this business is kind of the comonomer or kind of mail person of chemical businesses. It has a long track record, if you look back over the last decade, of earning kind of $400 million-plus EBITDA. So, go back and look over the last 10 years, we are confident it\u2019s going to get back to its historic earning power. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hello. Hi. This is Sean on for Steve. So, in the last few weeks, you have seen a real run-up in Brent prices and also on nat gas. So, I was just wondering what are your views on the possible tailwind we might see a re-widening of the oil-gas ratio, if we see a supply response on the nat gas side? Ken Lane : Sure. Hi Sean. We definitely see going forward the oil-to-gas ratio being favorable for our position in the U.S. markets. The high oil prices is certainly going to continue to pressure margins in Asia and Europe. But overall, net-net, we are expecting to see a continued favorable oil to gas ratio. David Kinney : Yes. In Asia, it\u2019s really tight, Sean. I mean the spread between naphtha and polyethylene is like $200, $300 per ton. That\u2019s a historic lows. It just can\u2019t stay there. So, oil is going to pressure polyethylene prices upwards in Asia, and that\u2019s good for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe sticking on feedstocks, do you have any thoughts on overall ethane availability? We have seen the ethane premium to natural gas move out to about $0.10. I think last year, it was closer to $0.05. And maybe that\u2019s a function of some new plants starting up. But what\u2019s your outlook on this going forward? Ken Lane : Good morning Matthew. Thanks for your question. Well, listen, ethane inventories are still healthy and production is improving, especially in the Permian and the Bakken. So, even with the new crackers coming online, there is still excess ethane that\u2019s being rejected. And as production recovers and natural gas prices normalize, I do expect that ethane is going to remain the preferred feedstock. I will just add, too, that ethane rejection has only decreased slightly and still is about 800,000 barrels a day. And with the recovery having increased, there is really plenty of supply available. Operator : Thank you. I am showing that there are no further questions. I will turn it back to Mr. Lane for closing comments. Ken Lane : Okay. So listen, thank you again for all the thoughtful questions. Just before we close, I want to emphasize that our strategy remains unchanged. We have got great momentum, and we are going to continue focusing on safety, operational excellence as well as our disciplined approach to capital allocation. So, thank you very much for your interest in LyondellBasell. And we look forward to updating you on the progress at the end of April. Have a great weekend and stay safe. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, Alex. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.  Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available at our Investor Relations website.  Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.  A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until May 29 by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13727006.  During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current market and our near-term outlook.  Before turning the call over to Ken, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, in the impairments that we have discussed on past calls. LCM adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. Impairment charges were recognized to write down assets to their estimated fair value. Impairments include the noncash impairment of $624 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 that reflects our evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery.  Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of impairments and LCM inventory adjustments.  With that being said, I now would like to turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2022 results. Today's teleconference marks my second earnings call as the interim CEO of LyondellBasell. And I would like to thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead the company over the past few months. Our incoming CEO, Peter Vanacker, joined our Board on February 25, and we're looking forward to him assuming his role as Chief Executive Officer on May 23. Peter and I have been talking over the past several months to ensure a smooth transition and a successful start to his leadership of our company. I know that Peter is very eager to engage with our employees, customers, investors and suppliers to help us build upon the momentum we have underway in LyondellBasell. Before we get into the results, I would like to take a moment to address the tragic and unprovoked attacks unfolding in Ukraine. My heart breaks seeing so many people devastated and the resulting humanitarian crisis. At LyondellBasell, we are working to address the impacts of this crisis through our global corporate citizenship program, Advancing Good. The company and our employees have collectively donated more than $600,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Medical Corp.  LyondellBasell's presence in Russia and Ukraine is fairly limited. Less than 0.3% of our 2021 revenue came from Russia and a negligible amount from Ukraine. In March, we announced that LyondellBasell will not enter into any new business transactions or relationships with Russian state-owned entities. We also intend to discontinue business relationships with those companies to the extent legally possible.  Of course, we are also complying with all U.S. and international sanctions. While we have no manufacturing sites in Russia or Ukraine, we do have about 30 employees working in offices in Russia. Last week, we made the difficult decision to cease operations at our Moscow and Togliati offices. We have a local team in place to support our employees during this transition period.  At LyondellBasell, we believe in the power of many, and we hope many of you find ways to support the Ukrainian people and influence peace and stability across Europe.  Now let's review our first quarter results, starting with Slide 3. LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from solid global demand and improving markets for products from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $4 per share of earnings, $2 billion of EBITDA and $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities.  The start of the year is typically a seasonally slow period for the petrochemical industry. 2022 marks the first time since 2015 where LyondellBasell earned $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter, and our income of $4 per share establishes a new first quarter earnings per share record for the company. Despite a turbulent backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, ongoing supply chain challenges, and volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, LyondellBasell is off to a great start in 2022. Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership remains a consistent and unwavering component of our company's culture. In 2022, our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors has improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This year, we are emphasizing the importance of instilling safety-related touch points during interactions that occur naturally throughout the workday at our facilities. Whether it's planned or spontaneous, these daily touch points provide powerful opportunities to convey authentic and impactful leadership related to safety performance. This personalized approach to safety improvement is yielding results.  During March, we had only 1 recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. This represents substantial progress toward our ultimate goal of 0 injuries, and I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to our Goal Zero journey.  On Slide 5, we highlight the recent publication of the fifth edition of our annual sustainability report. This year's report updates our progress to our goals that help in addressing climate change, ending plastic waste and supporting a thriving society. The cover graphic from the report highlights our focus on 2030 interim targets that track our progress toward longer-term goals. Last September, we accelerated these targets and set a goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. Our interim 2030 target is to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the area of circular plastics, our 2030 goal is to produce a meaningful share of our polymer production, 2 million tons per year from recycled and renewable based feedstocks.  And this year, we announced new targets supporting our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our goals are to achieve gender parity across our global senior leadership and increase the number of underrepresented groups in our U.S. senior leadership to reflect the general population within 10 years.  Please turn to Slide 6, where we highlight some of our recent collaborations to develop more sustainable products. First, we've collaborated with Nippon Paint to produce packaging for the Chinese market using LyondellBasell's mechanically recycled CirculenRecover polypropylene. The paint containers reuse post-consumer plastic waste and reduce reliance on fossil-based feedstocks. Next, we show an example of the polyethylene tubes that we developed with our customer, Albea for L'Occitane shower scrub. The caps and tubes are designed to be fully recyclable and made with LyondellBasell's CirculenRevive polymers that are produced from an advanced molecular recycling process using plastic waste. The redesigned tubes retain the iconic brand's look and feel while providing a new life for plastic waste and reducing consumption of fossil-based feedstocks.  Finally, we collaborated with several customers to develop clear polypropylene drink cups for McDonald's from our CirculenRenew polymers using renewable feedstocks produced by Neste from bio-based sources such as McDonald's used cooking oil. We also have a similar collaboration underway with CirculenRevive to make cups for Wendy's restaurants. Wendy's estimates that their couple will divert 10 million pounds of plastic waste from landfills over the first 2 years.  LyondellBasell's collaborations on sustainability extend both up and down the supply chain. In Houston, we helped form the Houston recycling collaboration to increase recycling rates and improve the availability of feedstock from plastic waste. And through our investment with closed loop partners, we have invested in material recovery facilities that support post-consumer plastic waste recycling in New York, New Jersey and Florida.  Also, we are making good progress in decarbonizing our electrical power consumption by eliminating coal at our Wesseling, Germany facility and establishing renewable power purchase agreements with partners. In addition, we are collaborating with several peers on the development of large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities for the Houston region that would help decarbonize our industry.  Notably, we want to acknowledge our decision to exit the refining business by the end of 2023. This was a difficult decision, but we determined that an exit is likely to provide the best outcome for the company. We will talk more about this decision later in this call. Nonetheless, on the sustainability front, the shutdown of the refinery is expected to reduce LyondellBasell's Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 15%. Our strategy is to both leverage LyondellBasell's proprietary technology and collaborate with capable partners to advance our progress on circular plastics and decarbonization initiatives.  Please turn to Slide 7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the first quarter, our business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA, similar to fourth quarter results. Despite volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, solid product demand supported margins for our products across most markets in Europe and the Americas. Supply disruptions triggered by the war in Ukraine and the COVID pandemic created headwinds during the quarter. While we remain watchful for signs of demand destruction from inflation, we have been largely successful in passing through higher energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products.  We expect the strict 0 COVID policies in China will continue to hinder growth and profitability in Asia during the second quarter.  At LyondellBasell, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand for transportation fuels as in-person activities resume and global travel recovers. We expect that favorable markets for transportation fuels will continue through next year.  Slide 8 depicts LyondellBasell's historical profitability. Over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. In today's strong market and with LyondellBasell's larger asset base, we delivered $9.7 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, nearly 45% above the prior cycle average.  LyondellBasell's earnings performance is clearly stepping up from prior business cycles. We are well positioned with a diversified portfolio and larger asset base with propylene oxide and oxyfuels growth underway to extend this performance into the next cycle.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin by extending the stepping-up theme to the substantial cash generation from our businesses.  In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward a new record of $8.6 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months. During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 88% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 23% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months. The LyondellBasell team is highly focused on extending our proven track record of efficient cash generation to provide prudent reinvestment in our company and generous returns for our shareholders.  Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. With $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities, we funded our dividends and capital investments for the first quarter while continuing to repurchase shares and building some cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders through our dividend and the repurchase of approximately 2.1 million shares. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $400 million in capital expenditures. This includes our new world-scale PO/TBA plant starting up later this year.  We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.9 billion of cash and available liquidity. With our total debt at 1.2x trailing EBITDA, our leverage ratios are below our targeted range of 1.5 to 2.5, and we see no need for further deleveraging at this time.  Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11. As Ken mentioned, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect solid demand for our products and improving market conditions, benefiting our I&D and APS segments, offset by higher feedstock costs that compressed margins in our O&P-Americas segment.  Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. First quarter 2022 EBITDA was $911 million, $351 million lower than the fourth quarter 2021. Olefin results decreased approximately $170 million compared to the fourth quarter with lower margins due to higher feedstock costs and lower pricing for propylene and butadiene coproducts. We completed planned cracker maintenance at our La Porte, Texas site that contributed to lower volumes and resulted in our North America crackers operating at a rate of 82% during the quarter. Polyolefins results decreased approximately $185 million during the first quarter due to compressed margins driven by lower product prices and higher monomer costs. Stable demand led to relatively comparable volumes despite ongoing logistics and raw material challenges.  In March, we achieved an increase in polyethylene contract prices to reverse fourth quarter trends of declining prices. We continue to see strong demand for our polymers as we head into the second quarter. We expect margin recovery as product prices rise reflect higher energy and feedstock costs and stronger summer demand tightens markets. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia International segment. Higher product prices and volumes offset rising cost in EAI markets, resulting in first quarter EBITDA of $188 million, $33 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $30 million. Olefins results increased about $25 million as margins improved driven by increased monomer prices that offset higher feedstock and energy cost. We operated our European crackers at a rate of 74% of capacity due to planned maintenance and feedstock supply disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $35 million compared to the prior quarter. Stable demand drove increased polyolefin price spreads and volumes despite higher energy and monomer cost. Historically low Asian polyolefin spreads and weaker volumes, driven by COVID-related lockdowns in China caused our joint venture equity income to decline by about $50 million. During the second quarter, we expect that volumes and integrated margins for the segment will be comparable to the first quarter as steady demand should support price increases and keep pace with increasing costs.  On April 13, we reached an agreement to sell our Australian polypropylene business to Veeva Energy. We expect a second quarter noncash asset impairment charge of approximately $70 million in the O&P EAI segment related to the sale of this business.  Last quarter, we provided guidance related to planned maintenance at our cracker in Berre, France. Due to additional work we now think this turnaround will impact second quarter EBITDA by about $50 million. As high inflation begins to trigger concerns about the potential for recession, it is instructive to review the resilience of polyethylene demand growth over the past 30 years.  In Slide 14, the chart depicts the strength of polyethylene demand relative to other markets through the last 4 U.S. recessions. As indicated by the turquoise line, PE demand is remarkably resilient and compounds at a fairly consistent rate of about 4%, meaningfully higher than typical GDP. Unlike U.S. housing and vehicle markets, PE demand is relatively inelastic and embedded in essential products for our modern lives. Polyethylene is a foundational building block for consumer staples with wide-ranging applications such as food packaging, daily hygiene supplies and health care products. And with a cost advantage from shale feedstocks, U.S. polyethylene production increasingly serves a global market. We expect these resilient growth trends will continue as more people in emerging markets gain purchasing power and increased consumption of these essential products for modern life.  Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Robust margin expansion in most businesses resulted in record first quarter EBITDA of $546 million, $294 million above the prior quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $95 million. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased $50 million as butane dial and other derivative margins expanded. Durable goods demand remained solid, resulting in comparable volumes for the quarter.  Intermediate chemicals results increased more than $30 million. Margins increased in most businesses, primarily styrene and acetyls driven by tight market supply. Volumes increased as a result of improved first quarter operations. Oxyfuels and related products results increased more than $125 million as margins improved on higher gasoline prices and moderation in the ratio of butane feedstock prices relative to crude oil. Prior to the pandemic, our oxyfuels business was a fairly reliable contributor to the profitability of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. With gasoline demand approaching pre-pandemic levels, we expect a return to typical performance for the oxyfuels business in 2022.  In the second quarter, we expect volumes to increase with seasonal strength in demand for durable goods from building and construction markets. Margins for oxyfuels and related products are expected to expand with typical seasonal reductions in butane feedstock costs and increased gasoline demand associated with summer travel. Planned maintenance at our butane dial facility in 1 of our 2 propylene oxide units located at our Channelview, Texas site is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million.  Over the past 2 weeks, we declared force majeure for several acetyl products due to equipment failure at our La Porte, Texas site. If we are successful in restarting acetyls production during May, we are currently estimating a second quarter EBITDA impact for the downtime of approximately $50 million.  Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Improving volumes from automotive production and higher margins resulted in first quarter EBITDA of $125 million, $101 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $55 million.  Compounding and solutions results increased $40 million. Volumes increased due to improved demand from automotive parts manufacturers relative to the fourth quarter. Margins increased through stronger product pricing and improving asset utilization, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Advanced results increased $10 million, driven by increased seasonal roofing demand for Catalloy and higher product prices. We expect results will be similar in the second quarter as automotive recovery continues to drive volumes while rising cost impact margins. The latest IHS production forecast predicts a 4% rise in 2022 global automotive builds and a 9% increase in 2023. Unfortunately, these reduced forecast delay a return to prior peak production levels until 2025.  Now please turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Our first quarter EBITDA was $148 million, a decrease of $2 million. Prior quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of approximately $50 million. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark expanded significantly to $30.82 per barrel, a $7.24 increase due to higher demand for gasoline and diesel partially offset by lower byproduct value. We operated the refinery at 95% of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput of 255,000 barrels per day. In April, Refining margins continue to expand with increasing demand for transportation fuels. We expect refining markets will remain favorable during the summer months.  Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. First quarter EBITDA was $103 million, $70 million lower than the prior quarter's record level. The results were driven by lower licensing revenue and higher catalyst volumes and margins. We expect that second quarter profitability for our technology business will be slightly higher than the first quarter based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue milestones. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Michael. As I mentioned earlier, last week, we announced our decision to exit the crude oil refining business no later than the end of 2023. While these decisions are never easy, operation of the refinery beyond next year would require significant capital investment. After thoroughly analyzing our options, we determined that exiting the business was the best path forward. Our intention is to safely operate the refinery at full range through the end of next year to meet strong market demand for transportation fuels. During that time, we will continue to consider potential transactions and alternatives for the site. As mentioned earlier, by exiting refining, LyondellBasell will make substantial progress in reducing the company's greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, the refinery is located on 700 acres in the center of one of the world's leading integrated petrochemical hubs. The site's unique location provides LyondellBasell with valuable options for future growth, including further development of our circular businesses. We recognize that this decision affects our employees, their families and the community. Our employees and contractors at the refinery have delivered outstanding performance in safety, reliability, cost improvement and profitability over the past several years. We sincerely thank them for their contributions, and we are committed to supporting our people through this transition.  Now let me summarize the first quarter and our outlook with Slide 19. With all of the turbulence in the global economy, LyondellBasell's first quarter results illustrate the benefits of our global business portfolio and how demand for our products is highly resilient. While Asia is suffering from weak markets and historically low margins, demand in Europe and the Americas remains remarkably strong and consistent. Improving margins in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment offset first quarter margin compression in our O&P-Americas business. We expect PE chain margins to improve with higher seasonal demand supporting polymer price increases. Also, increased demand for transportation fuels is driving a recovery from pandemic-related weakness in our oxyfuels and Refining businesses. As a result, we expect cash generation will remain strong at LyondellBasell. Just like our earnings, we are stepping up in our progress on sustainability. Today, we talked about a few of our collaborations with customers to develop circular and renewable products for meaningful applications. We are exiting refining and entering into agreements for the supply of renewable power that will drive significant progress on our path toward decarbonization. And we are raising our targets and expanding on our disclosures in our latest sustainability report.  We remain committed to prudent capital allocation. With robust cash generation, we plan to continue rewarding shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. We are consistent in our commitment to an investment-grade balance sheet and remain highly disciplined in our consideration of organic and inorganic growth investments.  The coming months are exciting times for LyondellBasell. Our businesses are generating resilient results despite volatile economic conditions. We are laying the groundwork for new, more sustainable business models that are likely to reshape value chains across our industry. And later this year, we will be starting up our new propylene oxide and oxyfuel assets during a period of robust margins and strong market demand.  Finally, on May 23, I look forward to welcoming our next CEO, Peter Vanacker, to lead LyondellBasell. I hope you share my enthusiasm about the future of our company under his leadership.  We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Unidentified Analyst : This is Kieran on for Chris. I was wondering if you could just touch a little bit more in terms of what operating rates you're expecting in O&P-Americas in 2Q and throughout the year and maybe how you see that supporting what have been announced price increases throughout the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year? Kenneth Lane : Thank you for your question. We are -- as we've said during the remarks, we are still very bullish on the demand outlook, especially in the Americas. So we see demand being very strong. We had a record sales month in the month of March for polyethylene in the Americas. And we see April actually looking to improve on that. So we're -- our outlook is that we'll continue to see operating rates, effective rates probably in the 90% or higher range. So that's going to be very supportive for the price increases that are in the market today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Polyethylene prices in China continue to fall. Maybe if you look at the month forward prices, maybe they're down $100 a ton to 13 30, something like that. What do you make of that, in that I would have thought that profitability was pretty poor even at higher prices, and there's been a movement upward in the other regions? And maybe you can also comment on the changing profitability of your Bora cracker. Kenneth Lane : Jeff, thank you for your question. I hope you're doing well. Yes. So China, definitely, we've been seeing headwinds there. A lot of that related still to the COVID lockdowns. As you can imagine, the demand profile in China is quite challenging today with the amount of lockdowns that we see. Also, that's going to have an impact on some of the supply chain situation that we've seen. So prices today have basically been moving pretty much with feedstock in China. And when you look across the industry there, you do see all of the crackers, all the operators of crackers, they are cutting back on rates. So even for us at the Bora joint venture, we've reduced rates, and we've got a first quartile asset. So we do expect that in the coming months, what's going to happen is you're going to see a reset around inventory. Inventories are not high in China by any means, and you're going to see the inventory come down. And then I expect you're going to see demand come back. That reopening impact is still to come in China. And so while yes, in the short term, we're seeing some challenges around profitability with the cracker assets in China. As I look out in the next few months, I expect that's going to reverse and you're going to see a snapback in demand. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : I have a couple of questions about your Circulen products and perhaps about the Renew, which is derived from the renewable naphtha that you get from Neste. Do you see that as challenged longer term because that feedstock is -- can go into renewable diesel and get lots of credits and why not pursue kind of a carbohydrate path for that feedstocks such as ethanol-sourced ethylene? Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Steve, for your question. Yes. So we're very proud of the product portfolio that we're developing. As we've said before, we're looking forward to being a leader in the area of circularity and launch of our Circulen brand globally last year, you're beginning to see the fruits of that effort in the products that we've been developing together with customers today. In our portfolio, as we look forward, the CirculenRenew part of our portfolio will probably be the smaller segment for us. We are much more bullish on our ability to develop the advanced recycling and mechanical recycling parts of our business. Those really fit very well with our technical capabilities around developing new processes, but also the application development that we do together with our customers. So we will continue to look for opportunities to develop the CirculenRenew portfolio, where we see that and where customers are demanding lower CO2 footprint products, which is primarily why you want those CirculenRenew products. But remember, when you're doing recycling, people are driving recycled content. So there is a little bit of a different value proposition for those 2 products in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Bhavesh Lodaya : This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So in the I&D segment, clearly, very impressive results, especially in the first quarter. Now within the first quarter, a lot changed in March with the spike in crude. So could you describe or maybe break out the earnings seen in March versus the rest of the quarter? And then you mentioned that you expect oxyfuels earnings to return to more of a normalized earnings level this year. What would that new norm be? Kenneth Lane : Thanks, Bhavesh, for the question. Yes. Look, Intermediates & Derivatives really had a very strong quarter, record first quarter for that segment. We did see, as the quarter progressed, especially even relative to the fourth quarter, margins recovered, strong demand pretty much across the portfolio. We got a little bit of relief on butane and the feedstock in the feed slate there. So all of those things are going to be very constructive as we go into the second quarter. Demand for all of the product lines that we have are continuing to look very good, and margins are going to continue to be above average.  So as Michael said in the prepared comments, we do believe that we're going to get those businesses back to a more normal level, but I would expect that they're going to be above mid-cycle for the foreseeable future just because we have very strong demand. And even in some of those businesses, we're seeing pretty supportive supply-side impact as well. Some of our competitors in these markets are also having issues with production. So all of that is going to lead to, I think, a very strong performance for I&D in the second quarter Michael McMurray : And Ken, what I'd also add specifically around oxyfuels, if you look at the decade kind of before the pandemic, the oxyfuels business kind of consistently delivered $400 million plus of EBITDA. So a very consistent generator of earnings. Kenneth Lane : Great. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : I'm just curious about the decision in the quarter to build cash. It looks like $300 million of cash build versus $200 million of stock buybacks. Is there any particular thought behind that? Kenneth Lane : So listen, thanks for your question, Vincent. We're absolutely committed to continuing to be very disciplined around our capital allocation. And, of course, returning excess cash to our shareholders is going to be a priority. Michael, maybe you can just comment a little bit on that. Michael McMurray : Yes. I mean, listen, I mean I'd say a couple of things. I mean, one, I think we've established a track record and a reputation of converting EBITDA into free cash flow. No need to further delever, and the balance sheet is in great shape. Our growth investments are paying dividends. Working capital this year should be flattish versus last year consumed almost $600 million. CapEx year-on-year is going to be flat. We'll grow the dividend. And then we're going to return a meaningful amount of cash to our shareholders. There's no message in the first quarter that we built a little bit of cash on [indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Ken, a question around natural gas and ethane supply and the current sort of pricing moves that we've seen. I mean, it just seems that there are a bunch of cross currents, right? Production levels seem to be rising, be it this year and beyond. But we're obviously also seeing a lot of LNG export opportunities popping up, right? I mean if my numbers serve me right, I mean we have approximately 14 LNG export terminal approved. So how should we think about the extreme near term as well as the longer-term natural gas and ethane side of things? Kenneth Lane : Thanks for the question. Listen, a lot of -- there's been a lot of talk about what's happening, especially around natural gas. And of course, ethane is going to be following that. It's -- there are very much short-term impacts that are driving natural gas higher. If you look at just the energy complex, the alternative with coal is very high. So you don't see the switching, although production for natural gas is coming up. So normally, this time of year, we would see a bigger drop-off in natural gas pricing.  I think that's delayed just a little bit because of a couple of things. You've got colder weather in the northern part of the United States. So demand is continuing to be high -- the higher coal prices. Of course, we still are maxed out on LNG exports. Until the inventories get refilled in Europe and in the U.S., which I think will be sometime in kind of mid- to late summer, I think you're going to see a lot of volatility and elevated prices for natural gas, but I do expect it to come back into a more normal level sometime in the back end of the summer.  Now longer term, these export facilities take a long time to develop and build. So while those things are being constructed, I think what you're going to see, and we're seeing it even currently is that the production rates are going to accelerate. So you're going to see more production of the natural gas coming on, more production of oil coming on. Both of those, I think, production are up about 10% for both oil and gas since a year ago. All of that is going to be supported by generating more NGLs in the marketplace. So we still believe that longer term, the United States or the American position around ethane advantage is going to continue to be very durable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Prashant Juvekar : Yes. Ken, some people believe that integrated polyethylene margins in the U.S. are depressed somewhat because we can't export as much and given that there's logistical issues. Do you agree with that assessment? How does China COVID play into that? And have you seen any export sort of improving over the last few months? Kenneth Lane : P.J., thanks for your question. Look, no doubt we've talked about the headwinds around the supply chain and of course, there have been some constraints in rail movements in the U.S. and being able to move volume offshore even since the fourth quarter. That's not anything new. So I think I may have commented on this at the fourth quarter earnings call. That volume is already sold. So it's really not weighing on -- it's not like we can sell that twice.  We are really focused on watching the demand trends. The demand continues to be very supportive. We have been successful in being able to manage our shipments of products offshore to really minimize any impact to our sales. And I mentioned just a few minutes ago that we had a record sales month in the month of March, and we continue to see that being very robust. So what I expect to see is pricing in polyethylene in the U.S. started to turn back up and increase in the first quarter. That's going to continue as we go into the second quarter with higher demand, and I expect that we'll see some change some chain margin recovery in Q2. David Kinney : And P.J., this is Dave. I would just chime in that in March, we did see an increase in exports. It's up to nearly 40% of production in the month of March. And so we think that trend will continue into April once we get the numbers back. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Nice start to the year. There's a lot of new capacity in China is supposed to come on stream for polyethylene. Given what you've mentioned in terms of pricing and sort of the profitability over there, do you think that those projects will come on stream, be delayed, maybe in some of you getting canceled? Any thoughts there? Kenneth Lane : Yes, we've talked about this before. I do believe that, that is going to slow down some of these start-ups, and it's also going to slow down some of the decisions, especially when you look at the whole energy policy that's developing in China, all of those things are going to work to slow the development of the new capacity coming online there. But let's not forget, China is still a very big importer of polyethylene. And for us, what we're really focused on is watching the demand development. And as that demand returns and growth in China returns, it is going to absorb that new capacity. It's just a matter of when, it's not if. And so we're watching those trends and really focused on the demand side of the equation today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Joshua Spector : Wondering if you could talk a little bit about your view on polypropylene supply demand. And I mean our view is the spreads in that chain remain pretty elevated. So curious how you think about the sustainability of that over the coming quarter years, et cetera. And with the refinery shutdown in the future, how do you think about your internal propylene balance after that? Is that something that needs to be managed? Or do you have options to deal with that? Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Josh. Listen, the polypropylene, we're actually very bullish on. The supply-demand fundamentals there are very good, and that's even in the absence of a strong automotive market. We expect to see spreads increasing coming into the second quarter. We've already announced a spread increase for May. The market continues to be very tight. Inventories have been coming down. And I do think that there is room to go up in polypropylene. So we're feeling very good about our position with polypropylene. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Could you talk about your PO business? What percent of this business is on spot versus long-term contracts was pass-through with sort of semi-fixed margins? And how do you expect those margins to trend next year given the start-up of your PO project in the U.S.? Kenneth Lane : Thanks for the question, Aleksey. Listen, we -- propylene oxide is a core business for us, and it's one where we have a very strong position in. Margins have been improving in that business, especially in the Americas. And I expect now with some of the recent announcements around the supply side issues that we see in the industry, that's going to continue to be the case. Demand continues to be good, and it's perfect timing, frankly, for us to be starting up our PO/TBA plant later this year. We're extremely excited about getting that asset online and ramping up production and sales in the first half of next year. So overall, I don't think we could have really timed it any better. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Can you talk about the alternative uses that you're exploring for the refinery in terms of what those are and what might drive those decisions? Kenneth Lane : Kevin, thanks for your question. Listen, like we said, the refinery site is located in a very good positioned geographically on the ship channel, and it's got great pipeline connections with our cracker in Channelview. So there's a lot of kit there that we can look at that could be valuable in terms of if you think about circularity and some of the feedstocks that we would be using, a lot of those pyrolysis oil do need some hydrotreating and things like that. So they're fairly straightforward, but could be very synergistic with our circular ambition. So we're going to take the next several years to really study where we think that could go. And we think we can find some good value for that site in the mid- to long term to support our strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Ken, can you talk about Hyperzone? How is that plan progressing and the selling? And what the type of premiums, if any, you're getting on the Hyperzone product? Kenneth Lane : David, thanks for the question. So we had mentioned before that we had taken a shutdown in the fourth quarter to be able to make some repairs to that asset, and we've been continuing to work through that in the first quarter. So we are still not in a position yet to be, I would say, ratably selling the premium products from that asset. That's something that's going to build over the next 12 to 18 months. but the successful side of the equation there is that we've demonstrated the ability to make differential products that have differential product characteristics, and we have been able to get a premium on some of those, but it's frankly been very small volumes until now. So we view that as some of the upside that we're looking at. When we talk about stepping up, that's part of the upside that we're continuing to see in the next 12 to 18 months for the company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : This is Sean on for Steve. Just a quick check-in. In terms of the refinery, what might be the repurposing cost sort of facility if you choose to go in a different direction? And then also with an estimated $200 million in repurchases for this quarter, what might be some of the cadence moving forward for repurchases in light of the strong cash flow generation? Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Sean. I'll take the first question, and I'll let Michael take the second. So listen, it's way too early for us to be talking about any kind of repurposing costs around the refinery site. The focus for now is that we're going to operate that asset safely and reliably. Of course, we're going to keep a separate team that's going to be looking at some of the options for the future. But our priority right now is going to be really to stay focused on taking advantage of what we see in the marketplace today and really achieving a great result there and operating the assets safely.  So Michael, do you want to take the next question? Michael McMurray : Yes, sure. Thanks, Ken. While I probably won't give guidance on the level of share repurchase activity that we intend to execute to the balance of the year, what I can say is we expect to generate a lot of free cash flow. It's not our intention to build any meaningful cash balances on sheet. Therefore, the expectation is that you can expect that we're going to return copious amounts of free cash flow to our investors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : So yes, I guess a lot of questions have been asked around polyethylene. So maybe I'll ask a question on I&D and one on APS. So for I&D, I think peak earnings in the past, EBITDA has been around 2.1. Looks like you're headed to maybe the 1 6 level or so. And I think you mentioned that as a mid-cycle in the past. So is that still what you're thinking with the recovery in oxyfuels?  And then similarly with APS what's it going to take to get maybe to $800 million EBITDA level? Is that a more serious recovery in the automotive area? Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Arun. So yes, for I&A, I mentioned before, we are expecting to be above mid-cycle for that business. So I would say I would expect to be above the numbers that you're thinking about would be where we're at. For sure, we've got very strong tailwinds. And I had mentioned we had a record first quarter. So coming into the second quarter with demand even improving, we're very optimistic heading into the second half of the year or the second quarter going even into the second half of the year. Now for APS, one of the biggest things that we need to see there, we've been able to successfully maintain margins and continue to improve on margins. The volume equation is what's really going to be impactful for that business. So as automotive comes back and we're able to really refill that pipeline and get the demand side up, that's going to be what's going to drive our results. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Matthew Blair : I know you're selling -- or you're closing the refinery at the end of '23, but right now, refining margins are pretty phenomenal looking at $30 Gulf Coast cracks, $70 diesel cracks. How should we think about your margin capture potential in Q2? Are you going to be able to capture these pretty phenomenal numbers? Or is there a reason to be cautious on just overall margin capture? Kenneth Lane : Thanks, Matthew, for the question. Listen, for refining, yes, we're seeing very strong margins. The Maya 2-1-1 today is over $60, very strong diesel cracks, gasoline cracks strongest since 2015, inventories are low. So we're operating the assets very well, very high utilization rates. So to answer your question just very shortly, yes, we expect to be able to capture that margin uplift. Operator : Thank you. I am showing that there are no further questions. I will turn it back to Mr. Lane for closing comments. Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Alex, and thanks, again, everyone, for your questions and interest in our company. Before we close the call, I want to emphasize the excitement that's building here at LyondellBasell around our future. We are generating resilient results, and we're going to be welcoming our new CEO, Peter Vanacker, in May, and we have our world-class PO/TBA asset starting up later this year.  There is a lot to look forward to, and we're excited about what lies ahead. We hope you'll join us in July as we update you on our second quarter results, and I wish you all a great weekend. Please stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.  Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern time today until August 29 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13729909.  Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Torkel Rhenman, EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Jim Guilfoyle, EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions and Supply Chain. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook.  Before turning the call over to Peter, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, and impairments that we have discussed on past calls. LCM adjustments are related to our use of last in first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. Impairment charges were recognized to write down assets to their estimated fair value. Impairments include the noncash impairment of $69 million in the second quarter of 2022 that reflects the exit of our polypropylene business in Australia and the noncash impairment of $624 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and that reflects our evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery.  Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of impairments and LCM inventory adjustments. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2022 results. Let's begin with a short introduction of myself on Slide #3.  I'm very grateful to be here on my first earnings call since becoming CEO of LyondellBasell on May 23. I grew up in Belgium and undertook an education as a chemical engineer with a specialization in polymer engineering. During my more than 32 years in the chemical industry, I have had the pleasure of working with LyondellBasell as a customer, a supplier and a partner. During my time with Bayer, we invested in Lyondell's technology and assets while forming joint ventures for the production of propylene oxide. At Treofan, LyondellBasell was our largest polypropylene supplier. And at Neste, we partnered with LyondellBasell to achieve the world's first commercial production of polyethylene and polypropylene from Neste's sustainable bio-based feedstocks. Since joining the Board of Directors in February and then starting as CEO in May, I have been meeting extensively with stakeholders around the world to learn more about how LyondellBasell has been so successful in creating value.  More importantly, we have been asking ourselves how to best position the company to sustainably capture further value for years to come. I've always admired LyondellBasell's rich legacy of innovation and technology development. And I am pleased to confirm that our commitment and passion for safety and operational excellence or deeply embedded in our culture. These qualities will serve as well as work gets underway to advance our capabilities to capture latent value embedded within the company and establish LyondellBasell as a leader in serving the world's growing needs for circular and sustainable materials, while reducing our carbon footprint.  As Dave mentioned, additional members of our executive committee will join our earnings calls starting today. I believe that it is important for our investors to get to know our excellent leaders at LyondellBasell better. And I'm really impressed by this team, their market knowledge and leadership and their passion for safety and value creation.  Let's now turn to Slide #4 to discuss our excellent results during the second quarter. I am very happy with the outstanding work that LyondellBasell's leadership and employees have accomplished. This is a great way to start and gives me a lot of confidence for the future. Our businesses delivered strong earnings and cash generation during the second quarter and driven by record results from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment and strong refining margins. LyondellBasell's broad portfolio provided clear benefits as revenue grew sequentially by 13% while margins expanded to support a more than 20% improvement in EBITDA. Earnings were $5.19 per share and EBITDA was $2.5 billion, which resulted in $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, our company generated an impressive 24% return on invested capital over the last 12 months.  Let's turn to Slide #5 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership is outstanding and well known. As the CEO, I will make sure that safety remains a consistent and unwavering cornerstone of our company's culture. During my career, I have witnessed that companies that are leaders in safety are also best-in-class in reliability and productivity, and as a result, in value creation.  In 2022, the year-to-date total recordable incident rate for our global workforce improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This represents substantial progress towards our ultimate goal of zero injuries. I want to commend all of our employees and contractors for their clear commitments to goal zero. On Slide #6, we highlight some of our recent progress towards our sustainability goals. LyondellBasell's products, technologies and solutions provides very important contributions to a more sustainable world. In addition, we have committed to industry-leading sustainability targets that improve this value. Over the past few weeks, we signed 4 renewable power purchase agreements for 380 megawatts of electrical generation capacity in Texas. These wind and solar projects will be able to supply more than 10% of LyondellBasell's global electricity needs and represents meaningful progress towards the company's climate goal to procure a minimum of 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. These projects are expected to reduce the company's annual carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 370,000 tonnes and represents the average annual electricity needs from about 100,000 U.S. homes.  In addition to our renewable energy goals, LyondellBasell is growing our production of plastics utilizing renewable feedstocks under our CirculenRenew brands. Last year, we processed 12,000 tons of renewable feedstock in Europe, and we are forecasting to increase this number to 40,000 tonnes across both Europe and the United States during 2022. This material is being run through our existing ethylene cracker assets in Westling, Germany and Channelview, Texas with the goal to increase scale over the coming years since we see that the demand for these products is growing. The growth of renewable feedstocks is one part of our broader mission to expand the reach of our sustainable products, including those sold under the Circulen brands. Since launching our Circulen brands in 2019, we have sold over 140,000 tonnes of products based on recycled and renewable feedstock. This represents more than the amount of polyethylene and polypropylene consumed by the population of Houston in 1 year. LyondellBasell is doing more than simply talking about the circular economy. We are building real businesses that can help provide a more sustainable future for our customers and society. Please turn to Slide #7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the second quarter, our business portfolio delivered $2.5 billion of EBITDA, an improvement of $430 million compared to the prior quarter. LyondellBasell results reflect how our global business portfolio can serve changing consumer needs. As in-person activities resume and global travel recovers, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand. Strong North American demand and favorable naphtha costs supported margins for our products in the Americas and Europe, respectively, while higher ethane and energy costs as well as inflation created headwinds in these regions. We started to see moderating European demand due to high inflation at the end of the second quarter and continue to pass through elevated energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products where possible. During the quarter, China's zero COVID measures and logistics constraints continued to impact both regional and global markets. We expect progress in China will continue to be challenging over the next few months, but anticipate that demand will recover towards the end of 2022.  Let us turn to Slide #8 and review LyondellBasell's earnings power over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. From 2011 to 2019, our portfolio of businesses delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Favorable markets and our growing asset base delivered $9.2 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, an increase of nearly 40% over the prior cycle average. With the commissioning of our new propylene oxide capacity underway, we expect that LyondellBasell's stepped up earnings performance will provide resilience through the next business cycle. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin with describing how the step-up in our earnings is leading to increased cash generation from our business. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards $8.3 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months.  During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted over 90% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 26% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on extending our disciplined track record of capital allocation to provide for reinvestment in the company and generous returns for our shareholders. After generating $1.6 billion in cash from operations during the second quarter, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through a $5.20 per share special dividend, a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend that paid another $1.19 per share, all while repurchasing 45 million of our shares during the quarter.  We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with approximately $530 million in capital expenditures with a large portion funding our nearly completed world-scale PO/TBA plant. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11.  During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered nearly $2.5 billion of EBITDA. Our results reflect record profitability in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, driven by strong oxyfuels margins while our refining margins benefited from increased demand for transportation fuels. Conversely, margins in our O&P businesses encountered headwinds from rising costs for ethane feedstocks and moderating European demand.  One modeling item of note. Our original full year pension expense guidance of approximately $55 million did not include a second quarter $94 million noncash pension settlement charge that impacted earnings by $0.22 per share. As a result, our 2022 pension expense is expected to increase to approximately $180 million.  During the third quarter, we anticipate that we will begin recording costs related to our planned exit from our refining business at the end of 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Second quarter EBITDA was relatively flat at $905 million. North American demand for polyolefins continue to be very strong. Higher costs for ethane and energy pressured olefin margins and offset the benefits of improved polymer prices. During the third quarter, we expect continued strength in demand for polymers utilized in flexible packaging. But elevated costs for feedstocks and energy as well as continuing export supply chain constraints and market headwinds are likely to pressure margins.  Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher ethylene prices and relatively flat feedstock costs resulted in slightly higher second quarter EBITDA of $228 million. LyondellBasell's volumes declined due to downtime at our French cracker and moderating European demand for polymers in June. The extended maintenance in France resulted in an impact of $65 million to the segment during the second quarter.  During the third quarter, we expect seasonally slower summer demand and continued higher energy costs associated with tight gas supply, which will pressure European markets. Also, with China demand remaining sluggish due to zero COVID measures, the European market is also facing pricing pressure from dislocated Middle Eastern and Asian imports. Toward the end of this year, potential benefits from China's reopening could provide tailwinds for our businesses. With that, I'll turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Exceptional oxyfuel margins resulted in record second quarter segment EBITDA of $675 million. During the quarter, styrene results benefited from tight market supply. We are beginning to see that softer demand for durable goods is leading to moderation in propylene oxide margins.  In the third quarter, we expect margin compression across most product lines. Oxyfuel margins are also moderating but expected to remain elevated at levels well above historical averages. The steady success of our Intermediates and Derivatives segments is rooted in the Advantage Technologies, underpinning our propylene oxide business.  On Slide 15, let me highlight the cost advantages of LyondellBasell's propylene oxide production. The chart on the right depicts the global cost curve for producing propylene oxide by asset. The lower an asset is positioned on the curve, the greater the cost advantage. As you can see, LyondellBasell's assets that produce propylene oxide with a tertiary butyl alcohol co-product are on the lowest or most favorable part of the cost curve. PO/TBA assets represent roughly 15% of global capacity and derive their advantage from favorable costs for butane raw materials and strong pricing for the clean burning high-octane oxyfuel products produced from tertiary butyl alcohol. LyondellBasell's plants that produce propylene oxide with the styrene monomer co-products are the next lowest cost technology and represent 35% share of global capacity. Much of the industry produces propylene oxide using older, higher-cost technologies such as the chlorohydrin process. With the recent escalation in chlorine prices, the cost curve for chlorohydrin-based propylene oxide has only steepened, creating hardships for producers using this technology. LyondellBasell's advantage PO/TBA technology provides an excellent platform to address increasing global demand for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. Propylene oxide is used in the production of polyurethanes, first-time materials that saves energy by producing insulation and reducing weight in a wide range of applications.  Oxyfuels are clean-burning, high-oxygen gasoline blending components that increase fuel efficiencies and improves air quality by reducing harmful emissions. Let's continue with Slide 16 with an update on our PO/TBA project that we are completing here in Houston. This is the largest greenfield investment in LyondellBasell's history and will deliver much needed capacity to serve growing demand for these products that provide sustainable solutions for our planet.  We are thrilled to have nearly completed construction and we have already begun commissioning the oxyfuel assets, depicted in the photo on the right. The PO/TBA plant commissioning will begin during the fourth quarter, and we expect the integrated facility to start up in first quarter of 2023.  Our ramp-up during 2023 will not provide for full year of production but continued market strength is likely to support stronger margins than the mid-cycle economics depicted on this line. With LyondellBasell's sells advantaged technology and affordable shale advantage butane feedstocks are new capacity starting up with the support of favorable markets.  Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $418 million, with improved margins driven by increased demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. In the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread expanded significantly to about $56 per barrel. We operated the refinery at 94% of capacity with an average crude throughput of 252,000 barrels per day. In the near term, the Maya 2-1-1 spread is moderating from second quarter levels. We plan to run the refinery about 87% of capacity during the third quarter to perform a limited scope of planned maintenance. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim. James Guilfoyle : Thank you, Torkel. Now let's review the results from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Our Compounding and solutions business continued to be pressured by the slow recovery in automotive markets. In the first half of 2022, automotive production was 3% below the same period last year. Supply chain disruptions and raw material shortages continue to impact the recovery and therefore, our compounding and solutions business. Industrial construction markets have demonstrated strength as catalloy demand and margins supported higher advanced polymer results and a second quarter EBITDA for the segment of $118 million.  We expect similar results for the segment in the third quarter as the gradual recovery in automotive production improves volumes while rising costs impact margins. A more significant step-up in earnings will be dependent upon stronger automotive production and the resolution of raw material constraints. And with that, I will return the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you again, team, for this impressive quarter. The closeouts on our segments, let's turn to Slide #19, and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward, our Senior Vice President for R&D, Technology and Sustainability. I have always been highly impressed by the strength of LyondellBasell's international innovation and technology capabilities, the broad technology portfolio and our leading market position. Very clearly, innovation is a core part of LyondellBasell's DNA.  Second quarter EBITDA was $112 million, supported by strong licensing revenue and record year-to-date catalyst demand. While new licensing activities slowed we have noted a recent shift in our licensing demand away from commodity polymers. 4 of our 5 new licenses this year were sold in Asia to produce low-density polyethylene vinyl acetate copolymers used in solar panel laminations and encapsulants that support the world's rising demand for renewable energy.  In the third quarter, we expect our licensing revenue and catalyst volumes to moderate. This segment is likely to produce results similar to that seen in the first or second quarter of 2021. Now let me summarize the second quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide #20.  LyondellBasell's second quarter results benefited from a balanced portfolio that captured considerable value with very efficient cash conversion. Margin expansion in our oxyfuels and refining businesses and solid demand for our products more than offset higher feedstock and energy costs. Our management team and Board understands and respects the power of this portfolio. We are unwavering and our disciplined approach to capital allocation and demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns during the second quarter.  LyondellBasell is making measurable progress towards our ambitious interim and long-term goals for the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions while developing sustainable businesses based on recycled and renewable materials. Our aim is to build upon our initial work, scale or reach and establish LyondellBasell as a leader in serving the world's growing needs for circular and sustainable materials while reducing our carbon footprint.  I began my journey as CEO with a commitment to leverage LyondellBasell's strengths and capture value from both near-term and long-term opportunities. Over the past several months, we have undertaken an in-depth examination of our company to identify a north star that will provide clarity and guiding principles for our strategic decisions. including our progress on circularity and sustainability.  We are consulting with all stakeholders to ensure we have aligned on a durable and resilient strategy that will serve LyondellBasell well across a range of scenarios for many years. Last week, we had a very productive interim review with our board on this topic. We're planning further alignment during our Board meetings in the second half of the year with our work aimed towards communicating or our north star externally during an Investor Day in early 2023. In addition, the second work stream is underway to identify, prioritize and execute on value opportunities that exist in LyondellBasell's current business structure. Thus far,our work has identified a considerable number of opportunities such as creep capacity, debottlenecks, automation and energy saving opportunities that can be delivered through modest investments by leveraging LyondellBasell's existing strengths.  We believe the value of these projects is considerable and actionable. I am committed to communicating our initial assessment of this value opportunity and our time line for realization during our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to sharing our vision for LyondellBasell and the additional value we plan to unlock from our company. We are now pleased to take your questions. Thank you. Operator : . Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : Yes. I appreciate the Slide 15 on your outlook for PO. And Torkel, maybe you could comment on what do you think that slide or that chart would have looked like historically, clearly, now you have some reasons for it to be shaped like that with lower butane and higher benzene and certainly higher chlorine, but is part of this just because TVA is so valuable right now? And is the shape of this year outlook in the years to come? Is that part of your EBITDA forecast? Torkel Rhenman : So thank you for the question. I think as we looked at this, we've -- and if you compare it to historical averages, it's actually widened in terms of the differential in terms of our competitive advantage. And that's primarily driven right now the value of the core products. And of course, that will fluctuate over the cycle.  But fundamentally, we see for the next -- where we are right now and in the coming next 2 years, we are in a very favorable cycle situation. Then as you drive -- if you look at energy costs going up, that will also favor our technology. So I think fundamentally, where we are and look at it right now, I think our technology is very advantaged. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Joshua Spector : I wanted to ask on polypropylene in the U.S. It looks like spreads were pretty volatile during the quarter, maybe starting at around $0.20 a pound to start up near $0.50 in May and kind of round tripped back down. So I'm curious, one, is that similar to how your earnings progressed through the quarter?Two, what drove that volatility? And three, what's your outlook for the next couple of quarters in terms of the spreads. Peter Vanacker : Let me give that question, I mean, to you, Ken, you're close to that business, of course. Kenneth Lane : Sure. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Josh, for the question. Look, a lot of the volatility that you've seen in the polypropylene market this year has been related to a lot of downtime in the industry, particularly in the U.S. I think that a lot of that is behind us. Inventory levels are, frankly, in our favor in polypropylene.  So I'd say, looking forward, we mentioned some softening demand trends that we see around durable applications. We see that in the polypropylene area as well, but we still see very good demand in packaging. So net-net,we're going to see some softening, some headwinds in polypropylene, but continued spreads that are going to be above historic averages. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Could you talk a little bit about naphtha costs in Europe and in Asia, which during the quarter seem to disconnect from oil? So could you just sort of discuss what you see the outlook is there and what impact it will have on your European operations? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, Vincent. A very good question on naphta and especially what is happening in Europe and in China. As you noticed well, I mean, naphtha is decoupling at the moment from what is happening on the oil side. But I think one needs to look at China and when demand will pick up substantially again in China, and that eventually would reestablish, in our opinion, the relationship between naphtha and crude oil.  Giving a little bit of further information, I mean, around China, then we have seen a little bit already or an uptick in demand in China, but it was very modest during the second quarter. We expect that, especially after October, there will be quite some incentives coming out as it has been in the past. So towards the end of the year, beginning of next year, one may expect that demand in China would substantially pick up and be back on normal levels of growth that we have seen over the cycle. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Congrats, Peter, on a very solid first quarter as CEO. May you have many more. If I could follow up on Europe and energy. How do you see the situation playing out if there is a material natural gas shortage, what would be the impact on Lyondell? What are the actions that you're taking to -- that you would take to possibly mitigate that? Peter Vanacker : Frank, let me also say, I mean,  Yes. Of course, I mean, it's in the current situation in Europe. We are very close in to what is happening there. That's what you may expect, of course, in such a situation that we have an internal crisis management team up and running that we are developing different business continuity plans that we have analyzed I mean our dependency also on nat gas.  And I must say, I mean, that the integrated crackers that we have, they show a low dependency on nat gas, mostly supplied by oil-based fuels. I want to put it in perspective as where the biggest impact is eventually is in Germany and Italy, but German revenues for us are based upon last year's revenue, about 7% of total revenue and Italy is about 4% of total revenue. We believe that we can continue to run our crackers in Europe, but we have been doing at an 85-plus percent range. So from that perspective, believe that we -- if everything runs, let's say, in a normal way, we would be quite robust in continuing our operations independent of the fact the effective North Stream One returns, so back to 40% or would be lower than the 40%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Bhavesh Lodaya : Peter, this is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Across the press release and your presentation, you highlighted the impact from lockdowns in China and a potential reversal towards the end of the year. Can you add some color around the profitability of your Chinese operations and your peers in the region?  And then assuming we are in this, say, higher for longer crude price environment, what is the market appetite for higher prices, which is probably required to get to your historical margins there? Peter Vanacker : Let me take them in the first question, John. It's clear, I mean that China operations, I mean, profitability at this point in time is low. But due to the fact, I mean, with our investments that we made in China that we are in the first quartile in terms of delivered costs, cash costs. So we have a favorable position in China. But generally spoken, I mean, the profitability is very low. Having said that, also, again, I'd like to put it into perspective. I mean, China for us in terms of revenues or total revenues is let's say, a bit lower than 5%. So I don't want to overemphasize that either. Then on your second question can I give that to you, Ken? Kenneth Lane : Sure. Absolutely. So look, what we see happening in China in particular, is prices are going to move where feedstock go at this point. People are cutting back utilization. A lot of the assets are, frankly, underwater, and you're making a decision almost daily about whether to continue to operate or is it better to shut down. So that's putting a floor under pricing today. So from my perspective, there's nowhere to go but up in China these days. There will be a reopening impact. The question is always going to be about when, not if. But like Peter said, we've got very good new assets, both in O&P and I&D. So we're still confident in the outlook beyond the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : A question for Ken perhaps. I was wondering if you could comment on the U.S. propylene market. It seems to have gotten a bit sloppy here in recent months. I believe the U.S. July contract price declined another $0.04 earlier this week, and it makes 4 consecutive monthly declines of 35% negative or so. Can you comment on both sides, supply/demand, what you're seeing there and whether we might expect that pattern to reverse in coming months? Kenneth Lane : Sure, Kevin. Thank you for the question. Yes, I do see -- expect to see that trend in propylene reverse in the U.S. In fact, I would -- I think we're going to see that in August already. We're starting to see spot prices move up again for propylene. And I'll go back to the answer that I gave earlier. There's been a lot of downtime for polypropylene assets in the U.S., and that's put some link into the propylene market.  What's happening now is you're starting to see those assets run again, and you're going to start to see people refilling inventory levels because of all the downtime that we've had with polypropylene and that's going to start to bring the propylene price back up a little bit here in the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Michael Leithead : I think industry consultants are forecasting, I don't know, about $0.15 to $0.20 a pound decline in U.S. polyethylene prices between now and the first quarter. I guess, do you agree with that assessment? And why or why not? Peter Vanacker : Well, I'll take that, and then Ken will also further elaborate on your question, Mike. I mean what we continue to see is very good demand, I mean, in the marketplace. And yes, maybe a little bit of slowdown like we alluded to in terms of durable goods. But then there are a couple of other points that I want to highlight here as well is, if you look in Europe and in North America at the average inventory in terms of car builds, then we are today, substantially below -- actually at the lowest level since the last 5 years.  And that has not been -- if you look at what the automotive industry has been saying in their quarterly calls, it's not because they have a lack of demand, but it's mainly still because of the supply chain, and they are expecting that towards the end of the year a lot of these issues will be resolved. So the key question there will be, how will that actually then result in restoring inventory levels in that particular industry as 1 data point.  The other data point is definitely also with regards to the more the feedstock costs and feedstock costs have been exceptionally high, I would describe them, I mean, during Q2. But if we look at natural gas towards the end of the year and eventually also the impact on ethane prices, we tend to believe, I mean that, that should moderate, I mean, during the second half of 2022.And as a result and also have its impact on the margins. Ken, do you want to elaborate a little bit further on this? Kenneth Lane : Yes. I guess the one thing that I'll add is when we look at this, we've got a lot of levers that we pull here in terms of managing our margins. We do expect to see energy and feedstock costs continue to be elevated in the back half of the year, but they're going to moderate versus the second quarter.  There will be things that we're doing around our feed slate, our product slate, our channel selection market segments because we still do, to Peter's point, see strength in some of our market segments. And we'll be gearing our portfolio to serve that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Nice quarter. I think as you guys know, polyethylene demand was fairly resilient during the pandemic, up 2% in 2020. And so just curious, what you think demand would be for polyethylene if we are or going into a recession as we head into '23? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thanks for your comment, Michael, on the second quarter. Highly appreciated. Definitely, I mean, on -- in terms of PE demand, Ken has shown -- I think it was in the previous quarter, also how resilient I mean, PE demand is actually even if you talk about downturns in the industry, if you call them recession or not. And this is something that we continue to see as well. I mean moving forward that we expect that PE demand will continue to be resilient in the next quarters. Ken, do you agree? Kenneth Lane : I absolutely agree. I think what we've seen in the past is that polyethylene is typically recession-resistant. And even this year, with China being down, we still expect to see growth in the kind of 2% to 3% range globally. So -- as China comes back, I think you're going to see that growth number go up even higher, which is what we've seen historically. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Prashant Juvekar : Peter, a question on refining. You announced the refinery shutdown way before the actual shutdown? And if refining margins continue to remain high, would you be able to delay the refinery shutdown by putting in some incremental maintenance capital? Peter Vanacker : Well, P.J., thank you for your question. We've been very clear. I mean, the latest, I mean, by the end of we will shut down our refinery in Houston. Nothing has changed in that regard. It's simply because of the technical reasons. -- you need to eventually invest a huge amount of money to keep the refinery operating. And definitely, as I alluded to in my preliminary comments, safety has always been -- the most important thing that we are looking at in the company. So we will not, at the expense of safety, keep operating, I mean, the refinery, which means as a consequence, one would have to invest a huge amount of money. We've alluded to that above $1 billion, at least.  My experience is actually telling me that the moment you open up or react on, you willstart finding out that actually your $1 billion will not be sufficient, and it's going to be substantially higher in terms of the investments in the refinery. So nothing has changed towards what we have communicated before. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : If I could also follow up on the refinery issues.It's a multipart question. Are you in active negotiations to still sell the refinery? Or are you not in negotiations? Second, if you thought the return on capital was adequate, would you close it anyway because of your carbon reduction targets? Or how do you weigh the carbon reduction targets versus the return on capital? And thirdly, are you continually reassessing the return on capital based on your assessment of refining margins? Or have you already simply made the decision to exit? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, Jeff. I mean, for your very good questions. And let me go a little bit deeper. And what actually is the attention that we are having with regard I mean to the refinery, what are we actually looking at? I mean with the refinery I mean it's a very nice location that we have. We have very good assets also at the refinery.  So we're mainly looking at the fact, can we do -- what can we do else, I mean, with the assets that we have at the refinery? You're very familiar with the fact that we are making very good progress on our molecular recycling technology. So the advanced recycling technology development. And this site could be a very good fit for us to do very large investments. Nothing has been decided yet. As said, this is investigation, but we -- the more we look at it, I mean, the more we are inspired coming by it because we have very good equipment that we eventually could then use. So there could be quite a lot of synergies. So this is the direction of travel, Jeff, with regards, I mean, to the refinery. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Just given all the moving parts and spread compression across the intermediate and segment, -- can you just give the intermediate-term outlook in terms of spreads of the various businesses in there, including Oxyfuels, just to give us help us a little bit more perspective heading into 2023? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, Chris. I mean, let me first, I mean, again, make a couple of comments on that. When -- of course, I know LyondellBasell for quite a while, that's clear. But also when I started moving into my position,then what impressed me a lot is the diversity of the different products and solutions that we have in the portfolio. And as such, I call it a kind of a natural hedge because -- all the products are not following the same cycle and therefore, are hedging each other. So that is quite good, I mean, to have a portfolio like that.  And the best demonstration was, of course, on our earnings, I mean, during the second quarter as a result out of that. Now if we go a little bit deeper, I mean, we've talked a lot already about polyethylene and polypropylene and margins and so on. So I would put the focus maybe a little bit on the very important oxyfuels business that we have and the contribution of oxyfuels as an octane enhancer as you know. And then also with regards to positioning in terms of sustainability solution offerings. So Torkel if you can give a little bit of an update on the oxyfuels, what you see. Torkel Rhenman : Yes. No, thank you. So even instead of I&D, what we have through the portfolio, it's a very resilient portfolio in terms of over a cycle that they don't all follow the same cycle. And the oxyfuels is a really good example of that, where we see maybe the gasoline cracks moderatingbut the oxyfuels margins are expected to stay well above the historical averages. And it's the multitude of things that drives the margins there. It's also the advantaged butane cost that we see helping us looking forward, but then also the very strong demand for octane and that basically drives the premium of our oxyfuels above gasoline.  And that's also been a very strong factor for the excellent results, the record earnings that we had for Oxyfuels, and we think will remain at an elevated level? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John Roberts : In the presentation, you talked about continued strength in propylene oxide, but I think the release discussed some slowing in polyurethane markets, which I guess we'd expect with auto and appliances and construction. As you begin commissioning the new PO plant, do you plan to take downtime in other plants to kind of keep the market balanced if we are facing a slowdown there? Torkel Rhenman : As part of our start-up plan,we have other outages scheduled for other plants that we have delayed, so in terms of managing our supply on the PO. But we also expect that the plan to ramp up during the year. And we expect that for next year, we will produce about 50% of the annualized capacity from the plant. Peter Vanacker : John I mean start-up is scheduled, I mean, towards the end of Q1 2023. And as said, I mean, by Torkel, you gradually move into the name paid capacity volumes. So therefore, if you average it out over the year 2023, then it would be approximately we expect, I mean, 50% of the nameplate capacity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : I just wanted to touch on O&P-EAI. In the press release, you guys, I believe, said that around 30% of the sort of feedstock slate out there was non-naphtha-based. So I just wanted to get a better sense of how we should think about the feedstock flexibility you have in your European operations. Are you sort of hitting the upper limit when you say that 30% was non-naptha? Peter Vanacker : Ken? Kenneth Lane : I would not say we're hitting the upper limit. There are a lot of things that we can still do on the feed slate. As you know, naphtha has been favored. A lot of that is driven by not only the naphtha price, but also the co-product pricing. So that is a big lever for us, not only in Europe but also in U.S. markets, and we'll continue to find opportunities around the feed slate and optimize the portfolio as we go. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. I just wanted to drill down a little bit into O&P-Americas profitability. If you look ahead, I guess, into Q3 and the back half, we potentially have some slowing demand high consumer retail inventories and continued high feedstock. Do you expect the continued high feedstock slate to resist and I guess, support pricing? Or is the demand waiting to the that maybe we see some margin deterioration as we go through the next couple of quarters? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thanks, Arun. Let me take the first part of your question, then I will ask Ken, I mean, to further elaborate. You alluded already a bit to it. I mean in terms of demand, we continue to see, I mean, demand to be healthy. And of course, I mean, with our portfolio of products that we have, we can shift, I mean, more, I mean, to the consumer driven products packaging because as I said before, we expect that packaging will continue to be quite healthy, something that we have seen, I mean, in the past also in downturn period of the economy or recessions. With regards, I mean, to the feedstocks, we said, I mean, pressure will continue to be high on the feedstock and on the energy cost level. Towards the end of the year, we expect a little bit of moderation, but still, I mean, the pressure will continue to be high. Ken? Kenneth Lane : Yes. I think the only thing that I'll add to that is you do have new supply coming on, and that's going to be another headwind for us. But the good news is that we'll start to see some of these supply chain constraints unwind at the back end of the year, and that's going to help open up some channels to market. We also -- you had mentioned inventory levels. We're already seeing downstream consumers start to reduce inventory levels. So that -- that's actually already started taking place.  And I think one thing we're going to watch very closely, obviously, is going to be what's happening with the weather impacts on that becausethere is a sort of a natural tendency in this industry to start to pull the inventories down, and this is not necessarily a great time of year to do that. But of course, we'll be watching that closely and see how those things develop. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : This is Kishan on for Steve. Just a question on IND. I'm just curious, I was wondering if Scope 3 emission standards would disadvantage the business long term? And then also with MTD prices normalizing, what might baseline earnings potential for I&D look like? Peter Vanacker : Well, good question. I mean, in the I&D business, I mean, Scope 3 emission standards. It's clear, of course, also that even if we have not clearly made a commitment on Scope 3, that we are deeply analyzing what are the emissions on Scope 3 that we have, we are approaching, of course, also our customers in discussions in reducing their Scope 3 emissions on the products that they are supplying to us. So that's work in progress.  But it is important, I mean, we are looking at it. And I'll give you one example. I mean we talked about the refinery beforehand. By shutting down the refinery, we're talking about approximately 40% of our global Scope 3 footprint that would be reduced. So we're talking here about 30 million, 40 million tonnes per year of scope 3 emissions that would be reduced just by that action. Talking about the applications, not necessarily at this point in time, we see a disadvantage because it is a -- Scope 3 is something that is extremely difficult, I mean, for the entire industry, I mean, to deal with. There is no clear accounting mechanism I mean for Scope 3. So lots of things that need to still be worked out, I mean, through legislation and how to account, I mean, for Scope 3 emissions. So immediate answer to that is we don't see that in terms of demand for those products that, that would have an impact, I would say, on the contrary, because the oxyfuels, if you talk about top fuels actually make a good contribution in that regard. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Peter, you mentioned strength in styrene in the quarter, but it is expected to weaken going forward. What's your outlook for styrene in the intermediate and longer term for you guys? Peter Vanacker : Give that question into Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Yes. Thank you. I think second quarter was driven by both strong demand but also primarily operational issues, scheduled and unscheduled outages, and we see margins probably softening here in third quarter and the second half of the year. And I think that there are growth areas, but there are also areas under pressure. Single-use plastics, of course, being one under pressure, but you also have strong and we've seen double-digit growth for EPS being used in insulation material -- so I would say that we probably have a moderate outlook in terms of margins in the immediate term. Operator : I am showing that there are no further questions. I will turn it back to Mr. Vanacker for closing comments. Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you very much, I mean, for all the very thoughtful questions. I would say, as usual. And we look, of course, forward to sharing more of our plans with you about how we outlined of Brazil with advance on our strategy. And in addition to that, we also unlock additional value over the coming months. As said, you may expect when we are releasing our third quarter results that we are putting a number to the additional value that we believe we can capture and also a time line to that. And then invite you for the beginning of next year to a Capital Markets Day to talk about our strategy.  I wish you all a great weekend, and of course, stay healthy and stay safe. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

Following today\u2019s presentation we will conduct the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, Melissa. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documentation on our investor website provides reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, in our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern time today until November 28 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States; and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13732141. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Tim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Reman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter 2022 results. Let's begin with our safety results on Slide number 3. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety performance in 2022. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.12, roughly half the rate seen in recent years. Safety is a core value at our company and will continue to receive the utmost attention. The focus and commitment our metrics reflect will remain a cornerstone of our company's culture and a key enabler of our future success. Let's now turn to Slide number 4 to discuss our financial results. During the third quarter, as you would expect, our team remains very focused on cash generation while navigating the well-known, very challenging environment. LyondellBasell's business portfolio faced headwinds from rising costs and weaker demand at the same time. Earnings were $1.96 per share. EBITDA was $1.2 billion. Nonetheless, we delivered an impressive $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities. By the end of the quarter, we increased our balance of cash and short-term investments to $1.5 billion and had $5.3 billion of total available liquidity. The strength of our balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enables us to confidently move forward with our strategy while continuing to provide attractive and strong returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle. Despite significant headwinds our company generated a 19% return on invested capital over the past 12 months. On Slide number 5, we highlight some of LyondellBasell's existing and emerging sources of advantage for generating differential value and high returns over a range of market conditions. Our company is widely recognized for our deep commitment to safe operations, cost management and operational excellence. These values are part of our DNA. LyondellBasell's global portfolio of businesses benefit from both geographic and end market diversity, leading positions in the diverse markets, balance the portfolio and reduce risks from market concentration. Last quarter, I mentioned the work that is underway to identify a north star that provides clarity and guiding principles for our strategic decisions. Some of the early decisions from this work adds to our capability and resiliency for generating value and high returns. Market leadership in circular and low-carbon solutions has quickly emerged as an essential parts of our path forward. We believe circular and low-carbon solutions will provide advantage under a wide range of economic scenarios. We will talk about this more in a few moments. An intense and consistent focus on people and culture is a key enabler for driving differential value. On October 1, we implemented a new organizational structure that will improve agility and accountability across our company. One example is our decision to align strategy and execution by moving the global responsibility for manufacturing under the strategic business unit leaders. The strategic business unit leaders will have the ability to run their businesses based upon the required value propositions and business models. We also launched customer and commercial excellence initiatives to elevate our levels of service, quality and innovation. With the right organizational structure and improved customer focus, our company will have even more capacity to capture differential value. After a very comprehensive diagnostic phase, a well-structured value enhancement program targeting $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvements have been launched. I will describe this program in more detail shortly. When these portfolio advantages are combined with our track record of efficient cash conversion, our investment-grade balance sheet and our secure steadily growing dividend, I think you will agree that LyondellBasell has the winning formula for generating high returns and differential value for our investors under a wide range of economic scenarios. On Slide number 6, I would like to share more detail on one of the decisions that quickly emerged from our strategy work, the creation of our new circular and low-carbon solutions business unit. In my view, circular and renewable solutions businesses require a differentiated business model and a more entrepreneurial mindset to succeed. We're setting up our new circular and low-carbon solutions business unit with this in mind. This business unit is led by Yvonne van der Lann and is accountable for building scalable technologies and profitable businesses to serve rapidly growing customer demand for our circular and low-carbon solutions. Since we launched the Circulen brands in 2019, we've sold products with more than 150,000 tons of recycled and renewable content. Our current goal is to sell at least 2 million tons per year of these products by 2030, with our new business unit leading the way. For perspective, 2 million tons represents about 20% of our 2021 global sales of polyethylene and polypropylene. In just the past few weeks, we have announced our participation in several agreements related to new capacity for our circular and low-carbon solutions business in several regions. We are partnering on plastic waste sorting facilities in Houston and Germany. The sorting plants will convert longer plastic waste into usable feedstocks for mechanical and or advanced recycling. In Germany, we expect the facility will provide a material amount of the feedstock required for our first advanced recycling plants using LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec Technology. In India, we are forming a joint venture for a fully automated 50,000 tons per year mechanical recycling facility. And in China, we are developing another joint venture to mechanically recycle post-consumer waste in the Guangdong Province. I am confident that these and future actions will accelerate our circular and low-carbon solutions offering to position LyondellBasell as the preferred supplier for customers and brand owners seeking to lower the greenhouse gas impact of their business and increasing the circular content of their products. Our recently announced collaboration with Air Liquide, Chevron and Uniper on a U.S. Gulf Coast low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project is but one additional example of our progress. We're quickly and methodically building a robust supply chain to support attractive growth opportunities for our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Let's turn to Slide number 7 and discuss the launch of our value enhancement program. LyondellBasell has a well-earned reputation as a cost leader in our industry. But after 12 years with a singular focus on managing costs, a significant number of untapped value opportunities have accumulated. We believe this untapped value can be unlocked with modest incremental investments in resources. Our value enhancement program utilizes a proven stage gate methodology to identify, implement and track progress on hundreds of initiatives across the company. Over 2,000 IDs have been generated, and we have validated more than 1,500 initiatives to date. But we're just getting started. We organized value opportunities into three categories : manufacturing and operational excellence, procurement and supply chain and commercial excellence. We have confidence that our value enhancement program is capable of achieving an estimated $750 million of annual recurring EBITDA improvement by the end of 2025. And with the continuous evergreen process in place, we look forward to regularly extending our goals. We will keep you apprised of our progress and look forward to sharing more details on this program during our upcoming Capital Markets Day in March. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to describe the new organizational responsibilities for the business leaders on this call. Joining us on the call today is Kim Foley, who assumed responsibility for the Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining segments from Torkel Rhenman. Kim began her career with our company more than 30 years ago as a chemical engineer and has served in a broad range of leadership roles, spanning manufacturing, strategic planning, finance and supply chain. She is a proven leader with a deep knowledge of our company and value voice on our Executive Committee. Torkel Rhenman is now in charge of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In order to be a market leader, our APS business requires a customer service focus that is differential for most of LyondellBasell's other businesses. Torkel will develop the appropriate culture and service model to maximize the full value potential of our APS business. Torkel\u2019s prior experience as a CEO at other companies will serve us well in this role. Ken Lane will continue to have responsibility for our two olefins and polyolefins segments. And Jim Guilfoyle, who formally led APS is relocating to Rotterdam and reporting to Ken as the leader for the O&P business in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of robust cash generation. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards a total of $7.6 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash on hand increased to $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the past four quarters, our team efficiently converted 100% of EBITDA into cash. This efficient and robust cash generation provided for the return of $4 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the third quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $400 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and an additional $160 million through share repurchases. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $440 million in capital expenditures, a significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction for our world-scale PO/TBA plant that remains on track for start-up in the first quarter 2023. My finance and strategy teams are partnering with our strategic business unit leaders to rigorously track the ongoing progress from our value enhancement program. We look forward to regular reporting on our value capture beginning in 2023. Now, I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Our results reflect margin compression across all segments due to rising costs and weaker global demand. Our olefins and polyolefins businesses faced persistently high and volatile energy cost, coupled with lower demand, particularly in Europe and China. While our oxyfuel business and refining segment continue to earn margins above historical averages and demand for fuels remained strong, results were sequentially lower following peak margins in the second quarter of 2022. Higher cost for energy, raw materials, labor and transportation negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Across our European assets, September year-to-date energy costs are $1.8 billion higher than the same period in 2020. During the quarter, we recognized $84 million in cost related to the exit from our refining business. We expect to incur a similar amount for refining exit costs during each of the next five quarters. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Americas segment. Third quarter O&P Americas EBITDA decreased to $559 million. In North America, the combination of customer destocking and expectations of additional supply from new assets resulted in lower product prices. During the fourth quarter, we expect lower seasonal demand and further capacity additions will keep markets well supplied. Margin pressures could be offset by moderating feedstocks and energy costs. Also, with lower demand, we expect continued easing of logistical constraints. LyondellBasell will continue to reduce operating rates to match lower demand and manage our inventories. We expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at a rate of approximately 75% in the fourth quarter. While market conditions remain challenging, we continue to proactively advance our long-term strategy. We recently announced a new partnership with Cyclyx and ExxonMobil to build a 150,000-ton plastic waste sorting facility in Houston. Beyond recycling, we announced our participation in an industry consortium to evaluate a low-carbon hydrogen production facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast. We are moving quickly and decisively to increase circularity and reduce our carbon footprint. Now please turn to Slide 12 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. European markets were severely pressured by tight gas supplies and higher energy costs that reduced demand from both plastic converters and downstream consumers. LyondellBasell's European volumes declined due to extended downtime at our ethylene cracker in France, and planned maintenance at our cracker in Germany. All of this combined to result in a third quarter EBITDA loss of $83 million. During the fourth quarter, we expect high and volatile energy costs will persist. In addition, slower seasonal demand is likely to add further pressure on European markets. Our O&P Europe businesses have responded to escalating energy prices by reflecting these costs and product pricing with energy surcharges. This year, we introduced variable formulas for these surcharges to account for energy volatility and ensure fairness in our pricing. Also, in response to lower demand and margins, we plan to operate our European assets at approximately 60% of capacity during the fourth quarter. As previously announced, we have postponed the restart of our integrated O&P site in France until early 2023. As in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies in support of our circular and low-carbon business. In October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China and a fully automated mechanical recycling facility in India. These partnerships allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose facilities in each region, while addressing rapidly rising global demand for circular and renewable solutions. Finally, I want to express how excited I am about the opportunities with the value enhancement program that Peter mentioned. Across the board, we see ideas being generated to improve value capture in manufacturing, procurement and serving our customers more efficiently. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim Foley : Thank you, Ken, and thank you, Peter, for your kind remarks at the beginning of the call. Please turn to Slide 13 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Following a record second quarter, EBITDA for the segment declined to the third quarter of $360 million. Styrene margins deteriorated to a loss as market supply improved following second quarter industry outages. Oxyfuel margins declined relative to the second quarter, but remained above historical averages. Propylene oxide margins continued to moderate on softer demand for durable goods. In the fourth quarter, lower benzene and ethylene raw material costs are expected to improve styrene margins and bring the styrene business closer to breakeven. As we expect, lower seasonal demand will lead to further margin compression across most of the remaining IND product lines. Despite the improving outlook for styrene, we have decided to idle production at our Dutch propylene oxide and styrene monomer joint venture during the months of November and December due to the high energy costs and weaker European demand. Overall, we expect to run our global IND assets at approximately 75% capacity during the fourth quarter. We remain on track to start up our new PO/TBA plant in Houston during the first quarter of 2023. Lastly, as we have completed the validation steps for the IND portion of the value enhancement program, and we look forward to the implementation plans to be done by year-end. Now let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the results of the refining segment. The third quarter EBITDA decreased to $190 million on moderating margins following an extraordinarily strong second quarter demand for refined products. In the third quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined to about $47 per barrel, but remains well above historical averages. Due to planned maintenance, we operated the refinery at 80% of capacity with an average crude rate of 215,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect continued strength in the Maya 2-1-1 spread driven by a tight market and strong demand. We plan to run the refinery above 90% capacity during the fourth quarter. The successful completion of the planned maintenance during the third quarter demonstrates our commitment to safely operate these assets with high reliability until we exit the refining business at the end of 2023. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. I'm extremely excited to be joining the Advanced Polymer Solutions team. With integration now complete, I look forward to increasing our agility, speed and customer focus to maximize the value of this business. Now let's review the third quarter results on Slide 15. Third quarter EBITDA was $66 million. Margins in the Compounding & Solutions business and the Advanced Polymers business were both pressured by higher feedstock and energy costs. Volumes for our catalloy roofing polymers decreased due to unplanned downtime at one of our major customers. We expect similar results from this segment during the fourth quarter with a small volume improvement from increased automotive production. In my initial meetings with our APS customers have witnessed the considerable and growing demand for circular and low-carbon solutions. The APS business provides a natural extension of the value chain for LyondellBasell's sustainable solutions, and our team is actively addressing these opportunities. As Peter mentioned, we believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential. While our team will have some autonomy to instil a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you again to the entire LyondellBasell team for successfully navigating this challenging quarter. To close out our segments, let's turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA declined by $20 million to $92 million due to lower catalyst demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect our licensing revenue will moderate and catalyst volumes will decrease due to lower demand on a weaker macroeconomic outlook. We estimate that fourth quarter results for the Technology segment will be roughly half of quarterly results seen thus far in 2022. After the slow beginning to 2022, our licensing business signed six new agreements during the third quarter to provide polyolefin process technologies for five projects in Asia and one in Europe. Over the history of our company, LyondellBasell has sold more than 300 polyolefin licenses around the world, and we continue to be a leader in this space. As indicated by our activity to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany, we are making good progress on developing our MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And during my recent visit to our technology center in Italy, I was impressed by the rich legacy of innovation at LyondellBasell and the creative work underway to launch this exciting technology. We hope to provide you with further updates and reach an initial investment decision for a commercial scale plant in the fourth quarter. Now let me summarize our third quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide 17. Despite very challenging markets, our team is delivering results. Our goal is to capture value and move forward on strategic priorities under a variety of economic conditions. We remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values. The outstanding safety performance from our team is just one indicator of the passion and commitment that I see across our workforce. Our O&P businesses are under pressure from weaker demand, new supply and higher energy costs. With our diverse business portfolio often provides balance. In the third quarter, our oxyfuels and refining businesses provided offsets with margins that remained well above historical averages. With over $550 million in dividends and share repurchases during the third quarter, our commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. LyondellBasell is focused on serving growing customer demand for our Circulen products. We recognize the differential needs of these businesses and are rapidly moving to enter multiple partnerships to secure the plastic waste feedstocks required to advance the leading position of our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate seasonally weaker demand and volatile energy costs will further pressure fourth quarter margins. In response, we are proactively lowering operating rates to match reduced demand. Our business leaders are optimizing working capital and further strengthening our balance sheet flexibility. We'll remain watchful for market improvements in China as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during 2023. I hope that you can sense our excitement around the initial progress towards developing a north star to guide LyondellBasell's strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we launched the new organizational structure and established a circular and low-carbon solutions business unit. We are building the structures and leadership that will enable LyondellBasell to quickly advance and our initial strategies with new business models that address our customers' needs. We're also highly energized around the prospects of unlocking the opportunities identified by our value enhancement program. We have put into place the required infrastructure and management expertise to organize, support and track our progress. We aim to leverage LyondellBasell's core competencies and target value opportunities totaling $750 million in annual recurring EBITDA by the end of 2025. In closing, we look forward to sharing more details over the coming months and at our Capital Markets Day in New York next March that should clarify your understanding of LyondellBasell's forward strategy. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : I think I'd like to dig in first with your PO/TBA plant that you're talking about starting up in the first quarter, how would you assess the supply and demand fundamentals of PO/TBA right now, given you got some idle capacity, are you potentially considering a delay on that start. And maybe longer term, do you have a view on how that the competitive landscape in PO/TBA is going to be given your competitor probably is pretty high on the cost curve with the cost of chlorine these days, do you see potentially some rationing of capacity down the road? . Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Steve. Good question, Peter here. No delay in the startup on the PO/TBA plant. As we have alluded to with the Q2 results, fall, we are, I mean, quite favorable in our costs on the PO/TBA side. This is a world-scale plants, very well integrated. So we believe that independent of what is happening in the marketplace, we are very well positioned to start up that plant, and therefore, no changes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Just a couple of related questions on your Circulen economy. When you look at Circulen, what kind of return on capital are you targeting? And can you talk a little bit about your contracting structure that will ensure your return on capital. And then secondly, on decarbonization, you have this joint venture with Air Liquide, Chevron and Uniper. I guess with the passing of the IRA and the new 45Q credit. How do you think about the hard to abet sectors like ethylene? And any update on your cracker electrification related to that? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, P.J. Very good questions, as usual. On the Circulen economy, we are at the very early stage in this year. But just coming back, I mean, from the Kfar and Dusseldorf. You know this is organized every two years that was an amazing positiveness around renewable and circular solutions, both, I mean, from the brand owner side as well as from the companies that were actually producing the packaging. So we noticed that there was quite some demand, I mean, to accelerate the amount of volumes that are being brought into the marketplace. And as a consequence, of course, willingness to pay, that is there across the value chain. So that gives us the commitments that we are, as you have seen during the last couple of weeks with the creation of that strategic business unit that we are accelerating because we see this as a value proposition, which is quite attractive. Then on the second question on the IRA, I will give that question to you, Ken. Ken Lane : Yes, sure. P.J. Thank you for the question. what we've commented before has not changed in terms of our targets looking out to 2030, we're making very good progress on reaching that 30% reduction that we put out there. When you start talking about some of the other options around CO2 reduction like electrification or carbon sequestration certainly, things like the tax benefits that you see coming out of the IRA for CO2 sequestration is going to help. But we're going to look at all of those options in our portfolio. And as you can imagine, every site is a little bit different. It depends on the location of the site and what infrastructure is available around it. And we're going to keep exploring those in the coming months, and we'll be able to share more about that later. But right now, it's really more in the exploratory phase and assessing what the potential is for these technologies today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : I guess I just wanted to get your perspective on how the next couple of years could shake out. I know it's still early, but you have provided some discrete items here, including the $750 million by 2025. So if you consider that Q3 EBITDA around $1.1 billion, maybe there's some uplift as you go through seasonality into Q2 and Q3 of next year. And then you layer in the PO/TBA gains as well as extra EBITDA from Hyperzone and some of your other projects. What would you say is kind of the new prof level of EBITDA? Would we be mistaken if we were to annualize that 1, 2 to 5 and then maybe move up into the $6 billion range, just given some of your investments at a trough level. Is that a fair assumption? Peter Vanacker : Let me take that question. Peter here speaking. As you alluded to, mid-cycle earnings, what we talked about in the past was increasing from $6.5 billion to $8 billion. And you mentioned a couple of these elements that bridge that $1.5 billion, one being the Zelman acquisition, then our joint venture that we have in China, the joint venture with Sasol and Louisiana, the Hyperzone investments or POSM joint venture as well as the PO/TBA. So you may know that on top of that, our commitment to increase value on the bottom line by EUR 750 million on a run rate by the end of 2025. So that means that if you look at the year 2026, we expect, I mean, to capture that fully that $750 million. And of course, we are still in progress of developing our North Star strategy. So more on that to come then with the Capital Markets Day in March, I mean, next year, and if we find other opportunities to create value. In case that question comes up, by experience by launching these value enhancement projects in the first year, one may expect that about what -- 20% of that can be captured on a run rate basis by the end in that first year. So this is not something that is completely back ended towards 2025 that due to the fact that we already have the teams in place, we have a transformation office in place the value capturing, the sequencing of the different topics starting immediately. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Josh Spector : Just on your European assets within O&P. So I mean you're taking actions today and you continue to take more to address some of the lower profitability. I guess if we think about this energy environment persisting for next year plus, are there other actions that you would take to optimize your asset base further? And I guess where are you kind of in the line of thinking along making changes, further changes to the region? Peter Vanacker : Well, thank you for your question. And it's needless to say that, of course, our crisis management team has been up and running already since quite some months even before I joined the company. So we continue to monitor very intensively what is happening in the marketplace. We alluded to I mean on the call to the actions that we had undertaken. So the Berre cracker in France will not start up prior to the end of this year. But needless to say that we are monitoring that situation in the marketplace every week to then define what the right time will be to start at the cracker. In addition to that, we currently have a scheduled shutdown ongoing in the smallest of the steam crackers in Germany, so-called OM4 steam cracker. We expect that to start up on time. And there we would not take any action to delay that startup. And then what Kim alluded to is that the joint venture asset that we have in Rotterdam, that has been idled for the time being. And then, of course, also there, we will evaluate how the market is developing, especially on the styrene monomer site because we hear, of course, also in the markets that on-purpose styrene monomer production have been idled or multiple or even question, that will they be profitable and be started up again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : I think I have a question for Ken Lane. China is being -- China purchases oil at a discount to the Brent price from Russia. Does that purchasing, that discounted purchasing provide a cushion to Chinese petrochemical margins? Or does it not influence Chinese petrochemical margin? And can you sort of characterize the state of the Chinese polyethylene market these days. . Ken Lane : Sure, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So we've done a lot of investigation into that, as you can imagine, because what we're seeing in the China market, we're at historically low spreads there and a lot of that is driven by the new capacity coming on. But our view is a lot of that oil is actually going into the state-owned refiners and not being passed on to the market in terms of lower priced feedstocks for the polymers. What's happening in China is really more related just to the higher capacity and the lower demand that we're seeing there. So that is going to be the larger driver in the even midterm -- what we really want to see is the growth come back in the China market, which we've not seen as of yet, and you may recall, going back to even the first quarter earnings call, we were talking about expecting to see some recovery in demand in China already after Chinese New Year, and that just has not materialized. So once we see that and that demand starts to absorb all of the new capacity, then I think you're going to start to see a return to a more normal level of spreads in China. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Aleksey Yefremov : We saw energy prices in Europe have come down quite a bit in recent weeks. Could you attempt to sort of provide mark-to-market, how much better your profits would be in EMEA and perhaps in IND if these energy prices kind of stay the same and all other factors were like in place as well. Peter Vanacker : Do you want to make comments first, you can, what\u2019s your views on this. Michael McMurray : My view is that we're seeing some moderating in the headwinds around the energy costs and feedstock costs in Europe, and that could be short-lived. If we have a cold winter, then we might see that reverse. But longer term, obviously, one of the things that we're going to be looking at are ways to improve the competitiveness of our assets. What can we do to make the flexibility of our feed slate and the energy consumption that we have in those assets more competitive. And frankly, some of that is going to be related to our CO2 reduction targets because believe it or not, that is a way that we will improve competitiveness is by finding lower CO2 energy by making the assets more efficient and improving our cost position. So a lot of things are going to happen over time here. And we're currently very focused on what's happening in the short term, but don't let that make you think that we're not thinking longer term about how we position ourselves more competitively in the region. Peter Vanacker : And all that to be put in perspective, of course, I mean, year-to-date, European energy costs for us were $1.8 billion higher compared to 2020 in the same period. Michael McMurray : And Peter, you want to maybe make some comments from an enterprise perspective to help the analysts and investors kind of think sequentially as well. I mean, things lagged down substantially in August versus July. It was pretty dramatic. And those reasons were highlighted in our release today and then September deteriorated further. And as we look forward to October, it should be a bit better than September. And as you pointed out, we are seeing some relief in both feedstocks and energy costs. And I would say, broadly, it feels like we're kind of finding maybe a bottom. But to be clear, Q4 will be sequentially lower than Q3. We're facing into persistent inflation, high-cost energy, weaker seasonal demand and we're missing fixed cost absorption with all the idled and curtailed assets, which are heavier curtailed in Q4. So again -- and we're also experiencing the full effect of lower prices from the third quarter. So again, dramatic drop-off from July to August. So we will be sequentially down. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Could you speak a little bit more in more detail about the program to get it to $750 million and maybe an area I would appreciate some focus on -- what are the things that you're doing that are taking until 2025 to see the EBITDA show up in your results? And if you could also comment on what, if any, cash costs are associated with going after the $750 million? Peter Vanacker : Thanks, Vincent. very good question. Let me do one step back. I mean we have set this transformation office and organized a large number of bottom-up workshops across the different functions, so the commercial functions, supply chain functions, procurement functions, but also very important in our U.S. largest manufacturing sites. And out of that came this around 2,000 IDs early stage in projects. So we have not yet covered the European region, and we have not yet covered the smaller sites. But we see already that we get lots of IDs on how to create value. And a lot of these IDs do not materially demand higher OpEx or higher CapEx. So these are the ones that, of course, we will focus upon. And there can be, of course, it's a very broad range. So it is about energy management. It is about creep capacities clear if we don't need a creep capacity because of the market situation, these will not be the projects that we will do first. They will then come later. But it's a very, very broad range, I mean, of projects that we have here in terms of covering the entire portfolio. So we'll provide more details on that when we talk on the Capital Markets Day because we will have progressed more as well. As I said, we are now in the phase of prioritization. So what out of those 2,000 IDs do we actually want to implement to make sense in the current market environment. So then we go, I mean, to the so-called stage number 4 and then make the people available, I mean, to capture those opportunities. Next year, we will start doing the analysis also in the European sites. So we will start with the larger sites and then also move to the smaller sites. So that should normally also has in the confidence that we can at least capture $750 million by the end of 2025 on a run rate basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Peter and Ken, can you discuss the outlook for the U.S. polyethylene market in the context of the new capacity coming on from both Shell and Bay part over the next few months here? Peter Vanacker : Ken? Ken Lane : Some of that market. They've been doing some premarketing for quite a while now. So Obviously, going back to what I had said earlier, just around China, what's going to be very meaningful is overall for the market supply demand is going to be the return to growth in the market. And these assets, like any are going to get absorbed. I'm sure they're very competitive assets based on the feedstock situation in the U.S. So -- there will be a period of time now where we're going to have to weather that and absorb that in exited Q3 is where I expect us to be in Q4. So things like Michael had referred to earlier, things really dropped off in the middle of Q3, and we've kind of levelled off in that range. So what we're doing now is taking actions that we can control to improve our cash flow and be able to meet demand without being cash suboptimal here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Most folks are looking for some degree of a recession next year. So I'm just curious when you think about the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and you annualize that, why wouldn't that be sort of the trough potential for Lyondell heading into '23? And then what needs to happen for the first half of '23 to be better than the second half of '22? Peter Vanacker : That's a very good question, of course, and we've alluded to that and Ken made comments as well in this call. Very important just to look at China. What will happen in China, how will demand be encouraged in China? That's a big question mark. I mean you know that China normally imported about 40% of their needs in polyethylene. So at this point in time, not a lot of growth in China, and therefore, the material is not flowing into China either. So that's an important element to look at. And of course, I mean, what about the cost situation. We've alluded to that also in the call already energy costs on the other hand side, electricity costs, of course, included in that. And Ken, anything you want to add? Ken Lane : I think you've hit it. Again, it's going to be getting more growth back in the market and seeing some of the headwinds around feedstocks and energy come off, which right now is hard to predict. Peter Vanacker : What we have seen also in the past, if you just look at the history, then markets have relatively quickly recovered as well. That doesn't mean that I'm not saying that we have seen the trough going back to Michael's comments before. But how long can I stay like this is the question that we are all looking at. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : I was wondering if you could speak to your inventory levels internally as well as your perception of inventory downstream among your customers reason I ask is you've put forth some very low operating rates for the fourth quarter. If I look at the inventory on your balance sheet, it's up, but it's not up dramatically, maybe 3% or 4% year-over-year. And so just looking for some context, do you think these low operating rates will serve to rightsize inventory by year-end? Or might it take longer than that? How would you frame that issue? Peter Vanacker : Thanks for your question, Kevin. Maybe I'll start by saying that our teams have done an excellent work in focusing on cash management and you see that from the results. So -- and that, of course, includes on one hand side, payables and receivables, but also we have dealt, I mean, with our own inventory levels, as you recognized as well. Now when we look at the downstream and it depends, of course, a little bit from market to market. But normally, in the ID business, we don't have a lot of inventory in the pipeline in the channel. And can allow me to say that what we have seen is that the inventory levels also in the polyolefin side, they have reduced during the third quarter. Ken Lane : Yes, that's right. I mean, we certainly -- we've adjusted and what you've seen even with the adjustment to the utilization rates that we've communicated is we're adjusting the utilization rate to match what we see with our demand and we'll continue to do that in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mike Leithead : Just two around capital uses and returns. First, I wanted to reask part of Vincent's question and just see if you could give us at least a rough cash spend figure for the $750 million EBITDA value-enhanced program? And second, just on circular and low-carbon solutions. I assume this is going to be a focus area in March. But could you just give us a rough sense of the capital you tend to spend annually on this area? And just any sort of commensurate type EBITDA or return on capital or return hurdles we should expect there? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you for your question, Mike. I mean, of course, clearly, as we have pointed out in the past, our capital allocation strategy has not changed. You remember that I said also looking at our CapEx investments, around EUR 2 billion, $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion in sustaining CapEx and the rest of mining growth CapEx. Well, if you look now at 2023, we are, of course, reflecting upon what is happening in the marketplace. So you may not expect -- I mean, to see that number of $2 billion. It will be quite lower. So therefore, you will not really see an uptick because of our value enhancement program in terms of CapEx, if you look at it in the overall CapEx that we have invested in our business because as said, I mean, the number for next year will be lower. And then of course, as you roll out these programs, like the value enhancement program, they don't have a beginning and an end. They become part of the DNA in the company. as continuous improvement. So at the beginning, of course, in the first years, there will be more low-hanging fruit, how we operate not heavily in OpEx and CapEx, so you won't see it, so to say, in the overall numbers. And then when we start talking about 26, 27, then probably, I mean, you talk about debottlenecking activities and so on. But then every project on its own will have to have its own merits and we will reflect on every project on the IRR. So it will be, of course, as said, it must be a value enhancement project that we have that is not dilutive for the company in terms of our IRR or return on capital. And the return profile of these projects is generally very high. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is Matt [indiscernible] on for John. Specifically in O&P-EAI, you noted your plan to run the crackers in Europe slightly lower quarter-over-quarter. But are there any other expenses to consider either that you incurred in 3Q or will incur in 4Q when we're trying to bridge the quarter-over-quarter profitability in the segment? Peter Vanacker : Yes. You know that we have always been extremely focused on costs. So cost discipline, even when I joined LyondellBasell, I was quite amazed. I mean how deep it is embedded in the DNA. So yes, we have not announced a certain number in terms of cost preservation, cost reduction but remain sure that, I mean, this continues to be managed on a daily basis, so where we can actually reduce our costs, but not at the expense of our value enhancement program. Michael? Michael McMurray : Yes. Maybe I'll reinforce a couple of things. So I mean, no doubt, the current environment has implications for our spending plans, both this year and next year. And then as you would expect, we are taking appropriate actions in particular in Europe. And as Peter said, our value enhancement program will also help. So it's incremental, but interestingly, it's also sustainable. . And then we have a great team, and we've demonstrated our ability to navigate difficult environments like in 2020, where we covered our full dividend and capital program with cash from operations. We already operate lean which gives us an advantage versus others. And as Peter also said, that said, our view on safety and reliability is steadfast. We don't want to destroy long-term value put our assets in parallel. So again, we're confident in our ability to manage and actually come out stronger on the other side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch for Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : I wanted to offer my congratulations to Kim. I believe we met Kim a few years ago in a channel view site tour. And as part of IND, you indicated that you're going to run in the fourth quarter at 75% operating rate. I was wondering what that was in the third quarter. I don't believe I saw that. And then also that 75% operating rate in the fourth quarter, there are a few different segments within IND. Is there any area that is going to be particularly higher or lower than that 75% average? Kim Foley : Thank you, Frank. And yes, I remember our visit through the Cataby facility quite well. I hope to see you again as we start up the new PO/TBA plant later next year or early next year, I should say. As it relates to your question, the operating rates in the third quarter were about 75%. So we're basically steady or equivalent quarter-on-quarter. Some of the differences as far as what we're operating is around my comments that I made earlier in the presentation. So we'll be idling the P11 or the propylene oxide styrene monomer plant in Maasvlakte and the way that we -- what we will do with that is we'll have the opportunity to help improve the styrene supply demand as well as run our PO/TBA plants at higher capacity. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. Peter Vanacker : Okay. Thank you, everybody, and thank you for joining also all your as usual, very thoughtful questions. We look forward to sharing more of our plans and how LyondellBasell will advance on our strategy and unlock additional value over the coming months. I wish you all a great weekend. Stay safe and looking forward to meeting you again soon. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today until March 3 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13734290.  Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook.  With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Let's begin with our safety results on Slide number 3. LyondellBasell's employees and contractors delivered an outstanding safety performance during 2022. Injury rates at our company have consistently been among the lowest for our industry. But last year, we reduced the rate of injuries across our global workforce by roughly [0.5] to 0.12 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. At our Bayport complex outside of Houston, our team finished 2022 with over 6 million consecutive safe work hours, a new company record. Simply put, a consistent focus on safe work is embedded in our company's DNA and provides a solid foundation for extending that shared focus across other dimensions of the company's culture. Let's now turn to Slide number 4 to discuss our financial results. 2022 was a very challenging year characterized by a war in Ukraine, evolving responses to the COVID pandemic, energy volatility, inflation and rapidly changing monetary policies. At LyondellBasell, our portfolio of businesses continued to provide value for our global customers with products and solutions that are essential for modern society. In '22, LyondellBasell delivered earnings of $12.46 per share with EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Cash generation was exceptional and resulted in $6.1 billion of cash from operations; second only to our 2021 results. We ended the year with $6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment rate balance sheet. Interim invested capital was 16%, far exceeding our cost of capital. In addition to our focus on safety, we are sharpening our strategic focus to maximize value for our customers, shareholders and society under a range of scenarios. On Slide number 5, we outlined our progress on delivering value from this strategy over the past year. Our leadership in cost management and operational excellence enabled LyondellBasell to hold fixed costs well below inflation, and quickly adjust operating rates in response to evolving market conditions. Our diverse global business portfolio provided outstanding cash generation during a challenging year. And at the same time, we positioned the portfolio for changing times with decisions to exit refining and sell our Australian polypropylene business. We established a new business unit, focused on establishing leadership in providing circular and low-carbon solutions for our customers. And we are advancing our supply chains, production capacity and sustainable assets to serve rapidly growing markets for these circular and low-carbon products. Last quarter, we announced our increased focus on capturing value as we continue to manage costs. We expect our value enhancement program will generate at least $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. Our increased focus helped drive a [13 percent point] improvement in cash conversion in 2022. That further bolstered our capital structure and supported generous shareholder returns. On Slide number 6, I would like to highlight our recent decisions to accelerate progress on our climate targets and create more value by doing so. In order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, climate scientists believe that global warming should be limited to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In December, we announced our decision to increase LyondellBasell's 2030 targets for reducing scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to 42% and established a new Scope 3 emission reduction target of 30% relative to 2020 levels. Targets are now aligned with the science-based guidance and the 1.5 degree Celsius scenario. In addition, as we continue to make progress in sourcing, favorably priced renewable electricity, we have increased our 2030 goal to procure at least 75% of our global power generation needs from renewable and low-carbon sources. Earlier this week, we announced our first 2 renewable power purchase agreements in Europe and 2 additional agreements in the United States. Altogether, we now have 8 agreements in place for 930 megawatts of renewable power capacity, which represents roughly 1/3 of our global needs. These agreements will prevent nearly 1 million tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions. All of this work supports our goal to become net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050. At the same time, we continued to build global businesses that will sell at least 2 million tons of recycled and renewable base polymers by 2030. On Slide number 7, let's take a look at how we are building our Circle brands of recycled and renewable base polymers. During the fourth quarter, we announced progress in developing 4 new plastic waste sorting and recycling facilities in Houston, Germany, India and China. These facilities provide a strong foundation for a robust global supply chain for plastic grade feedstocks. And with our 3 product platforms, CirculenRecover for mechanical recycling, CirculenRevive for advanced recycling, and CirculenRenew for renewable-based feedstocks, LyondellBasell will be able to match feedstocks and products with the highest value solutions for our customers. The combination of our focus, detail, technologies and global platforms provides LyondellBasell with powerful advantages to build the world's leading circular and low-carbon Solutions business. Now with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by highlighting our excellent cash generation from our business portfolio during 2022. LyondellBasell generated a total of $6.1 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Our cash on hand increased to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2022, we achieved cash conversion of 96%, 13 percentage points higher than our 2021 cash conversion. In the fourth quarter, cash conversion reached an outstanding rate of 203%. This efficient and robust cash generation allowed the company to return a total of $3.7 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2022. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. Our approach remains focused on disciplined capital allocation and strong returns for our shareholders. During 2022, cash from operating activities fully funded dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. We returned approximately 60% of the cash from operating activities to shareholders. This included $3.2 billion in quarterly and special dividends and $420 million in share repurchases. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%. This represents our 12th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $1.9 billion in capital expenditures. A significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction of our world-scale PO/TBA plant. Startup activities remain on track for the end of this quarter. Our transformation of is working across our company to rigorously manage and track the progress of our value enhancement program. We look forward to sharing the progress of this program at our Capital Markets Day in March. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $865 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected margins stabilizing at the low levels seen towards the end of the third quarter. Moderating energy and feedstock costs provided modest offsets for compressed margins in our olefins and polyolefins businesses. Overall, OMP demand remained low, particularly in Europe and China. Intermediates and Derivatives results sequentially declined on lower volumes due to the quarterly timing of oxyfuel vessel shipments. Margins at our oxyfuels and refining businesses remained above historical averages as demand for fuels remained strong due to increasing global mobility. High cost for utilities and raw materials coupled with low seasonal demand negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge impacts pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $90 million. Fourth quarter LIFO charges were approximately $15 million for O&P Americas segment, $50 million for the O&P [EII] segment each for the intermediates and derivatives in APS segments, $15 million for the Technology segment and a $40 million benefit for the refining segment. As a reminder, volatility in natural gas prices impacts our cost for not only gas, but also steam and electricity. We estimate that a $1 per million BTU change in the price of natural gas impacts the energy cost of our directly operated assets by approximately $175 million per year across the company with 80% of this impact in North America and 20% in Europe. These estimates do not include the impact of gas price on feedstock cost. Before I turn the call over to Ken and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our segment results in more detail, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2023 on Slide 11. As our new world-scale PO/TBA plant ramps up, we expect to produce and sell about half of the asset's nameplate capacity in 2023. We remain confident that our value enhancement program can achieve recurring annual EBITDA of $150 million by the end of 2023 through the execution of about 1,000 projects. In order to achieve this benefit, we expect to incur a similar amount of onetime capital and operational cost of about $150 million, with the majority of these costs allocated to capital. Major planned maintenance for 2023 included a turnaround at one of our Midwest ethylene crackers in the O&P Americas segment, turnarounds at our acetyls assets and 3 propylene oxide plant turnarounds within our I&D segment. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2023 EBITDA and by approximately $290 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. During the fourth quarter, we recognized costs related to the exit from our refining business, which impacted EBITDA by $73 million. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect the business will incur similar EBITDA impacts during each quarter of 2023. We will also recognize about $55 million each quarter for depreciation charges to reflect cost accrued for asset decommissioning that will be incurred after the asset shuts down. We expect that our capital expenditures will decline by about $300 million to approximately $1.6 billion this year with the completion of the PO/TBA plant and disciplined spend resulting from the current business environment. Approximately $500 million of CapEx is targeted towards profit-generating growth projects with the remaining balance supporting sustaining maintenance. We expect that this year's capital requirements for the value enhancement program will be funded within our $1.6 billion CapEx budget. Other financial metrics worth noting include net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, pension related estimates and tax rates. We expect 2023 net interest expense will be approximately $405 million. Depreciation and amortization charges for 2023 are expected to be $1.4 billion, which includes the [$202 million] of additional refinery depreciation charges related to asset decommissioning. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2023, totaling about $65 million with approximately $105 million of pension expense for the year. We expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate will be lower than our ETR.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter O&P Americas EBITDA was $359 million. Prices and margins stabilized at the low levels we saw at the end of the third quarter. Market demand declined, and we also saw customer destocking during the quarter. That, combined with new polymer capacity resulted in well-supplied markets. We operated our assets at approximately 75% of nameplate capacity to match the reduced market demand and manage working capital. During January, we have seen modest improvements in domestic and export demand. Normalization of logistics constraints have facilitated increased export volumes. Also, moderating feedstock and energy costs are providing some margin tailwinds. As a result, we expect to operate our O&P Americas asset at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter. Looking back at 2022, I want to highlight our progress on developing our Circulen business. We have established projects for classic waste sorting facilities that will be used to provide feedstock for our circular recover and certain the Revive product lines. We are also moving phoned our usage of olefins feedstocks produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil. During 2022, we processed 15,000 tons of renewable feedstocks at our Channelview, Texas cracker, to produce ethylene, propylene and ultimately, polyethylene and polypropylene that we sold to customers at premium prices under our Circular brand. Last year, 4 of our U.S. manufacturing sites attained the ISCC Plus certification for certain grades of polyethylene and polypropylene. This enables LyondellBasell to offer customers mass balance certificates for these products and serve the market's rapidly growing demand. We are delivering these new circular new products to our customers and proving that polymers can be more sustainable and used in any application where virgin polymer is used. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. In Europe, macroeconomic pressures were exacerbated by high inflation and energy costs that curtailed operations at our customers and pressured consumer demand. LyondellBasell operated our O&P assets at rates of approximately 60% during the fourth quarter. LIFO inventory charges were $50 million during the quarter. All of this combined to result in a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $152 million. European energy costs have considerably moderated in January, and demand is showing some signs of improvement over the extremely low level seen in December. We have completed repairs and we started our integrated cracker in France at the end of 2022 and expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 80% during the first quarter. As in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies to support our Circulen and Low Carbon Solutions business in Europe and Asia. During October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China, and a fully automated mechanical recycling facility in India. These partnerships will allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose plants in each region to supply feedstocks for our circular products has served a rapidly growing market for circular solutions. In November, we announced our decision to move forward with engineering to build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. This plant will utilize LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology to convert plastic waste from our waste sorting facility into pyrolysis oil that can be used as a feedstock to produce new plastic resins in a circular process. We are moving rapidly to build circular and low-carbon solutions for our industry at an unmatched scale.  With that, I will turn the call over to Kim. Kimberly Foley : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $291 million. Styrene margins improved due to lower feedstock costs. Oxyfuel margins remained well above historical fourth quarter averages. Oxyfuel volumes declined as the timing of the vessel sailings resulted in unusually high third quarter volumes. We operated our assets at rates of approximately 75%. Our propylene oxide and styrene joint venture in the Netherlands is expected to restart this month after 3 months of downtime in response to volatile European energy costs and lower demand. We look forward to initial volumes from the new PO/TBA asset in Houston by the end of the quarter. We plan to operate our assets across the IND segment at approximately 80% in the first quarter. In January, we are encouraged by unseasonably strong oxyfuel margins with low butane feedstock costs and strong oxyfuel blend premiums. We expect relatively stable margins for the segment for the first quarter. We developed multiyear maintenance schedules to ensure that our plants can safely and reliably serve our customers. As it works out, 2023 will be a heavy year for maintenance across several of our PO/TBA assets. Maintenance is scheduled for 2 of our 3 PO/TBA plants at our Bayport, Texas facility in the second and fourth quarters. Our [indiscernible] PO/TBA facility in the Netherlands will also undergo maintenance from September through November. We expect the ramp-up in volumes of our new plant will be partially offset by loss production from this planned maintenance. Nonetheless, the incremental 2023 PO and TBA volumes should be sufficient to capture typical market growth. In 2024, we expect less scheduled maintenance and the full year of production from our new assets will provide additional volumes to serve market growth. Now let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $40 million. Results increased on higher margins and slightly higher volumes following the third of the planned maintenances, offset by the disruptions of the December freeze. In the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread modestly increased to $48 per barrel, remaining well above historical averages. Despite unplanned downtime, we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 229,000 barrels per day. In January, the Maya 2-1-1 spreads have also been unseasonally strong at more than $50 per barrel, driven by strong discounts for heavy crudes. We expect to operate the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity in the first quarter. Finally, I would like to recognize our team at the refinery for finishing the year with 0 recordable injuries in 2022. This is the first time such a record has been achieved in the 104-year history of this facility. Our team is dedicated to safely and reliably operating these assets until we exit the business.  With that, I will turn it over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $3 million. Margins remain pressured by feedstock and energy costs as well as the $25 million noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge. Volumes fell on lower seasonal demand exacerbated by high power prices that impacted our European customers' businesses. In the fourth quarter, we embarked on a journey to transform the APS segment. Our goal is to sharpen our focus on customer service and product development to maximize value for our customers and for LyondellBasell. With increased autonomy and accountability, we are developing a more agile operating model with meaningful media and segment growth strategies. As part of this transformation, the Catalloy and polybutene businesses will be moved from APS and reintegrated into the O&P segment beginning January 1, 2023. This move will allow the APS team to sharpen their focus on the compounding business, distinct from the Polymer business of Cattaloy and polybutene, which serves our O&P value chain. From a portfolio point of view, we estimate APS will shift approximately $200 million of annual EBITDA between O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments very equally. We plan to provide additional information regarding the impact of this change in March. I strongly believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential and I look forward to reporting on our team's progress in delivering on this transformation during our Capital Markets Day in March.  With that, I will return the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Torkel. And to the entire LyondellBasell team, thank you again for all the hard work in delivering strong results during a challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, reduced global polyolefin industry operating rates resulted in lower catalyst volumes, licensing revenue moderated due to the timing of milestones for revenue recognition. We estimate that the first quarter results for the Technology segment will be similar to fourth quarter 2022 as catalyst volumes improve, offset by moderating licensing revenue. Our technology team is hard at work advancing engineering on LyondellBasell's first commercial advanced recycling plant. This plant will leverage on proprietary MoReTec technology to extract sale from most consumer mixed plastic waste by closing the loop and producing feedstocks for our Italian crackers. Our technology provides distinct advantages by reducing energy consumption, improving yields through innovative process designs and catalysis. Let me now summarize our results and first quarter outlook with Slide 18. Despite highly targets, our team is capturing value and moving forward on our strategic priorities. Most importantly, we are sharpening our focus on leveraging the scale of our clear portfolio to deliver resilient results. We remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values. Last year's outstanding safety performance speaks to the depth with which safety is ingrained in our corporate culture. Our goal is to expand our core petro foundations to encompass a more comprehensive passion for value creation. This week, we welcomed Trisha Conley to our Executive Committee as Executive Vice President, People and Culture. Trisha will play a pivotal role in leading LyondellBasell's vision and strategy to enhance the employee experience, elevate our organizational performance and create the best and most inspiring culture in our industry. In 2022, our businesses were pressured by the effects of the war, volatile energy costs emergence from the pandemic and monetary policy. We responded by matching our reduction with changing demand, leveraging our global business portfolio and maximizing cash generation. Over the past year, our businesses generated over $6 billion of cash from operations and returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Lander focus and commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. The more annuity formed circular and carbon solutions business, we are laser-focused on meeting the needs of our customers, brand owners and society. Our decarbonization goals are now aligned with science-based guidance, and we have made substantial progress towards our 2030 goal to procure 75% of our electricity from renewable and low-carbon sources. The Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is well positioned to address the challenges of sustainability and plastic waste. By building an end-to-end business with robust supply chains, proprietary technology for transforming materials and our global manufacturing and marketing network, we're confident that we can build a large-scale and valuable leadership position in this exciting and expanding market. And our focus on sustainability is gaining recognition. In December, we were honored to be awarded the EcoVadis Gold Medal for sustainability performance with a 91st percentile ranking. The EcoVadis platform is valued by procurement professionals for assisting in the identification and evaluation of sustainable supply solutions. We expect modest improvements in the first quarter from moderating energy and feedstock costs, stable demand and the absence of fourth quarter life for charges. Normalizing supply chains or enabling improved trade flows from our advantaged feedstock positions in North America and the Middle East. Nonetheless, we will continue to maintain focus and discipline to ensure that operating rates across our global portfolio are matched to market conditions. As the year progresses, we anticipate seasonal demand improvements during the second and third quarter. And we're keeping a close eye on China's emergence from Covet and potential benefits from increased economic activity during the second half of 2023. The most exciting challenge during my first 8 months as the CEO of LyondellBasell has been the process of identifying and building a compelling strategy that generates substantial value for our customers, suppliers, employees, communities and shareholders over the next decade. We've shared some initial decisions with you already, but much more is ahead. As you will have recognized, we have waited until the Capital Markets Day, but started moving ahead with great focus and speed in the right direction. On Slide 19, we ask that you save the date for March 14, when we will share more details on our forward strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York, and we hope that you can all join us virtually or in person. We are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Just had a quick question on China reopening. What do you see in terms of inventory in China at the ports? And then maybe you can make a comment on your China joint venture with Bora and where you -- what were the operating rates there? Peter Vanacker : Thanks, P.J. This is Peter. Let me take your question first and then potentially Ken can also add to that. When we talk about China, it's still early stage to say that we see a sustainable recovery. We expect -- I mean that, that will take probably another 3, 4 months until we see that recovery is actually happening. So we're still very modest in our expectations on China. But at least, I mean, we know that there has been the opening. So the government has changed their way. I mean, how to look at that -- at COVID. And Bora, still hanging in there, I would say. Not very positive because of the situation and because of capacity utilization rates locally in the market being at technical minimums. Ken? Kenneth Lane : Yes, that's right. We continue to operate the joint venture of technical minimums. We've seen -- in two weeks, we're seeing a little bit of improvement in consumer demand, but it's really far too early to say that that's going to continue. Margins are continuing to be challenged. So we're seeing red load spread there still. So even with that improvement of demand, it's not translating yet into improved spreads. So -- we're watching that very closely, of course, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: And the situation on PO is no different than on the situation of polyolefins? Kenneth Lane : Correct. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : I wanted to just drill into the EAI segment here. Is the EBITDA loss-making a result of just the fixed cost absorption of running at 60% or were cash margins negative in the region in the quarter? And Ken, you mentioned demand improving. Is that sufficient to drive operating rates from 60% to 80%. Do you think that margins will remain stable? Or do you see risk of that given others may restart with lower and lower energy costs as well? Kenneth Lane : Thank you, Steve. Good question. And the other aspect that I would add, I mean, to what you -- to your question is, of course, also on the energy costs. As you know, I mean, energy costs have also moderated on a still very high level. [indiscernible] factor of 8 more expensive versus the United States, but at least, I mean, we're not at that peak anymore also helped them by the winter that has been very moderate so far in Europe. So I would hand over -- I mean, to give a bit more color to what is happening in the market to Ken. Kenneth Lane : Yes. Thank you. And just to remind you, we did have that LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of $50 million. So -- but looking at what we see coming out of the fourth quarter, we hit a very low point there because demand was coming off, energy costs were high. They moderated at the end of the quarter, and we're seeing that continue in the first quarter. We also had our [indiscernible] fracker down during the fourth quarter. So -- that's why our operating rates were lower. Those repairs are complete, the fracker is back up. Similar to what we see in China, we're seeing some improvement in consumer demand. But again, I would say it's still early. Let's not call it a win yet, but we're definitely seeing some early signs of consumer demand improving there. So overall, the margin environment is going to improve mainly because of what Peter had said around the energy costs. Operator : Our next quarter comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho Securities. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Could you just give your outlook on various regional operating rates and what's been happening across NGL and feedstocks? Could you just give us your latest update on the NGL front and what that just generally means for the progression of integrated [PE] margins throughout the year? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Chris. Ken, do you want to? Kenneth Lane : Sure. Yes, I'll take that. Listen, NGL production continues to increase. So we expect that to be a tailwind, especially for our position here in North America. The oil and gas ratio is going to be continue -- or continue to be favorable for our portfolio. We don't see that really changing. We do expect there could be some strengthening in the oil price as we go through the year just as demand potentially comes back with China reopening. So all in all, I would say that the environment today should be better than where we were in the second half of last year around feedstock synergy in our portfolio. Peter Vanacker : And I think nat gas, I mean, [indiscernible] to $40 back to where it was in the first half of 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Bhavesh Lodaya : This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. You highlighted improving operating rates in North America in the first quarter. As we think about 2023, what type of U.S. domestic demand growth do you expect? And then as we think about like a further recovery in operating rates back to like historical levels, how much of that depends on rising exports and reducing some of the logistic constraints out there? Peter Vanacker : It's a very broad question, of course. I mean, let me try to digest to put it in different buckets here. I mean, needless to say that when we talk about the demand for mature goods with high inflation rates, which are still high with interest rates that continue to go up with new house builds and houses being sold still being very -- a very low base, yes, it's clear that we expect that the demand for durable goods will continue to be at least for the foreseeable future depressed. What we have seen on the other hand side, as we have seen in other cycles, is that demand for nondurable goods is relatively stable, not to say, I mean, in certain areas, even strong. So that has led to the fact that we have given this guidance that we say, I mean, we are now operating in the Americas at 80% utilization. And Ken already talked about the European utilization rates, which was [indiscernible] at 80%. In the I&D, I mean, you know that we have a start-up of the PO/TBA sands, as we alluded to and Kim said, starting up at the end of this quarter, which will add, I mean, a bit more volumes of propylene oxide -- but let's not overreact on that either because we have, of course, our scheduled shutdowns, turnarounds that we have moved to the periods when we are starting up, I mean, the new facilities. Stock we'll be able to grow a bit, but operating assets currently is at 80%. Also here, a tick higher than it was at the end of last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : A two-part question. When you think about the shutdown of your refinery at the end of 2023, does that mean that there are reduced operating rates in the fourth quarter of 2023? That is, do you have to really prepare to shut it down or you get to the end of the year and you shut it down? Second question is, you gave a sensitivity to natural gas price changes. You said every dollar per MMBtu is [$175 million]. And you said 20% is in Europe. So that's roughly 35 million MMBtus. The European gas price today is maybe $17 an MMBtu. And last year, it averaged $37. So it's down $20. $20 times 35, $700 million. So is that the benefit for 2023 if gas prices in Europe stay where they are relative to last year? Have I done the calculation correctly? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Jeff. Very good questions. I mean, talking about the refinery, as we have said, I mean, we want to shut down the refinery in Houston by the end of 2023. So that has not changed in our opinion. The rationale for that has not changed either. And of course, there is some preparation that needs to be done in order to be hydrocarbon free by the end of the year. So Kim, if you want to add something on that question? Kimberly Foley : I would just tell the audience that we're working through the detailed plans of how to do that. As you alluded, you can do that with a slow ramp down? Or are you going to do that by just pulling the plug on the 31st [of the year], and we're working through the different scenarios to make sure that we have the most efficient an effective shutdown in clearing process. Peter Vanacker : Answer your second question, of course, I mean, if you just do the math, then you make up to that conclusion. But let's not forget that in Europe, our teams have done an excellent job by also increasing prices on one hand side, on the other hand side, also implementing energy surcharges. So you can't actually net that out the way you did, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Congrats, Michael and David on the Institutional Investor Magazine recognition, well deserved. Michael, you made good progress on working capital in 2022, and I'm wondering what the expectation is for 2023. And in terms of uses of cash, there was a breather on buybacks here in the fourth quarter. CapEx is coming down in '23. What are your thoughts in terms of a resumption of the buybacks? Michael McMurray : So good question. So I think, first, I mean I just -- I'd point out again that the cash generation in 2022 was extremely strong. Excellent execution by the businesses from a working capital perspective during the year. In the fourth quarter, in particular, longer-term perspective as well. Kind of turning to this year and looking forward, I would say that, I think, first and foremost, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. And you all know that we have a reputation for generating strong cash flow and returning to gain cash flow to our shareholders, and that expectation has not changed. Thinking specifically about 2023, I would point out that CapEx is going to be down materially. So expectations for capital is about $1.5 billion. It is going to be a tale of 2 halves for this year with an expectation that the second half gets stronger. As we move here into the first quarter, it's my expectation that working capital should be flattish. But as I look towards the balance of the year, I actually hope to consume some working capital with better sales and better pricing. And then remember, our growth investments are starting to pay dividends as well, in particular, with the start-up of PO/TBA. And so again, as I think about the full year, it's my expectation, and I'm looking at Peter and he's nodding at me. But we will continue to return meaningful cash to shareholders, including growing our recurring dividend. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Shifting back to polyethylene. Could you give us what you anticipate a reasonable range of outcomes is for Chinese polyethylene demand growth during 2023? And how much of that you think will need to be sourced from the ex-China market? And if you also had a view on what their demand growth actually turned out to be in 2022, that would be helpful. Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, Vincent. Ken is already close to that. So... Kenneth Lane : Yes, we are very close to that. Vincent, thank you for the question. Look, our view for the last 2 years is the demand for polyethylene in China has been relatively flat. So when you talk about a range of outcomes for 2023, if you look historically, after 2 years like that, you would expect to see a significant snapback in growth, but it doesn't mean that that's a guarantee. So you could see anything from flat to plus 8%. It's very hard to call. That's why that's one of the markets that we watch very closely just because it is largely the price that are in the market. And will drive the absorption of all the new capacity that has come on. But we'll watch it closely and hope to see some more signs of recovery in the near future and more to come. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : I have a long-winded question. So U.S. ethylene and polyethylene capacity has -- there's a cost advantage. And there's long-standing thesis that due to cost advantage, U.S. can export to anywhere in the world almost as much as necessary. It's not what's happening right now, right? You and the rest of the industry has lower capacity utilization. So why is there not an increase in export? Is it not economical or other logistical limitations that don't allow it? And could this change as we go through 2023 such that your utilization rates go up due to higher exports and there's no imbalance in the domestic market as a result? Kenneth Lane : Alex, this is Ken. I'll take that question. We've -- during the quarter, we actually did see both as an industry but in LyondellBasell as well an increase in exports. Some of that was related to some improvement in demand overseas, some less imports coming into some of the closer markets like South America from other regions. But also the relief of some of those [indiscernible] logistics constraints that we were dealing with in the first 3 quarters of the year, it really started to free up in the fourth quarter. So I think that you're going to start to see that continue in the first quarter and we'll get back to a more normal level of exports for 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : This is Richard on for Mike. Just wanted to touch on the value enhancement program. You've identified $150 million in cost savings for 2023. I know we're probably going to get more details on the call Markets Day. But any details early on in terms of what you've able to identify where are the buckets of savings are coming from? And then also just the cadence of the savings through this year would be great. Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, Richard. This is Peter. Good question. The process -- I mean, the value enhancement program is ramping up quite impressively, I must say. We've done the major sites in the United States. And since the beginning of the year -- I mean the 2 major sites actually in Germany. We're expanding now also to other sites as we speak during the next quarters, both in the United States as well as in Europe. more than 3,000 projects that have been identified so far. And it goes, I mean, from areas in the manufacturing side to procurements to commercial excellence, supply chain management. So it's a very broad portfolio of different projects. We will give a couple of examples during the Capital Markets Day to make it more tangible. Today, we are mainly focusing on projects that have a very fast payback time, not so much projects that add and increase capacity, which is logical if you look at where the market is, but it is a continuous stage gate process that we have, where we continue to prioritize projects based upon the returns and based upon what we are seeing in the marketplace. So stay tuned, I would say, to get more specifics on a couple of examples on the 14th of March at the Capital Markets Day. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Duffy Fischer : Two quick questions. One, in the increase in your operating rates across segments, does that contemplate some inventory build for the summer season? Or does that also -- or do you see that as kind of sell-through as well for Q1? And then on the polymers for Americas, what -- or what's your plan, I guess, for the split between U.S. sold and export this year versus next year? Do you have to improve your export percent meaningfully with the new capacity in North America? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Duffy. I mean, let me split it up in 2 parts on your working capital question on the inventory question. First of all, Kim will give a bit of overview on the PO side. And then Kim can also talk about the olefins, polyolefins. Kimberly Foley : Thank you, Peter. So as it relates to the propylene oxide side, yes, we're building a a slight bit of working capital as a contingency for the startup. But once the startup is successful, which we have tremendous confidence in that inventory level will come down. And we expect throughout the year to operate at about 85% capacity based on the modest demand we see in propylene oxide right now. Peter Vanacker : Yes. So I talk a little bit about O&P, and I want to just echo what Michael. It's -- the teams have done an outstanding job in the fourth quarter managing our assets to be able to maximize cash flow and really focused on producing the products that we need to deliver with customers. We'll continue to do that going forward as we see markets improve, we will increase our operating rates to match that, and that may end up as Michael said, in markets taking working capital, but that's a good thing because we're going to have a stronger business as a result. But I'm just very proud of the team and everything that they did to manage that during the fourth quarter, which was quite a difficult time. To your question around increase in exports, we're going to continue to to see an increase in exports, I think, in general from the United States market or from the Gulf Coast market, just with all the new capacity coming on. As a company, we have been increasing the portion of exports for us as we ramp up the capacity with the new hypers assets. We're going to continue to see that happen. But clearly, our strategy around channels to market is to find the highest value customers and segments and that tends to be closer to home. So we're always trying to find more business here and we use the exports to really optimize the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Can you discuss your view of the U.S. polyethylene contract pricing opportunities seems as though spot export prices have come up appreciably year-to-date, while producer inventory has been rationalized to some extent. So perhaps you can talk through what you're seeking currently and your level of confidence that will turn the corner and start to see contract prices move higher as the first quarter progresses? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Kevin. Well, it's clear that we continue to have price increases out there in the U.S. market. And we're hopeful that these price increases, we see at least there is a good development in the marketplace. Ken? Kenneth Lane : Yes. So look, I'm confident we've seen strength in the export market that we did not see last year. So that's a good indication. And I think I mentioned this on the third quarter earnings call, we've sort of seen prices come down to all those parity with export pricing. So as you see exports go up, you should see domestic prices moving up, and I'm confident then the first quarter, we're going to see some increases here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Joshua Spector with UBS. Joshua Spector : Just on APS, I'd just be curious if you want to comment on what the normalized earnings of that residual business is -- I mean, if you move $200 million over, I think even looking prepandemic, maybe there's $200 million in residual, like $250 million residual. Schulman used to be about $200 million, and you've got some synergies on top of that. So curious if you could give us some color there. Peter Vanacker : Definitely very good question, Josh. And this is one of the reasons why we have repositioned this APS business as well because we are, of course, not happy at all with the results in the APS business. And yes, there are lots of factors that they roll on market demand and higher costs that we have seen last year, energy cost feedstock costs -- so therefore, we have decided to mic reposition this business. And [indiscernible] like run it as a separate company within LyondellBasell. Michael, do you want to add? Michael McMurray : Yes. Peter, first, I just want to say and express that I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the Advanced bottomer solutions business through the transformation that we're embarking on. And I see a lot of potential in this business. And I put it in place a team that I think really can deliver. And the steps that we're taking, this Catalloy and [PB-1], or polybutenes or where that we're -- we really view [indiscernible] as a better fit in the O&P segment. This enables the new, what I call the new APS, to be very focused on our core value-creating model of compounding and customer solutions for brand owners and OEMs. We did well on the integration and cost reductions, but our APS business needs a much more customer-centric operating model. And this is going to be part of the journey that we are now embarking on it with the transformation. And our focused improvements in customer intimacy, technical support and service levels I think will really allow us to fix this business and grow it in a profitable way. And I'm looking forward to share more about this transformation journey at the Capital Markets Day coming up. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Peter, on your Circulen volumes, what are the price premiums you\u2019re receiving and what types of margins are you realizing on these Circulen volumes? A \u2013 Peter Vanacker : Yes. Good question, of course. As we go into the markets with an entire portfolio, so we have a reasonable part of the portfolio, we have the circular part of the portfolio, which is either mechanical recycled or advanced recycled. We are in the market \u2013 I mean, with the entire family. Yvonne will give more insights in our go-to market during the Capital Markets Day also with our aspirations that we have by having set up this strategic business units, Currently, this is a market which is extremely short. Demand is substantially higher than the supply in the market. So we\u2019re completely sold out in the products that we have available. The premiums that we are getting are quite attractive. Yes. I\u2019m not going to put a number on it as we speak. You\u2019ve heard numbers, I mean, from other calls. And I can say we are at least on that level. That said, Yvonne will be more insights on the aspirations that we have during the Capital Markets Day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. Peter Vanacker : Thank you very much, and thanks again. Very good questions, very thoughtful questions. And once again, I hope that you will join us on March 14 as we will then share how LyondellBasell will advance on our strategy and unlock substantial value over the coming years. As we have said in the prepared comments for this call, we have not waited until the Capital Markets Day. We have already put a lot of things into action. And the purpose of the Capital Markets Day is to go deeper into the more specifics on the different pillars of our new strategy. I wish you all a great weekend, and as usual, stay safe. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, David. Welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We will begin on Slide number 3 with our safety performance. Our workforce continues to deliver excellent safety performance for the start of 2023. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.16, which continues to be below the rate seen in prior years. Safety will continue to be a fundamental part of our core values as we move forward with the implementation of our exciting new strategy. Let's turn to Slide number 4 and review the new strategy that we launched last month at our Capital Markets Day. As you can see, much work was already underway. Our strategy is built around three pillars. We're convinced that the successful implementation of our new strategy will increase our normalized EBITDA by $3 billion to $10 billion by 2027. This should ultimately result in a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. The three pillars for growing and upgrading our core, building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business; and finally, stepping up our performance and culture. And the grow in upgrading the core, we are focused on the areas of our portfolio where we have leading positions and competitive advantages that are aligned with our long-term goals. We will reinvest to grow and improve upon those advantaged positions by leveraging our leading technologies to generate returns at scale. In the second pillar, we are committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business that would enable our leadership in circularity and address the massive customer demand for these products and solutions in a profitable way. We expect this business will generate at least $1 million of incremental EBITDA by 2030. The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. We have established a value enhancement program that is prioritizing and delivering on these initiatives. Our value enhancement program is on track to deliver more than $750 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. These three pillars do not stand alone. The pillars of our strategy are interconnected and reinforce each other. For example, we step up our performance and culture to create value. We will reinvest that value in growing and upgrading our core. Returns from a larger and more profitable core will be allocated to build a more sustainable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And the cash generation from all these activities will continue to provide generous shareholder returns. Our strategy serves the needs of our customers, employees, investors and society. We did not wait until our Capital Markets Day in March to start executing this strategy. Slide number four highlights our actions across three pillars over the past year. As part of growing and upgrading the core, we announced in April 2022 that we would exit the refining business. We are now evaluating options to transform the facility to serve our long-term objectives, particularly around circular and low-carbon solutions. Last April, we divested our Australian polypropylene business and at our Capital Markets Day, we announced a strategic review for our ethylene oxide & derivatives business. We are improving our focus with investments in businesses that fit with our long-term strategy. An example is the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world over the past month. This project was an enormous undertaking across two Houston area facilities. During the height of construction, we had a workforce of more than 3,000 people. This is the sixth PO/TBA plant built by LyondellBasell since inventing the technology in the 1960s. Our plant doubles the scale of our prior plans, improves yields, increases product recovery and incorporates hundreds of design improvements that save energy, reduce emissions and lower costs. The net result is that we believe propylene oxide from our PO/TBA technology has a lower carbon footprint relative to the most widely used PO technologies. And our cost of production is the lowest in the world. The new plant was producing on-spec products at rates of 70% or above within one month from start-up. I want to sincerely thank our team for all the hard work and dedication that went into this extremely successful launch of a new production capacity. The PO/TBA plant is just one example of how we are growing and upgrading our core businesses. Through our value enhancement program, our team is unlocking additional production volumes across our business portfolio through hundreds of initiatives to increased capacity and improve reliability. In the second half of last year, we established our circular and low-carbon solutions business unit to address the rapidly growing demand for circular and renewable products. Since that time, we have staffed up the organization and announced multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements. Just this week, we announced that LyondellBasell will acquire the other half of our QCP mechanical recycling joint venture in Europe. This is another step forward in our work to achieve our sustainability goals. We are securing recycled and renewable feedstocks and building regional hubs to leverage our technologies and provide powerful advantages for our comprehensive business model. Last December, we increased our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals to establish a leadership position within our industry by aligning with science-based climate guidance. As part of this, we set a goal to procure at least half of our global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In just 10 months, we've announced agreements that will achieve 70% of our renewable power target with approximately 1,100 megawatts of renewable generation capacity. The agreements will reduce LyondellBasell's greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1.1 million tons, and that is nearly 15% of our 2020 Scope 2 emissions. We provide an in-depth look at our progress on sustainability with our newly published 2022 sustainability report. And as you know, that is available on our website. This report highlights how we can create substantial enterprise value through leadership in sustainability, which is core to our strategy of creating solutions for everyday sustainable living. Our work to step-up performance and culture is the third pillar of our strategy. In October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. And at our Capital Markets Day, Torkel Rhenman describes the work that is underway to transform our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In addition, we are leveraging the structure of our value enhancement program to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. Altogether, the three pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to form a growth engine that captures value and delivers a more profitable and sustainable portfolio of businesses. Let's now turn to slide number five to discuss our financial performance. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered solid results, reflecting moderately improving market conditions. Earnings were $2.50 per share, more than 90% at best our fourth quarter results. EBITDA was $1.5 billion, and we generated nearly $500 million in cash from operating activities. We ended the quarter with $1. 8 billion of cash on hand and $5.8 billion of available liquidity. Our company generated 12% return on invested capital over the past 12 months. The strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enable us to confidently move forward with our strategy, while continuing to provide attractive returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide six, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash generation. In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated nearly $500 million of cash from operating activities that contributed toward our total of $5.1 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash balance was $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Over the last four quarters, our team efficiently converted 89% of our EBITDA into cash. During the first quarter, our cash conversion dipped to 35% driven by increased sales volumes and additional inventory required to serve customers during upcoming maintenance. Nonetheless, we expect to continue converting approximately 80% of EBITDA to cash over the longer term, as we have done in the past. We remain committed to delivering returns to our shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we returned $3.5 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Let's continue with slide seven and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the past four quarters, we returned 107% of free cash flow to our shareholders. This is well above the annual target of 70% that I shared with you at our Capital Markets Day. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividends and share repurchases. First quarter capital expenditures were $352 million, approximately $120 million less than the fourth quarter. With a successful start-up of our world-scale PO/TBA plant, capital expenditures related to the construction of the plant will be replaced with growing cash generation. Our continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects remain within our plan of $1.6 billion for 2023. Now, I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on slide eight. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect moderate margin and volume improvements across most segments due to improving global demand and lower energy costs. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from higher asset utilization. Demand for fuels remained strong, and our oxyfuels and refining businesses continued to earn margins above historical averages. Please note that our first quarter segment results reflect the movement of our Catalloy and polybutylene businesses from the APS segment to the O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments, effective as of January 1st. We filed an 8-K on March 7th that provides summary historical financial information for the three prior years. During the quarter, we recognized $69 million in cost related to the exit from a refining business and a non-cash goodwill impairment of $252 million related to our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to incur approximately $75 million of EBITDA impact as well as $55 million of depreciation related to the exit from our refining business during each quarter of 2023. As a follow-up to our 2023 plant maintenance guidance, we decided to pull forward some planned maintenance in our O&P Americas segment to the second quarter. We expect this will result in an additional impact of $90 million for a total estimated EBITDA headwind of $110 million for the segment during the second quarter of 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on slide nine with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the first quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA increased $157 million to $541 million. North American Olefins margins improved on lower feedstock costs, while polyethylene margins increased on higher pricing. In the second quarter, we expect slightly better seasonal demand leading to modest improvements in volume and margins. The recent start-up delays for new industry polyethylene capacity should tighten markets and benefit margins over the coming months. Costs for feedstocks and energy are expected to remain relatively low during the summer season. LyondellBasell will continue to manage operating rates in line with moderately improving demand We expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at a rate of approximately 85% in the second quarter. This is inclusive of the additional planned maintenance mentioned by Michael. In February, we announced a new long-term feedstock agreement with Nexus Circular. This will supply LyondellBasell's low-carbon solutions business unit with 24,000 tons per year of recycled feedstock. Nexus Circulars new facility will convert mixed plastic waste into recycled liquid feedstock for our ethylene crackers, ultimately producing new plastics under the circular revived brand. This agreement is just one component of our rapid multifaceted strategy execution. We'll now turn to slide 10 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the first quarter, we increased operating rates after the restart of our integrated cracker in France. European margins benefited from lower energy costs, but weak demand for durable products persisted. As a result, O&P EAI first quarter EBITDA increased $225 million to $77 million. Looking ahead, we expect slightly better seasonal demand in the second quarter. Our operating rates will reflect that improvement, targeting approximately 85% of capacity for the O&P EAI assets. While Europe remains a challenging environment, especially for durable goods, we are focusing on serving customers and optimizing our assets to deliver highest value. As we mentioned at our recent Capital Markets Day, our teams continue to make good progress developing our regional hub model for circular and low-carbon solutions. Through a fit-for-purpose diverse mix of products and technologies, we will scale this up to become a leader in circular and renewable solutions. With that, let's turn to slide 11 to discuss the hub model in more detail, the first of which will be located in Cologne, Germany. As [indiscernible] described at our Capital Markets Day, our business model was built upon an integrated approach to plastic waste. This begins upstream with advanced waste sorting through our joint venture with Source One Plastics and partnership with EEW Energy from Waste, both of which focus on recovering plastic waste that would otherwise be incinerated. From there, we can utilize our mechanical recycling footprint with our QCP and APK investments, which can be sold under the Circulen recover brand or move further down the value chain into compounding where we can leverage our APS segment and the newly acquired Mepol Group to create additional value. Alternatively, these waste sorting operations can take hard to recycle plastic waste to create feedstock for advanced recycling. Newly developed technologies such as our catalytic Mortech process, allow for waste to be converted into pyrolysis oil. In addition to our Mortech technology, which we hope to FID later this year, we are utilizing long-term feedstock agreements with suppliers like Nexus Circular. This pyrolysis oil from advanced recycling is the feedstock for our ethylene crackers. Most importantly, it allows us to produce materials identical to virgin resins under our CirculenRevive brand. This generates meaningful value for our customers that use polyethylene and polypropylene in applications such as healthcare, where mechanically recycled plastic waste cannot be used. Lastly, renewable feedstocks are another sustainable option for our ethylene crackers. Through suppliers such as Neste, we are able to process feedstocks from bio-based sources such as waste and residual oils and fats to produce CirculenRenew polymers with a low-carbon footprint. Advanced recycling and renewables are excellent feedstock sources for ethylene crackers. Both are similar to naphtha or heavier liquids, making LyondellBasell well-positioned to capture this value with the feedstock flexibility of our existing assets. All of this is already underway, and our hub model will allow us to scale globally and reach at least 2 million tons per year of recycled and renewable based products by 2030. Since 2019, we have sold nearly 200,000 tons of products. We are convinced that LyondellBasell is uniquely positioned to be the supplier of choice for our customers and brand owners who want to partner with us to lower their greenhouse gas footprint and make their products more circular. We see tremendous value across the entire value chain, and we will continue building on our momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim Foley : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 12 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased by $135 million in the first quarter to $426 million. Propylene oxide volumes increased with higher operating rates after planned downtime last quarter, while margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Oxyfuel margins remained strong, supported by low inventories and steady demand for gasoline. Overall, we operated our assets at approximately 85% for the quarter. As highlighted at our Capital Markets Day in March, we have successfully started up our new PO/TBA plant, which is the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This start-up was many years in the making, and I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished. In line with the guidance from last quarter, a heavy planned maintenance schedule across our propylene oxide assets in 2023 will largely offset the benefits from this new volume during the first year of operations. In 2023, we'll be focused on driving safety, quality and reliability as we fine-tune the operation of this new PO/TBA plant and ramp up cash generation in 2024. For the second quarter, we expect to run our global IND assets at approximately 80% of capacity in line with demand. Our new PO/TBA capacity is included in the calculation of our I&D segment operating rates beginning with the second quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA of $315 million was fairly comparable with the prior quarter, which benefited from a $40 million in tailwinds from a LIFO inventory valuation. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread remained stable at about $49 per barrel. Industry inventories for fuels remain low following winter weather and significant maintenance, coupled with stable demand. We operated the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 226,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to moderate due to declining diesel spreads while remaining well above historical averages. We plan to operate the refinery at approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter. We remain committed to safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability to capitalize on current market conditions. As Peter mentioned earlier, we have started the evaluation of several projects to transform the site to fit with our circular and low-carbon solution strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the first quarter results on Slide 14. First quarter EBITDA increased $52 million to $26 million. Margins for the polypropylene compounding business improved, as product sales prices captured a higher share of rising raw material prices. All of our business areas saw moderately higher demand. We expect demand will moderately improve across most APS businesses during the second quarter. After spending time in this role, I've met with many customers who have told us how much they value our products and innovations. We're working every day to improve our service levels and meet our customers' needs to transform this business. As we mentioned last quarter, we have reshaped APS by moving the Catalloy and polybutane businesses into the O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments, which will allow us to focus on what is core to APS, serving customers with tailored solutions. To further support the growing and shaping of APS core, we announced in March that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mepol Group. Mepol\u2019s expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our overall strategy to be a leading provider of sustainable solutions. We are confident that our APS platform has significant potential. While our team will have some autonomy to install a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives. With that, I will return the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. First quarter EBITDA of $73 million reflected stable catalyst volumes and lower licensing revenue. In the second quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will be moderately better. Nonetheless, we estimate that second quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the first quarter. As Ken discussed, we believe that LyondellBasell's circular and low-carbon solutions business has a strategic advantage with our integrated hub solution. A key enabler to scale our hubs is LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic-recycling technology. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and reach an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year. Let me now summarize our first quarter and the outlook for our company with slide 16. Our first quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value through our new strategy with help from moderately improving market conditions. LyondellBasell's foundational commitment to safety remains at the core of our culture and will continue to be a critical enabler for our future success. Our O&P businesses benefited from moderately improving demand. Our oxyfuels and refining businesses continue to see margins above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate modest seasonal demand improvements. North American polyethylene margins should benefit from delays in industry capacity additions. In response, we're aligning our operating rates to match market demand. We remain watchful for market improvements in China, as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during the second half of the year. LyondellBasell is focused on serving rapidly growing demand for our valuable circling products from our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We're entering multiple arrangements to secure plastic waste feedstocks and build out the regional apps that will drive our advantage. And we are making progress on our climate targets in less than one year since signing our first power purchase agreements, we achieved 70% of our target to procure at least half of global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. At our Capital Markets Day last month, I hope you sense our excitement around our new forward strategy. Last week, we gathered 150 of our global leaders to provide feedback and align on implementation. The energy and enthusiasm around our initial progress is incredible. From our frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers, developing innovative solutions for our customers to three pillars of our strategy for providing focus and clarity for our progress to capture incremental value and deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine at LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. This FID that you're targeting at the end of the year for the MoReTec technology, is it fair to assume that you're thinking about building this at the refinery site, given you have all these hydrotreaters available that could be used to treat the pyrolysis oil, you could also use the hydrotreaters to make your own renewable feedstock rather than buying it from Neste and you need a lot of hydrogen to do all this. Could this site become a hydrogen hub as well and get some DOE funding. Peter Vanacker : Hi Steve, this is Peter. Thank you for your question. Of course, as usual, very good question. The first MoReTec industrial scale deployments that we are referring to the -- we plan to have an FID until the end of this year will be in the Cologne hub. But of course, we're also looking at the Houston hub, and I have alluded to that before, that we are looking at the refinery to also deploy an investment in terms of MoReTec our own technology. So -- but the first one, to be very clear, will be in Cologne. And rightfully so, I mean, as you recognized, if we do a MoReTec investment in the Houston hub, we can leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydro crackers that we have there to upgrade a plastic oil and then feed the plastic oil through the pipeline to our Channelview cracker. So, it's an ideal situation that we have there. So that's the focus that we currently have. It's all around, our MoReTec advanced recycling technology. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. What are the total cash costs for shutting down the refinery and remediating whatever needs to be remediated if there is something? Michael McMurray : Hey, Jeff, it's Michael. Let me help you out with that. So I'll refer you back to an 8-K that we issued last year. But we anticipate a number of charges. So there's charges associated with the existing operating lease assets. So this would include like tanks and other infrastructure. There's asset decommissioning cost, so like things like tank cleaning and then personnel-related costs as well and then some miscellaneous charges. So our total cost estimate -- and this is still a good estimate today. We had given a range of about $600 million to $900 million. It's unlikely and this is happening, that they're not going to be recognized all at once, so we've been incurring some cash and some non-cash costs now largely non-cash this year, and they'll continue into 2024 as well. And you're seeing charges per quarter right now of about $85 million, similar to what we had seen in 2023 as well. On the fourth quarter, we did raise our estimate on asset decommissioning costs slightly, and you've seen some incremental depreciation related to that. But that's within our $1.4 billion estimate for the full year. And then don't forget, there will be a meaningful working capital release when we shut down the refinery -- it's on the order of about $700 million is what we're expecting. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning, guys. Nice start to the year. In terms of fundamental polyethylene demand, where do you think we're running at here in the first quarter, heading into the second quarter and -- and how do you think it holds up in the second half of the year? Peter Vanacker : Yeah, Mike, I'm going to give that Ken to answer that question. The first thing that I want to say is, our sales teams as well as the operations team, they have done an excellent job in navigating very well both in polyethylene as well as in polypropylene through challenging market environments. And the result is, of course, what you see then on the EBITDA in Q1. Ken? Ken Lane : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. We're seeing modest improvements from Q4. Q4 being very low, and we saw a lot of destocking, especially in Europe in the fourth quarter. So I'd say overall demand is going to modestly improve going into Q2. We typically see some seasonal improvement. We have begun to see some improvement in China. The consumer is sort of waking up there. So my expectation is that as we get into the second half of the year, that's probably going to be the biggest opportunity for improvement in the market is going to be how quickly China comes back I don't think in Europe and in the US, you're going to see anything different than the normal kind of Q2, Q3 peak and then a decline in Q4, which is normal for those markets. But we should see Asia performing stronger in the second half. Peter Vanacker : And I'll hold that in the context, of course, if you just look at Eurozone GDP first quarter, that was practically no growth, okay, not a deep recession, but on the other hand side, I mean, 0.1% growth. And needless to say, as you hear it all over the place is that this is especially in durable goods that the market continues to see a very conservative consumer behavior. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. I was just trying to figure out in your PO business, your non -- other than the new plant you're starting up, roughly, what are you running the rest of your fleet at? And then what do we need to see for PO to get healthier? Do we need to see some industry shutdowns, or do we just need to see business come back to a normal level and the profitability levels per unit can kind of come back to where they were maybe 1 year, 1.5 years ago. But just what's your outlook there for the rest of the year, if you would produce? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Duffy. Very good question. And that allows me again to repeat what a huge success that is to be able to start up that PO/TBA plants. I mean the largest that is in the entire industry, on time, safely and is now ramping up just like inset to demonstrate, I mean maximum capacity in that plant. So really, I mean, an incredible -- and I must say, even when I compare that to my previous assignments and other companies, I've never seen it going that move. So really a great job by the entire team, which gives you Kim some time to answer the question. Kim Foley : As it relates to the business environment, I think it's very similar to what you heard from Ken and Peter related to durable demand. The biggest outlets for propylene oxide are polyurethanes that go into insulation, they go into furniture, they go into the construction industry, paintings and coatings. So until we see housing turn you're going to -- the demand is going to be weak. And the question is what's going to happen with interest rates and how will that influence housing demand, not only in the US, but also some of the challenges that they have in Asia, as far as their construction and real estate markets. So as we look forward, we have some optimism, but I think it's heavily weighted on what happens with interest rates. To your other question as it relates to industry consolidation, yes, we would love to see some consolidation from fourth quartile assets around the world, but those are decisions that each and every manufacturer has to look at and make as they assess their portfolio. Peter Vanacker : And Duffy, that a part of the PO consumption is going into bedding into furniture. But there is also a part that is going about, I would say, 20% is going into automotive. And if you look at the automotive industry in terms of builds, the latest the IHS numbers were, let's say, April expectation, close to 4% increase. So it's not all negative. But as long as we don't see that the construction market will start to pick up, then we expect that it will be moderate in terms of demand growth in PO, but we are ready for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Josh Spector : Yes. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on demand and specifically around China in terms of what you're seeing in terms of on-the-ground demand and inventories for polyethylene and polypropylene. And you made a comment on, I mean, your prepared remarks around delays in polyethylene capacity in North America being helpful. I mean, at least on paper, there's capacity coming out in China at meaningful scale. Is there anything you could comment on there that's going perhaps per plant slower or faster than you expected? Thanks. Peter Vanacker : Ken? Ken Lane : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. No, there's nothing that we see really meaningfully different in terms of the developments around China capacity additions. They seem to be coming on about the way that we had expected. So really nothing new there. But again, what we're starting to see is consumption is improving, converters and downstream customers are being a little bit more careful. They're not wanting to build inventory. So that's part of what we see in terms of, I'd say, the slow ramp-up. They're being very risk-averse, but the demand is beginning to come back a little bit as far as consumer goods. To the point that Peter made earlier, durables are less strong in terms of the recovery, but we still see good demand in food packaging and those sorts of markets. Peter Vanacker : Can we say, Ken, I mean, if you look at just at March, export from the U.S., that went up as well? Ken Lane : Yes. So exports from North America have gone up in the in the month of March pretty significantly, if you look at the ACC data. So that's going to continue, I think, into the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Peter, can you talk to the strength of the oxyfuels margins and how sustainable it might be beyond the seasonally stronger period we're about to enter? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, David. Good question. We continue to believe, I mean, that the oxyfuels markets, if you look at it compared to the history, will continue to be strong. Maybe a little bit. But I will give it to you Kim, to elaborate a little bit more. Kim Foley : Thanks, Peter. So I think if you think about the big drivers for the profitability of oxyfuels, at your feedstock costs, so look at your butane costs versus your crude. Look at your cost of methanol, which right now in the U.S. is favorable with low natural gas, the relative price of crude, so the higher crude is, the more favorable it is because it's the difference between the lower gas and the crude. And then the premium. And I think that's the question many people have is what's going to happen with all this new capacity as we come into the market with the -- what we call the oxyfuel for the ether premium. And we're pretty confident we have outlets for all of that material. And we think there'll be some seasonal moderation of margins as we go into the third and fourth quarter as butane pricing increases, but no concerns or plans that we haven't forecasted within our portfolio. Peter Vanacker : Yes. One needs to look like I said in the prepared remarks, I mean the new PO/TBA plant, even if we would write at 90%, 95% of capacity, we have actually proactively scheduled three turnarounds at other plants. So at the end, net-net, there is not substantial more volume that comes into the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on your Cologne hub slide. First, there's mechanical recycling that's present in the diagram -- and as you know, there is a very well-developed mechanical recycling industry that already exists. Do you have any special sauce or advantage by owning the mechanical recycling assets and having them on that one site? Peter Vanacker : Well, we do believe, and it's a very good question, I mean, Aleksey, and rightfully noted as well that this is -- as we said at the Capital Markets Day, this is the who breadth of different technologies that we are deploying globally, not just at the Cologne hub. And one of those technologies is actually the mechanical recycling technologies. And you saw from our announcement this morning that we have agreed to me to buy out and now have full ownership over the QCP assets, which are assets in Galena in the Netherlands as well as the Tekova assets in Belgium. So these assets are on one hand side, industrial mechanical waste focus, and on the other hand side was consumer waste focused. So again, here, we have the breadth of technologies that we then can bring to the market. We do believe that we have differentiated technology not just on the mechanical of course, as you know, but also on the advanced recycling and intend to continue to deploy that. Ken Lane : And just -- one thing I do want to add to that is when you look at the resins that we develop and the mechanical recycling capability that we have, being able to optimize those things. So -- if you think about some of our new resins coming out of the Hyperzone asset, they are very good to be able to increase the recycled content. So there is an advantage by optimizing your portfolio of virgin resins and recycle it content. Peter Vanacker : Yeah, that's a very important point. And that's why, I mean, this a approach, the synergies that we have, the optimization that is possible to maximize the value out of our waste. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you can give us a bit of a bridge in EAI from 1Q into 2Q and a couple of questions within that. One would just be on the energy cost position of the plant footprint. I know you said it was $90 million better versus 4Q. Does that improve any further into the second quarter? And then also, you commented in the release about in the first quarter, I believe it was 70% naphtha as a feedstock. What was the reason why you were so rich in naphtha versus LPG? And what would you anticipate for the second quarter? Peter Vanacker : I'll take that one, Vincent. Thanks for the question. So just to give you a feel, recall that we had in the fourth quarter, the -- our French cracker down. So that certainly has an impact on our energy mix and our feedstock mix as well. I think what was interesting in the first quarter is that propane was in the feedstock mix, which is atypical when you think about winter months normally propane is not in the feedstock mix. And we have a lot of flexibility in that cracker in France. So as we were ramping that up, we started to optimize the portfolio through the quarter. So you'll see some more impact. Lets say the full quarter impact of having the bar cracker up and running in the second quarter, but I'd say it's marginal. We do have a good cost position in terms of energy costs in France. So I don't expect there to be a big difference in the second quarter versus first quarter, other than what you can see in the improving price of gas in Europe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Skowronski with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Skowronski : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ken, ethane prices have fallen quite a bit, can you provide color on your outlook for feedstock costs for the rest of the year? And also, now that we're at the end of the month, where do you expect North American polyethylene prices to settle in April? Ken Lane : Sure, Matthew. So we are in a really good position, as you can imagine, for North American feedstock advantage, the oil and gas ratio is very strong. Our outlook is that that's going to continue. We've seen good increases in production in North America in NGLs. And if you look at ethane and propane inventories, they're at high levels and production continues, so I expect that we're going to see in the midterm continued strength in the advantage for North America. And like we said in the prepared statement, the -- some of the delays in the production issues that are happening with the North American capacity that's coming on, should continue to lend support to polyethylene pricing. And we've got price increase announcements out there. And certainly, we're optimistic that we'll be able to secure for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Just to follow up on the prior question. Can you comment on the demand side of polyethylene? Do you think that destocking has run its course at this point? And if so, would you anticipate any restocking in coming months? And then with regard to the new supply that's coming domestically, it seems that, as you alluded to, there's either delays or we've also heard that some units are having trouble running on specs sustainably. So welcome any color you have along those lines for the market or individual grades of resin? Peter Vanacker : Ken? Ken Lane : Yes. Sure. So listen, I'll just continue. Nothing really more to add. We are seeing tightness in some market segments more than others, which is things like high-density polyethylene, you've probably heard the issues around some of the tightness in the markets there. We expect that's going to continue, but not a lot really to add. These things are a little bit hard to predict. And exports, like we had mentioned earlier, did creep up in March, and that's always going to be one of the key factors in terms of new capacity coming on with the feedstock advantage that we have here, a lot of that new capacity is going to go offshore. And we're not faced with any of the supply chain issues like what we were seeing in the early fourth quarter those issues are gone. So the ability to move product offshore is going to help sort of evacuate that volume fairly quickly. Michael McMurray : Ken, we think destocking is largely done, but folks are buying cautiously, right? Ken Lane : Yes, yes. I would say destocking, we don't really see that occurring anymore and people are being cautious in terms of their inventory levels. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on how you're thinking about the year and maybe next year as well. We appreciate the '27 $10 billion number. But if you just look into the rest of this year, you were able to do the 1.5 for Q1 on EBITDA. [indiscernible], a little bit better, and you're still talking about weak demand. So I'm assuming there's a little bit of improvement as we go through the middle of the year. That should put you on a pace of around $6 billion. Next year, you have, unfortunately, the refinery out, which maybe is a loss of $1 billion. How do you -- are some of those kind of ways of thinking about Lyondell accurate? And how do you kind of plan to plug that $1 billion hole for next year? Thanks. Peter Vanacker : Hi, Arun, good question. Thank you very much. And of course, in the context of not giving guidance on a yearly basis. I mean, we alluded already, I mean, to the fact that we see maybe a little bit of movement in China but not substantially. So that will be a very important factor to look at if and it's a big if, during the second half of this year, demand growth would be there in China on a substantial basis. And the other point, I mean, we expect, I mean, that energy costs were going to be, let's say, relatively modest, of course, a big advantage that can leverage upon in the United States. Energy costs have gone down in Europe. But of course, we all know that they are still -- energy is still very expensive in Europe. But we don't see immediately from today's perspective that energy costs in Europe would certainly return back means that like we had gas price above \u20ac130, \u20ac140 per megawatt hour that we have seen at the end of 2022. So China continues to be a big question mark. And then how will the inflation influence consumer behavior in Europe as well as in the United States. Michael McMurray : So to put a bow around that, Peter, we think the second half should be better than the first half. That's broadly in line with what the analyst community is thinking as well. But as you said, China is the linchpin and uncertainty generally is high right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On natural gas, I think you've given sensitivity that every dollar per MMBtu is about $175 million of op costs. Did you realize all those benefits in Q1 from both lower US as well as lower European gas prices? And I guess, should we expect any sort of incremental benefit heading into Q2? Peter Vanacker : Michael? Michael McMurray : Sure. Happy to take that question. And we got some feedback from a few folks that they didn't like our rule of thumb. So I'll give you a bit more data this morning, which hopefully is helpful. But as you all know, energy prices last year surged significantly, both in Europe and the US. And so just looking at energy cost for last year versus 2021, up about $1.7 billion. If you benchmark last year versus 2020, up $3.3 billion. So we faced into some significant energy cost increases over the last couple of years. But obviously, have seen relief that started in the fourth quarter and has followed through into the first quarter of this year and now is continuing into the second quarter. So -- what I would say is that if you looked at energy cost overall for the fourth quarter for the enterprise, about $1 billion overall, in the first quarter, down roughly $200 billion. Our expectation as we move into Q2, that it's largely flattish, maybe a little bit of kind of full quarter effect. And then just from a modeling perspective, I'll give you a couple of more data points to be helpful both around North American average natural gas prices that we incurred and then Europe average natural gas prices. So for North America, average price in the fourth quarter was $5 -- roughly $5.30 per MMBtu. In the first quarter, the average was $3.10 roughly 3.10. And then for Europe, fourth quarter was $26.70, and in the first quarter was $16.60. So hopefully, those data points will help you all as you kind of think about the balance of the year from a modeling perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Peter. I wanted to revisit a series of questions that you guys obviously got on polyethylene supply additions. I mean if I were to sort of dig deeper into the different grades of polyethylene there seem to be fairly major divergences in those capacity adds. Meaning, if I take a look at LDPE, the capacity adds are fairly tepid versus HD and LL. So how do you see that sort of playing out in the near to medium term? Peter Vanacker : Ken? Ken Lane : Thank you for the question, Hassan. I mean like I said before, we've seen this capacity coming for several years. There's not anything really new here. You're exactly right, linear low and high-density capacity has really been differentially higher coming online than low density. But it doesn't change our outlook. We know -- if you go back to the fourth quarter, we really did hit sort of the bottom of the cycle at that point. And now as growth begins to come back in the market, that's going to absorb that capacity. We will sometime in the next several years, get back to a more normalized level of earnings. So not really anything new to add to that. These are things that happen, and we just we have to work through that in the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. Peter Vanacker : Thank you very much, everybody. As usual, excellent questions, very thoughtful questions. We, of course, look forward to sharing our progress in delivering LyondellBasell strategy and unlocking additional value over the coming months. I wish you all a great weekend, and as usual, stay safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation that accompany today's call is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern time today until September 4 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13739183. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins & Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP for Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2023 results. Starting with Slide 3. During today's call, we will discuss the resilient results that our team delivered during the challenging marketing conditions of the second quarter. And we will also provide an overview of our outlook for the second half of this year as well as our plans to optimize our advantaged positions to navigate volatile markets and feedstock costs. But first, let's take a few moments to review LyondellBasell's foundations and the progress we have made with our long-term strategy. Let's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety results. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.15. While slightly higher than our results for 2022, our focus on safety continues to deliver performance that exceeds the top 75th percentile for our industry. Our leading safety results produce benefits that are reflected in our operations and ultimately, in our financial performance. Safety is a fundamental part of our core values and it will continue to be a critical enabler for our strategy and our future success. Let's turn to Slide 5 and review the progress on our long-term strategy. As we shared during our Capital Markets Day in March, our strategy is built around 3 pillars : grow and upgrade the core, build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and step up performance and culture. We are confident we have the right strategy, and we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress. Let me highlight some of our actions on these pillars over the past few months. Our value enhancement program is providing benefits for 2 of the pillars in our strategy. The VEP is generating volume growth as part of grow and upgrade the core and margin improvement captured within step up performance and culture. I am pleased to see the rapid progress and execution of these VEP initiatives. We are raising our 2023 VEP target for year-end annual recurring EBITDA run rate by $50 million to $200 million based on mid-cycle margins to reflect our accelerated progress. I will provide more details on this progress in a few minutes. In grow and upgrade the core, we are investing in our business that fits with our long-term strategy. Last quarter, we announced a successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This quarter, our team successfully completed technology performance tests to prove out the full capacity of the new facility. We're also managing our portfolio to ensure that all businesses are aligned with our long-term strategy. In May, we announced that we are extending our refining operations to no later than the first quarter of 2025. Let me be clear, we have not changed our decision to exit the refining business. The extension of operations will allow us to develop options to redeploy the site's workforce and assets in support of the company's sustainable growth strategy. Now let's turn to the second pillar of our strategy. We're committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business to drive our leadership in circularity and address the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. We expect this business will generate at least $0.5 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2030. Through multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements, we are building a comprehensive business model with powerful competitive advantages that come from new technologies, [indiscernible] sources of recycled and renewable feedstocks and downstream relationships with our customers and brand owners. The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Last October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve our line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. We're leveraging the structure of our VEP to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. And Torkel and his team were making solid progress on transforming the performance of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Altogether, the 3 pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to provide focus and alignment to drive our progress in capturing value and delivering a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at our approach to establishing leadership in circular solutions. As [Devon] stated at our Capital Markets Day in March, our circular and low-carbon solutions business is taking a differentiated approach by gaining advantage in 3 key areas : technologies, feedstocks and downstream customer relationships. We believe that our comprehensive strategy based on regional health will establish LyondellBasell as the leader in sustainable solutions. We're expanding our participation further up and down the plastic waste value chain to both gain scale and maximize the returns of various waste streams around the world. Today, our team is building supply chains to bring feedstocks into our existing facilities and driving innovation through investments in new technologies. As you saw on the previous slide, we are investing in both internal and external technologies such as LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling process as well as Pryme's pyrolysis process and LMF Nord's mechanical recycling. In line with our sustainability goals, we are advancing our carbon reduction initiatives through partnerships. In June, we signed an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric cracker demonstration unit in Channelview, Texas. We have completed power purchase agreements to support the development and procurement of renewable power for LyondellBasell's locations around the world. These partnerships utilize the unique strengths of each party to deliver superior results with a common goal, reducing the carbon intensity of our products to increase the value of our products for our customers. And we are leveraging the unique capabilities of our APS segment to upgrade our mechanical recycling portfolio while offering tailored solutions for our customers. Most importantly, we are building a business that provides these solutions at scale. Step by step, we are making progress toward our 2030 goal to sell 2 million tons of recycled or renewable-based polymers annually. Since 2019, we have produced and marketed approximately 220,000 tons of these polymers. LyondellBasell's differentiated approach uniquely positions us to unlock significant value as we address the needs of our customers and society. On Slide 7, we ask that you save the date for a webinar on September 26, with Jim Seward, EVP and Chief Innovation Officer; and Yvonne van der Laan, EVP of circular and low-carbon solutions will share more details on our MoReTec technology and our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We hope that you can join us virtually. Let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss this year's updated target for our value enhancement program. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. Since the launch of our VEP, we have inspired a more agile and entrepreneurial mindset throughout our workforce. When we launched the value enhancement program last year, we announced targets to deliver recurring annual EBITDA improvements, run rates of $150 million by the end of 2023 and $750 million by the end of 2025. Our team is progressing ahead of plan for 2023. As we expanded the VEP to Europe and smaller U.S. sites during the first and second quarter, we found the enthusiasm and energy gaining momentum. We now think our recurring annual EBITDA improvement will reach a run rate of at least $200 million by the end of 2023. Let's get a bit more specific about a few of these VEP initiatives on Slide 9. At our low-density polyethylene manufacturing facilities in Clinton, Iowa, our team faced recurring reliability challenges related to valve controllers. With an investment of approximately $60,000, our team was able to upgrade the controllers and unlock more than $400,000 of annual value. The project was executed during a planned outage with VEP providing the resources required to rapidly resolve this chronic issue. Modest investment across our global engineering and procurement teams unlocked an opportunity to expand the supplier pool for electric motors at our manufacturing sites. We expect a direct annual cost benefit of $400,000 as well as an improvement in the security of our supply for these critical motors. These benefits will be realized with a total resource investment of only $70,000 over the next 3 years. At our Channelview facility, we invested the engineering resources required to implement a new process control scheme to improve yields and decrease energy consumption and distillation towers. Through better steam control and increased butadiene yields, we will realize $1.4 million in annual value at a onetime cost of $50,000. In addition to the direct financial benefits, this project supports our sustainability goals by reducing CO2 emissions by over 9 kilotons. One of our larger VEP initiatives will install a filtration system to remove solids from a byproduct stream at our olefins plant in Channelview. By upgrading the byproducts, we anticipate over $5.1 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvement from higher margins and increased utilization through a modest $550,000 investment. These examples are representative of the hundreds of initiatives in our VEP portfolio. The average annual benefit of our initiative is less than $1 million. But the program is supported by rigorous economic analysis, diligent tracking and an evergreen process. The value enhancement program has been the catalyst within our organization to rapidly implement good ideas to create value. We look forward to providing you with regular updates on our progress as these initiatives become more prominent in our results. Let's turn to Slide 10 and focus on our financial results for the second quarter. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation despite challenging market conditions. Earnings were $2.44 per share. EBITDA was $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash on hand was $2.5 billion with $6.6 billion of available liquidity. Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11 and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash conversion. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.8 billion of cash from operating activities. Our cash balance was $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our team efficiently converted 103% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 12 and review the details of our cash allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the second quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our robust cash generation comfortably covered our capital expenditures of approximately $300 million as well as our $500 million of returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.25 per share. 2023 will mark our 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. In May, we issued our first green bond to support investments that advance our strategy for leadership in sustainability. After the start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities in the first quarter, we successfully demonstrated full operating rates on these assets. Our capital expenditures are now focused on continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects. With the rapid progress in the value enhancement program and the extension of operations at our refinery, we expect capital expenditures for 2023 will increase to $1.7 billion, $100 million higher than our original guidance of $1.6 billion. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets. 75% for our European olefins and polyolefins and intermediates and derivative assets and just below 95% for our refinery. In the appendix of the slide deck, we provide updated 2023 modeling guidance, CapEx and several other items, including refresh estimates on cost and capital expenditures associated with extending the operations at our refinery business. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 13. The LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter. Our results reflect modest improvements in O&P margins and higher I&D volumes, offset by weaker refining margins. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from lower feedstock costs. Demand for oxyfuels remained strong, while margins in our refining business declined due to lower refining crack spreads.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Ken Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 14 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the second quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA increased $138 million to $679 million. North American integrated polyethylene margins increased on higher U.S. sales prices and lower ethane costs, while weak demand for durable goods continued to impact polypropylene margins. In the third quarter, we expect volatile feedstock costs and new capacity entering the market will compress margins. Also, demand is being impacted by cautious buying by our customers due to the uncertain economic outlook. As Peter mentioned, we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress on strategy. On June 1, we announced an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric furnace demonstration unit at our Channelview, Texas site. The technology could enable the company to use renewable electricity as a heat source for ethylene cracking and significantly reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our olefins production. This collaboration is just one of many initiatives underway to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business for LyondellBasell. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the second quarter, European ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs but this was offset by weak demand for polymers used in durable products. As a result, O&P EAI second quarter EBITDA increased $7 million to $84 million. Looking ahead, we expect the European and Asian markets to remain challenging with consumer uncertainty and energy cost volatility. Slow economic recovery, combined with additional supply in China will continue to be a headwind. Finally, we are growing our portfolio of recycled and renewable based polymers from consolidating our ownership in QCP mechanical recycling, investing in Pryme's plastic waste pyrolysis process, and building a flexible packaging recycling facility through LMF Nord, our CLCS team continues to build out our regional hub model to advance our leadership in circular and renewable solutions. Having said that, I want to emphasize the focus our team has on generating value and cash from operations. Our team is highly seasoned and is doing a great job at both. I want to be sure and acknowledge all of their hard work. Now I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim Foley : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased $46 million in the second quarter to $472 million. Additional capacity from our new propylene oxide facility was largely offset by planned maintenance downtime. Propylene oxide and derivative margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Demand for oxyfuels remains strong when margins were slightly lower. In line with the guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the third quarter on 2 of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately 75% of capacity in the third quarter, which includes the idling of 2 PO/SM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. In the second half of the year, we expect oxyfuel margins to compress as cost seasonally increase for butane are key raw material. Last quarter, we discussed the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant. This quarter, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the technology performance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. The second quarter EBITDA declined by approximately $200 million to $114 million as the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads settled by more than $9 a barrel relative to the first quarter. Spreads for other heavy crude oil run at our refinery, such as the Canadian WCS declined further than Maya, providing additional headwinds to our margins. In the near term, we expect demand for refined products to remain stable and inventories to remain low. The recent elevation of crack spreads will likely moderate as outages in the refining industry are resolved. Nonetheless, we expect Maya 2-1-1 spreads to remain above historical averages. In the third quarter, we plan to operate the refinery at approximately 93% of capacity. This rate provides optimal economics for our asset based on our plans for crudes, products and operations ahead of our maintenance work. We remain committed to the safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability. In the fourth quarter, we are planning for FCC maintenance with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million. We are extending operations at our refinery to no later than the first quarter of 2025. This extension will help to bridge activities at the site as we develop new projects to transform site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy.  With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Let's review the second quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA moderately increased to $34 million. Margins for the polypropylene company business increased as product prices improved and energy costs decreased. We saw lower demand from the construction and electronics markets, while demand from the automotive markets gained momentum during the quarter. We expect demand in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter across most APS businesses. Typical third quarter downtime at OEMs will offset some of the automotive production gains we have seen in the first half of 2023 in Europe and North America. Our number 1 priority in APS is to restore service levels to our customers and restore growth in the business. I'm happy to report that we have restored our service levels, and we're making good progress in refilling our growth pipeline. APS has a lot of project-based business and our growth pipeline depends on winning a spot on the next automotive platform launch with the next color design. One KPI that we track is the number of color and concentrate request we service. In Europe, the number of requests increased by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter relative to our performance in the second half of 2022. We still have a long path to complete our transformation, but our team is making tangible progress in delivering improved results. In early July, we completed our acquisition of the Mepol Group, a manufacturer of recycled high-performing technical compounds located in Italy and Poland. Mepol's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our strategy to be the leader in providing sustainable solutions for our customers. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segments on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $79 million reflected higher licensing revenue and lower catalyst volumes. In the third quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will moderately improve. As a result, we estimate that the third quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the quarterly results seen in the first 3 quarters of 2022. As discussed in the previous earnings call, we expect that LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology will be a key enabler for scaling up our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant in Cologne, Germany is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and announced an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year. Please turn to Slide 20 and I will discuss the market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that the challenging market conditions of the second quarter will continue for the remainder of the year. And the America's fundamental demand is stopped and we see cautious buying from our customers and consumers. Margins are expected to be pressured by near-term volatility in feedstock costs and new capacity. The potential for energy cost volatility and associated consumer caution looms over the European markets, despite moderation in feedstock and energy costs relative to 2022. In China, strength in Consumer Services has not been sufficient to offset slow recovery in durable goods, infrastructure and export activity. Markets are not reflecting much benefit from the initial stimulus measures. Demand for consumer packaging is stable, supported by the service industries. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels cautiously low. Building and construction markets are relatively flat with benefits from new housing starts offset by reduced sales and maintenance for existing homes as owners resist trading into higher mortgage rates. We're watchful for tailwinds in the United States from stimulus enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act, to be part of the infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act. Demand from automotive market seems to be gaining momentum. However, there may be some headwinds from the typical downtime at OEMs in the third quarter. Oxyfuels and refining markets continue to see stable demand as refined product inventories remain low. At LyondellBasell, we optimize our well-positioned assets across the world. We will continue to align our operating rates with market demand and steered through all stages of the business cycle. Now let me summarize our second quarter outlook and our long-term strategy for our company with Slide 21. Our second quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value to our new strategy despite challenging markets. Margins for our O&P businesses moderately improved amid tipid demand. Although lower than the first quarter, our oxyfuels and refining margins remained above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand. Cash generation in the second quarter was outstanding with $1.3 billion in cash from operations and an impressive cash conversion of 103% over the past 4 quarters. We returned $508 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate soft demands and additional polyolefins capacity in North America and Asia will lead to further margin compression. We expect LyondellBasell's third quarter EBITDA will be mid-teens to mid-20 percentage points lower than the second quarter. We remain watchful for near-term risks and opportunities across sectors and geographies. At our Capital Markets Day in March, we shared our excitement around our new forward strategy. And during the call today, we provided updates on our progress to capture incremental value across the 3 pillars of the strategy. I want to emphasize that we are not allowing current conditions to slow us down. Our value enhancement program has generated incredible energy and enthusiasm across our workforce, from frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers developing innovative solutions to sales and support teams serving our customers around the world. LyondellBasell VEP is unlocking value at an accelerating pace. We're making steady progress on our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Just taking a step back on Slide 14. You had a pretty solid 2Q in the Americas. But at the same time, as you've been consistently highlighting, there's been a lot of volatility in NGL pricing, there's going to be a difference in operating rates in the second half. There's a little bit of a choppy macro picture. Just when we're thinking about integrated olefin margins, just how should we be thinking about the run rate for the second half and in 2024, just want to take a look at the current dynamics? And then any comments on how you expect this to eventually inflect and improve, hopefully, next year. Ken Lane : Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Like we have said in the remarks that we made, we do expect it to be volatile. So the good news is we've seen NGL prices come down. NAV was really peaking in July, but we do see that coming off here in August, but it did have an impact in July. That's not going to continue. The inventory levels for NGLs are still very healthy and production is growing. So overall, we expect that we're going to see advantages with NGL production here in the U.S., especially with ethane. Now having said that, we still do have a lot of new supply that's coming into the market. And at the end of the second quarter, we saw prices in the Americas coming down and that's going to continue into the third quarter, let's say, it's going to carry into the third quarter. We've seen some green shoots in the export market. So I think we're kind of bouncing along the bottom here. But it's just going to support that theme of continued volatility going forward. What I would expect is that we're going to see that normal seasonality going into the fourth quarter, some weakness on volumes. Q1 will typically be a little bit better. And then when we get into the second half of next year is when I expect to start to see things really improve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Duffy Fischer : Question around the export split versus sales in North America. So if you would -- maybe 3 parts. So where are you guys on that split? Where do you think the U.S. industry is and then when you think about the 3 plants that are going to start up or are in the process of starting up, where do you think their split will be in their first year of operations? Peter Vanacker : That's a very good question, Duffy. Let me hand it over to Ken on the olefins and polyolefins side. Ken Lane : Duffy. Yes, so listen, we have traditionally been lower in terms of a percentage for exports in our portfolio, and you see that this year. Now some of that as well is driven by the turnaround that we've had in the first half of the year. We've got some of our capacity down right now in the Midwest. So we've been a little bit lower on the export sales in the first half of the year. As an industry, the Americas or the U.S. typically is exporting somewhere around 35% to 40% of the capacity. Normally, when these new assets come online, you're looking at them exporting significantly above that level for the first year or so as they work their way into the market. But I don't see any change in the midterm around the industry being at that 40% level of exports, but it's always our goal to find the highest value for our products. And that is in the domestic market. So our focus is on serving the customers here and building out a portfolio that is more resilient by supplying domestic. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes. Is e-cracker concept that you're pursuing, is that fair to assume that this would require a complete rebuild and not a retrofit. And if so, how do you look at the economics of that approach versus these multiple hydros that you have at your refinery that you could produce renewable map, particularly if the DOE goes along with your hydrogen hub proposal. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Steve. Very good question that you're asking. I mean what we are doing here together with our partners is, first of all, developing the technology further into, let's call it, a semi industrial scale. So this is not replacing, but it is feeding into a cracker. Next to that, of course, we are following different other avenues in order to prepare ourselves, I mean, for more renewable hydrocarbons. And here, that's what we are looking at, at the refinery and how can we leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydro crackers that we have. So there will not be one solution fits all is the key message, but we are playing, let's say, very broadly, being technology agnostic, and investing in the different types of technologies that eventually where we then would decide to invest in those technologies on an industrial scale. We're talking about 2013 plus in my view. Then, of course, there can be different solutions depending on where you are in the world. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Steve Richardson : I was wondering if you could ask on APS, Torkel. I appreciate the update. I was wondering if you could maybe remind us of some of your longer-term goals in terms of restoring profitability. It sounds like you're making some good inroads. And then also I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about more if acquisitions should be expected to be persistent part of the outlook there or if this is something unique. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you. So as we communicated, our target is to get the business to what we believe is very feasible that the $0.5 billion earnings by 2027. And that's the plan that we have embarked on. And I have to say we are at the current moment right as I expect us to be. I've led multiple business transformations, and this is where I expect us to be at this time. So if you look at our earnings performance, I think fourth quarter of last year was the bottom, and we have then 2 months behind us where we are gradually improving it, but it is a multi-year effort for us and we're feeling the growth pipeline, as I mentioned, is our number 1 priority, and we're making good progress, but that also takes time. But it is our focus. In terms of acquisitions, the Mepol, I think, was an acquisition that perfectly fit in, but there is nothing else that we have that we are in that sort of category for our space at the moment. Peter Vanacker : And here -- it's Peter. I mean just to add to that, I mean, in terms of the acquisitions, I mean, one needs to look at the Mepol acquisition, being at the boundary, the interface between circular and low-carbon solutions and then the APS business with the compounding. So Mepol has a very strong mechanical recycling position in those different markets, and that's what made it so attractive for us to do that acquisition. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Just wanted to follow up on your outlook for O&P margins across both North America and EIA. So it calls -- it looks like you're calling for double-digit declines in your profitability in Q3 sequentially from Q2. Can you just walk us through some of those mechanics? I know that we had the $0.03 decline in June on polyethylene. Are you looking for further declines in Q3? And just wondering, given the feedstock volatility there as well and then the recent decline in ethane prices, or is it continued weakness in volume? Or is it a little bit of both? Or maybe just walk us through some of the tanks. Peter Vanacker : Yes. Maybe first of all, let me repeat what has been said in the prepared remarks is that we have an outlook, I mean, for Q3, which we believe will be mid mid-double digits, so mid-teens to mid-20s, lower in terms of EBITDA compared to [indiscernible] Q2. And why that relatively broad range still because as you know, I mean, we have a very broad portfolio of different products. And we've seen a bit of improvements in the refinery markets. On the one hand side, we continue to believe, I mean, that we will have strong oxyfuel margins as Kim mentioned in the prepared remarks. But then, of course, I mean, with the volatility that you see in the olefins and polyolefins markets and then China still not being back as it should be at this point in time right now. So we will then, of course, fine-tune that towards more at the end of the quarter. When you Michael will speak on a conference, and then we'll give a further update on where we are standing, I mean, in that quarter. So with that, I mean, on the O&P maybe answer that question as well. I mean, Ken, if you can give some additional? Ken Lane : Yes, like I had said previously, we're looking at the feedstock kind of peaked in July. So that definitely is going to hurt us versus Q2, if you think about it sequentially. Also, like I said, with prices coming down in the U.S. at the end of Q2, that's carried into Q3, so both of those are going to be headwinds. Then there is some volume component to that. Q2 is normally our peak fall in terms of seasonality and in Q3, especially in Europe, in the summer months, you start to see the volume slow down. So we will have some volume slowdown in Q3 as well. Overall, I expect that we are, like I said, bumping along here on margins in Q3 in terms of being at the bottom. Michael McMurray : And then what I would remind investors is that the fourth quarter is typically seasonally weak to the third. Just as a reminder. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Government in China recently included the plastics industry, specifically in their economic support program, just very recently. Do you have any insight into how the support actually is implemented in practice. It sounds like you haven't seen much benefit so far. But -- just any color on specific program maybe that you have would be helpful -- Peter Vanacker : Yes, Aleksey, I mean, we have seen a couple of areas where that eventually could have an impact. But at this point in time, it's too premature to say, I mean how much that impact will be. Our people, as you know, they are on the ground, I mean, following that. There seems to talks around, I mean, automotive industry, talks about white goods industry, but too premature, I mean, to say because we need -- we've seen a couple of these initiatives so far, but we are rather in a wait-and-see position now and ready. I mean, if the market would see, I mean, an uptick because all the initiatives so far have not had the impact as we would have hoped despite the fact, I mean, that the saving rates of individuals is extremely high, I mean, in China. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : I had a question on I&D. You noted in your slide that you're anticipating a $20 million headwind in 3Q from turnarounds, but also you indicated that you're shutting down 2 PO/SM plants for both the months of July and August, I assume that that's not included in that guide. So I'm just curious what sort of financial impact we should be anticipating with the shutdowns of the PO/SM facilities and are you awaiting a return in demand before you bring those facilities back up? Any more color there would be very helpful. Peter Vanacker : Yes. Very good question, Frank. And of course, I mean, like we have done last year as well. We don't call this, let's say, cost savings, but I mean, we call this, I mean, we look at what is happening in the marketplace. You know that with our PO/TBA capacities and especially the new one that we have rather seen successfully. We have the lowest cost and also lowest carbon footprints, propylene upsides in the world. So it's clear, I mean, that the PO/SM facilities are more kind of playing a role of a swing capacity. So with that, I will hand over to Kim to give more details. KimFoley : Frank. Thank you, Peter. Let me just add a little bit more color, as Peter alluded to, when we provide the guidance, the guidance was really to help investors understand the difference of bringing on this new PO/TBA capacity and relative to the other capacity that we would be taking offline for maintenance. And we really looked at that from the PO/TBA technology. So that you can see both the PO impacts as well as the oxyfuel impacts because they're almost offsetting, which is what you see in the guidelines. We talked about a 50% run rate for the new plant versus the maintenance of the other assets. So when you ask about what's the impact of the PO/SM market or assets going down, I think the way to think about it is where is styrene today. Styrene is oversupplied, it's changing month-to-month on very, very thin margins. So what -- how I would answer your question, Frank, is I don't think there is an impact based on PO demand of those plants idling at this point in time based on the durable demand for polyurethanes regionally as well as globally. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Question within your wide range of EBITDA guidance, you have sort of a single point targets for operating rates. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about operating rates given they fluctuated a fair amount a lot more than normal over the past 12 months. And so what are you solving for with those operating rates versus the profitability you're seeing? Michael McMurray : It's pretty simple, Vincent. We're matching supply to demand. I wouldn't say it any other way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Mike Leithead : Question on O&P EAI. Historically, if I look back, this business did about $1 billion or more of annual EBITDA. And now it seems like profitability is likely going to be a bit below that for some time, just given energy dynamics and some of the new supply that's coming on in Asia. So just if we take a step back, how are you thinking long term about the competitiveness and profitability of your assets there? Peter Vanacker : Yes, Ken, I mean, if you can take that question? Ken Lane : Yes. So listen, of course, the headwinds in the European business with energy like everybody else has. And we're focused on generating the highest value from those assets because there are things that we can do through our VEP program that still does generate good value from a margin standpoint. We've seen probably the biggest headwind in Europe around demand. So volume is down pretty significantly year-over-year. As you can imagine, the whole inflation equation has hit the consumer very hard in Europe. So we believe we've got good competitive assets there. But of course, we're operating at a very difficult market. We're going to look for ways to continue to improve the value that we can get from those assets. In the longer term, we're always looking at our portfolio, and we'll continue to do so and make sure that we have the most competitive position that we can with reasonable amounts of capital that we would have to deploy there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Matthew Blair : I had a question on just the longer-term PE outlook. Some of the consultants are showing global capacity growth in about the 2.5% range for 2024 through 2026, which, as you know, is about half of what we've seen recently. And so my question is, do you -- what are your expectations? Do you believe this forecast? Do you think this number will creep up? Or is it too late to really see any meaningful increase in like the 2024 and 2025 numbers, specifically. Peter Vanacker : Well, Matthew, I mean, normally, you have quite a good visibility. I mean, with the announcements of capacity increases. So -- and that visibility in our industry is normally around what, 4, 5 years, I mean, down the road. I would be very surprised, I mean, if there would certainly be additional capacities that come on stream. I mean, within that period that have not been announced because that's not how the industry is working. I mean, Ken, with regards, I mean, to the announcements now as the supply and demand. Ken Lane : I -- the only thing I would add to that, Peter, is we have seen some projects starting to slow down, right? So we are hearing about that in the market. And look, I'll remind you, too, we always get into these down cycles, and it happens every time. And it feels like you're going to be here forever but there will be capacity that also comes out of the market. So yes, there are some additions that are going to come. And some of those are going to make sense depending on their feedstock position and the region that they're in, but there are going to be some capacities that come out. It takes a couple of years for that to happen, but that's how the cycle works. So in the short term, I don't expect there to be any significant change in capacity coming on. But in the midterm, I do think you're going to see some projects start to be slowed down. Peter Vanacker : And then if you look at it, I mean, from the demand side, if you look into the history, than with the financial crisis 2008 and 2009, then certainly in 2009 and 2010, you had a big recovery. So growth was higher than it normally is, let's say, over the cycle, let's say, around, I mean, 4% per year. And the same we've seen, I mean also with the pandemic, I mean, pandemic in 2021. During the second year, you saw a recovery with -- when you compare that to 2020. So I mean, we continue to be just looking, I mean, from a historic point of view. We have a consumer behavior. It could very well be that also then we see in the future that there's going to be higher demand compared to, I mean, to the average over the cycle demand growth of about 4% per year on polyethylene. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John Roberts : Will the delay in closing the refinery pushback the time frame to achieve the $1 billion EBITDA from circular plastics? I assume you're going to be later in converting some of the gasifiers and so forth at the location. Peter Vanacker : The clear answer on that is, John, no. It's not. I mean, our target remains, I mean unchanged in the circular and low-carbon solutions business as we have communicated on the Capital Markets Day and we have been evaluating that option, obviously, exactly if you did our Capital Markets Day, so it was on the radar screen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : I think a couple of years ago, in Advanced Polymer Solutions, you were earning about $300 million. And today, guess the quarterly run rate is about $1 billion, and maybe you're making $10 million in EBIT. What happened to that business? And in your forecast of $500 million in EBITDA from circular polymers, what EBITDA margin do you expect on that? Or what EBITDA margin does that number still -- Torkel Rhenman : Thank you for the question. On the APS, I covered when we had the Capital Markets Day, I think we've really lost the focus on the business and our customers when we went through the integration. And we took out a lot of cost and synergy but this is a business that really requires this customer centricity. It's a project-based business. You have to have a really good growth pipeline and a very, very good service level and that's the recognition that I think from the whole integration that we made some mistakes and we really have not put together this transformation plan to deliver what this business can perform. And that's the journey that we're on. And I'm confident that we're going to deliver on it. We're making good progress. But it is a transformation, it will take up years. Michael McMurray : And then Jeff, it's Michael. One of the things that I'd add, if you're looking at current year results versus historic results, remember, at the start of this year, we removed 2 relatively significant businesses from the APS segment and put it back in O&P. So that's not an apples-to-apples comparison if you're looking at this year versus history, just as a reminder. Peter Vanacker : And to your question, I mean, on the circular business, Jeff. I mean the $500 million in -- by 2027 and then the $1 billion by 2030. When we talked about that on the Capital Markets Day, you know that we are talking about 2 million tons of target by 2030. The margins that we talked about, I mean, you can do the back of the [indiscernible] Calculation pretty much is incremental EBITDA on top of the EBITDA that we normally make, I mean, in our crackers. So it gives you a bit of guidance also here. I must say, I mean we're -- we look at the margins that we are creating, I mean, today with that business, you know that since we started the business, we have been able, I mean, to grow the business quite substantially. Of course, albeit, I mean, still at a low level compared to the overall volumes that we are having in the polyolefins. We see that the margins that we can capture or substantially higher than what we have said, I mean, at the Capital Markets Day. And again, it's a separate business that is being created. I keep repeating that. Like I said at the Capital Markets Day, with its own supply and demand that has its own value-based pricing mechanisms that we are positioning in the marketplace. So this is not a market where you have a polyolefin plus a premium type of approach. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Just wanted to revisit the earlier question around polyethylene exports out of the U.S. Look, I mean, a lot of this capacity that's been coming online in the U.S. has been with an eye to the export markets. And as you guys and others have talked about, the European market isn't looking great. Asia hasn't rebounded the way one would have expected it to. So I mean, are you seeing a scenario where some of that product that was meant for the export market isn't making its way to the export markets and potentially is putting further downward pressure on PE pricing in the U.S.? Peter Vanacker : One of the things, Hassan, that we have seen already since the end of last year, and this has maybe also a bit to do, I mean, with some learnings out of running a business like that in a pandemic environment, is that there has been substantially more disciplined in the marketplace. So just like we, as a leader in the industry, have reduced, I mean, the output instead of pushing products into the market. Others have done, I mean, the same thing. So you see a change, in my view, in terms of behavior compared, I mean, to the history. Ken, anything you want to add? Ken Lane : I completely agree with that. And like I had mentioned before, there will be headwinds with this capacity coming on. There always is. But the capacity comes on one time and then you feel it and the market will adjust to that. I also said earlier, we're seeing some strength in some of the export markets, especially going south. So we're starting to see some growth in some markets like Brazil that's going to help absorb some of that capacity. So I'm not any more concerned about it now than I was 6 months ago. Southeast Asia is even looking a little bit better. We've seen that trend over the last couple of months. So the markets are going to absorb it over time. And like Peter said and Michael had said, we'll adjust our operating rates to optimize cash. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. Peter Vanacker : Okay. Thank you very much. As usual, very thoughtful questions. We're looking forward to sharing the updates on our progress towards unlocking additional value, of course, over the coming months and we wish you all a great weekend. And as usual, stay safe. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Good day, everybody, and thank you all for joining today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results, while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today until November 27, by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13739196. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates & Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results. Starting with Slide 3. We have three key messages for today's call. First, LyondellBasell continues to generate resilient results despite challenging market conditions. Our team delivered exceptional cash conversion during the quarter. And our balanced approach to capital deployment was on full display, as we repaid maturing bonds, funded investments to grow and maintain our assets and rewarded shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, thanks to great teamwork, we were able to bolster the cash on our balance sheet. Secondly, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy. You will recall that our strategy is built on three pillars. The first pillar reflects our commitment to actively grow and upgrade the core businesses that are aligned with our long-term strategy. We are growing our Intermediates & Derivatives segment through the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities, the largest single train propylene oxide plant in the world. In the third quarter, extremely strong margins for oxyfuels produced from our PO/TBA assets contributed to a record-setting quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Kim will provide more details on this in a few minutes. The other half of growing and upgrading our core involve difficult decisions about businesses and assets that do not really fit with our long-term direction. In September, we announced our intent to close one of our two polypropylene production units in Brindisi, Italy. And our plans to exit the refining business and transform the site are very well known. These actions are examples of how the pillars of our strategy reinforce each other. We're actively managing our business portfolio to reallocate resources toward assets and businesses that support the growth of our core, while building the second pillar of our strategy, a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. We continue to make good progress in this area, producing and marketing over 250,000 ton-site of recycled or renewable-based polymers since 2019. As Jim Seward and Yvonne van der Laan discussed in our MoReTec webinar last month, we're looking forward to a final investment decision later this quarter on our first commercial advanced catalytic recycling plant in Germany. And we are not sitting still, in just the past few weeks, we've announced joint ventures in two different Dutch plastic waste recycling companies, a stake in a circular plastic venture capital fund and a joint venture in infrastructure and recycled plastic feedstock\u2019s that support our plans for an integrated circular and low-carbon solutions here in Houston and also a renewable electricity supply agreement in Spain. Our value enhancement program aligns with the third pillar of our strategy, stepping up our performance and culture. I am pleased to announce that our VEP is on track to exceed our target for $200 million in recurring annual EBITDA run rate by the end of 2023. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our VEP target by $50 million, from our initial target of $150 million that we announced at our Capital Markets Day in March. The new phone value unlocked by the VEP supports our investments to grow our core, while building a profitable and game-changing circular and low-carbon solutions business. My third key message is that LyondellBasell's focused strategy is strengthening our business portfolio to ensure our company is well positioned to capture value today and into the future. Our track record of effective cost management, operational excellence and innovation all provide competitive advantages. With a sharper focus on core businesses that benefit from leading positions in growing markets with attractive returns, we can maximize the impact of these competitive advantages. I hope you share our excitement for the future of LyondellBasell. Let's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Safe operations are fundamental to our core values and provide the cornerstone for our future success. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.14, which means that our safety performance remains above the top 75th percentile for our industry. I want to congratulate our team for their outstanding safety performance. Let's turn to Slide 5 and summarize our financial results. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation from our well positioned and diverse portfolio. Earnings were $2.46 per share. EBITDA was $1.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash from operating activities was $1.7 billion, with $7 billion of available liquidity. Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of efficient cash conversion that supports our investment-grade balance sheet and strong shareholder returns. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $5 billion of cash from operating activities. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $2.8 billion. Our team efficiently converted 102% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months.  Let's continue with Slide 7 and review the details of our capital deployment during the third quarter. LyondellBasell remains committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation that supports investment in our long-term strategy, while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the third quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.7 billion in cash from operating activities. Robust cash conversion, comfortably covered capital expenditures, paid down maturing bonds, and enabled a return of $448 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  As Peter mentioned, our team is focused on growing and upgrading our core businesses while actively managing our portfolio with the completion of our new PO/TBA assets, our capital expenditures are now focused on investments in building a profitable circular and low carbon solutions business and smaller profit generating projects as well as maintaining safe and reliable operations across our existing asset base.  I would now like to provide a brief overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 8. LyondellBasell business portfolio delivered $1.4 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Our results reflected exceptional oxyfuel margins that fueled record quarterly EBITDA in I&D offset by lower margins from both O&P segments. Results in our olefins and polyolefin businesses were pressured by higher feedstock cost, new industry capacity and very challenging conditions in European markets.  In our last earnings call, we shared our expectation that third quarter EBITDA would decline from second quarter results. Subsequent events led to results that exceeded our expectations, primarily in our I&D segment. During August and into September, unplanned downtime at several assets across the U.S. Gulf Coast. Oxyfuels industry triggered a significant improvement in margins that increased I&D EBITDA by 50% relative to the second quarter. Our third quarter EBITDA for the company's did declined slightly, but clearly exceeded the upper end of our expectations.  We continue to align our operating rates with market demand to optimize working capital. During the fourth quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets, 75% for our European olefins and polyolefin and 70% for intermediates and derivative assets.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Ken Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 9, with the performance of our olefins and polyolefin Americas segment. Third quarter O&P America's EBITDA was $504 million. Integrated polyethylene margins were pressured by higher feedstock costs and continued oversupply. Global polyethylene trade flows appeared to be slowly normalizing toward pre pandemic conditions. Increasing export prices and volumes helped to support U.S. polyethylene contract price increases in both August and September.  In the fourth quarter, we expect strengthening polyethylene pricing supported by stable domestic volume and continued export strength. We also expect potential headwinds from volatile feedstock and energy costs.  U.S. polyethylene market as well supplied with recent capacity additions entering the market. We remain focused on our disciplined approach to match LyondellBasell's operating rates with market demand. Roughly two-thirds of LyondellBasell\u2019s North America polyethylene capacity is high density polyethylene. So we are pleased to see high density polyethylene inventories falling across the industry during September.  In support of our growth in circular and low carbon solutions, we announced the venture capital investment in Lombard Odier Plastic Circularity Fund. The fund aims to reduce pollution from plastics by investing in companies offering innovative solutions to improve the collection, sorting and recycling of plastic waste. This fund is another example of our comprehensive engagement and collaboration across the value chain to increase the availability of recycled feed stocks.  Just this week, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture between Agilyx, ExxonMobil and LyondellBasell to accelerate the development of a nationwide circular economy for plastics. The collaboration aims to capture more plastic waste from landfills and provide infrastructure and recycle materials at scale in support of our plans to build an integrated circular and low carbon solutions hub in the Houston area.  Please turn to Slide 10, as we review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins, Europe, Asia and international segment. In the third quarter, weak demand continued oversupply and higher naphtha costs impacted our European margins, resulting in an EBITDA loss of $45 million. As we approach year in, we expect European markets remain challenging, with weak demand that will likely persist. We anticipate modest polymer price increases, offsetting higher feedstock and energy costs. The slow but gradual return of Chinese demand seems to be providing some tailwinds for normalizing global trade flows.  Finally, we took several steps during the quarter to advance our long term strategy. As part of our goal to improve our focus on core assets and businesses, we made the difficult decision to close one of our two polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We also announced the acquisition of 50% stakes in two different Dutch recycling companies, Stiphout and De Paauw Sustainable Resources. Both companies are involved in the sourcing and processing of plastic packaging waste, and support our efforts to build scale by expanding the production of our circular and recovered products. In line with our sustainability goals, we signed a renewable power purchase agreement for 149 megawatts of solar electricity generation capacity in Spain. With this LyondellBasell has rapidly achieved 78% of our 2030 target for renewable electricity with over 1.1 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity under agreements. I would like to recognize our teams for their quick and decisive actions to advance our strategy.  Now I will turn the call over to Kim. Kim Foley : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 11 as we look at the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Exceptional oxyfuel margins resulted in record third quarter segment EBITDA of $708 million. During the quarter, unplanned industry downtime for oxyfuels production on the U.S. Gulf Coast led to higher blend premiums for oxyfuels relative to gasoline. When coupled with higher crude oil prices and relatively low cost for butane raw materials, oxyfuel margins expanded significantly in North America and Europe. The outstanding performance of our oxyfuels business during the third quarter is an example of how our diverse global business portfolio is capable of providing resilient results through market cycles. With our new PO/TBA asset, LyondellBasell's global oxyfuels capacity is now as large as our North American polyethylene capacity, highlighting the diversity of our growing portfolio. In our propylene oxide and derivatives business, additional volumes from the new PO/TBA asset were largely offset by the planned idling of two POSM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. These actions reflect our disciplined approach to match production rates with the demands during challenging market conditions. Looking ahead, we expect the end of summer driving season and the higher butane costs will cause oxyfuel margins to moderate towards levels seen in the first half of 2023. In line with our guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the fourth quarter at two of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately 70% capacity in the fourth quarter. In September, we expanded the range of our sustainable offerings with the launch of our +LC brand of low-carbon solutions. These products are sourced from recycled and renewable feedstock\u2019s and offer our customers a solution for meeting their greenhouse gas emissions targets with propylene oxide, styrene and other products that provide a lower carbon footprint than fossil-based alternatives. Please turn to Slide 12, and let's review the progress of our new PO/TBA asset. As Peter mentioned earlier, the first pillar of our strategy is to grow and upgrade our core by investing in businesses that fit our long-term strategy. Our new PO/TBA asset in Houston, Texas is a key part of that growth. This facility is the world's largest single-train asset increasing LyondellBasell's global propylene oxide and oxyfuels capacities by more than 35%. Furthermore, we believe that PO/TBA technologies are highly advantaged relative to other widely used propylene oxide technologies. By our analysis, PO/TBA technologies had the lowest operating cost and the lowest carbon footprint for producing propylene oxide. And our strategically located U.S. Gulf Coast assets benefit from the shale advantaged butane and propylene feedstocks. During the commissioning and the start-up of these assets, we achieved more than 4 million man hours of work without a recordable injury. This relentless focus on safety and the associated attention to detail is a key part of our success. Within two months of the plant start-up, we completed the technical acceptance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. In 2023, the ramp-up in our new capacity will be largely offset by planned maintenance at our existing PO/TBA assets, but we expect to see more meaningful volume contribution from the new PO/TBA asset in 2024 and beyond as the demand for durable goods return. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones and look forward to their continued success. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $105 million. Modest improvements in the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spread were offset by a mark-to-market impact from a distillate hedging program. As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we will occasionally use derivatives to hedge commercial or financial risks. During the third quarter, refinery cracks, particularly distillate cracks, were highly favorable relative to historical levels. And we took the opportunity to lock in attractive margins for a portion of our refinery output through 2024. Distillate cracks in September outperformed our expectations, resulting in mark-to-market losses for our distillate hedging program. In the near term, we expect seasonally slower demand for refined products and the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to decrease. Currently, we are executing planned maintenance on our catalytic cracker, with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million in the fourth quarter. We expect crude throughputs at the refinery to be approximately 80% of capacity in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to the safe operation of these assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025, with a focus on high reliability, as we develop new projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solutions growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Let's review the third quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 14. Third quarter EBITDA was $18 million. Margins decreased mostly due to the sales mix for the quarter and lower demand. This was partially offset by incremental volumes from our metal acquisition completed in July. In the fourth quarter, we expect demand to be similar to the third quarter across most APS businesses. With service levels to our customers now restored, our team is highly focused on refilling the growth pipeline for our business. And we are making good progress in increasing the number of sustainable solutions for our customers with high-performing recycled technical compounds from our newly acquired metal assets and product developments from across our existing asset footprint. Our expectations for the fourth quarter of this year are modest, but we look forward to steady improvement during 2024, as the projects in our growth pipeline begin to mature and make their way to the bottom line as we work towards the goals we discussed at our Capital Markets Day last March. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA of $146 million reflected higher licensing revenue and improved catalyst results. In the fourth quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will be unusually low, and catalyst volumes will decrease. As a result, we estimate that full year 2023 technology segment EBITDA will be approximately $30 million lower than full year 2022. As discussed in the beginning of this call, we are targeting a final investment decision for a commercial scale plant using our MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology before the end of this year, and hope to share more details in our fourth quarter telephone conference. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the near-term market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that challenging market conditions will persist through the remainder of the year and into 2024. In addition, we expect additional pressures from typical fourth quarter seasonality associated with holidays and year-end inventory management. In the Americas, pricing is expected to be supported by increased polyethylene exports and stable demand. Integrated polyethylene margins will likely be constrained by higher feedstock costs and new market capacity. We expect that European markets will remain highly challenged. Weak market demand, coupled with rising feedstock and energy costs, are likely to continue to compress margins. In China, markets are slowly improving, and targeted stimulus initiatives seem to be providing some limited benefits. In our end markets, demand for consumer packaging is slow but steady, supported by the consumer and industrial packaging markets. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels low. Building and construction markets are slow, but we're watchful for potential benefits in the United States, enabled by stimulus from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips & Science Act. We expect demand from automotive production will continue to gain momentum. The UAW strike has not yet materially affected our results. Oxyfuel margins are expected to remain well above historical averages, but declined from third quarter records to a level similar to the first half of 2023. Distillate inventories are expected to remain on the low end of seasonal averages and gasoline inventories have risen with the end of the summer driving season. We will continue to optimize our operating rates to remain in step with market demand. Now let me summarize the third quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy for the company with Slide 17. Exceptional oxyfuels margins enabled record results from our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. O&P margins were pressured by higher feedstock costs and new industry capacity, amid stable but soft demand. Cash generation was outstanding, with $1.7 billion in cash from operations, which enabled us to return approximately $450 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as part of our balanced capital allocation framework. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate seasonally softer demand across our businesses, but we remain confident in our proven ability to navigate challenging markets and deliver results. Our team will continue to remain focused on advancing value creation through the three pillars of our long-term strategy. Our third quarter results demonstrate the benefits from growing our core with new capacity from our PO/TBA assets, and we are upgrading our business portfolio by improving our focus on this core. We are reallocating resources away from noncore assets and businesses. At the same time, we are rapidly building a comprehensive business model to support the profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business, where LyondellBasell benefits from participation up and down the value chain. And we are transforming our performance and culture to embrace a comprehensive approach to value creation. Our value enhancement program is unlocking value at an accelerating pace. And I am confident we will exceed our 2023 recurring annual EBITDA exit run rate target of $200 million. We are laser-focused in our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. With that, we are now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. A two-part question. Can you talk about profitability of your Bora joint venture in China? How that's changed through the course of the third quarter and into the fourth? And I think in the quarter, you bought back a minimal number of shares. Do you have a weighting between dividends and share repurchase that you think about? Or why was the share repurchase so small? Peter Vanacker : Great. Thank you, Jeff, for your questions. I mean, situation pretty much on Bora has not changed compared to the previous quarters. We continue to run at minimum capacity. Ken, do you want to add something? Ken Lane : Yes. I would just say that we did have a turnaround that impacted the asset in the third quarter, Jeff. But what we are seeing is signs of some domestic growth in the market there, which is encouraging. However, the growth rate is still not where we needed to be to absorb all of the new capacity. But that asset is approaching breakeven levels of EBITDA, which is great to see, but still a very challenging market in China. Jeff Zekauskas : And with regards to our capital allocation strategy, also here, nothing has changed. I mean, with regards into the share buybacks, Michael? Michael McMurray : No, sure, Jeff. So what I would say is that our capital allocation priorities remain fundamentally unchanged. I think really pleased with our cash flow performance this year and this quarter, in particular. I think really good execution. Pleased with the amount of working capital that we're able to take out of operations this quarter as well. And then again, I said looking forward, our commitments to shareholders remain intact. I think this has been demonstrated by our previous actions. You know that we communicated a 70% payout target for free cash flow, that stands. That said, we don't put capital allocation on autopilot. We have a point of view. And then clearly, given all the risks and uncertainties as we sit here today, we're being a little bit more cautious in the near term. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. You guys had a record quarter in I&D, with strong oxyfuels, and now the PO/TBA plant is online. Maybe there's still some weakness in derivatives, but how should we think about margin set up into 2024 across each of the chains? And what sort of ramp up in EBITDA should we see from the PO/TBA plant as it gets to nameplate? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, Patrick. Very good question. Maybe let me, first of all, highlight, again that, of course, with a very successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant, the capacity mix in North America has, of course, changed. I mean, on one hand side, we have about 4.1 million tons of PE capacity in North America. And in oxyfuels, we have a global capacity now of 4.4 million tons. So I think that's important also to highlight that with that successful investment, our portfolio mix has, I mean, successfully changed. So with that, Kim, you want to say something around your outlook, I mean, for oxyfuel margins? Kim Foley : Absolutely. Let me start by taking us back to Capital Markets Day. I think what we said then is mid-cycle margins for the cycle would produce an I&D EBITDA segment of about 1.6. So if you think about the new plant as an incremental $450 million, we're just north of $2 billion. Short term, this segment is challenged by weak, durable demand and capacity oversupply, which impacts both volume and margin in our current environment. But on the positive side, we continue to see really strong demand for oxyfuels. Margins are above historical levels. So as we discussed in Capital Markets Day, again, it's this diversity of this segment, combined with our global low-cost asset footprint that provides positive EBITDA through the cycle. Peter Vanacker : The team has done quite a lot of very good work as well in the global supply chain management by building up more flexibility in global supply chain and management on oxyfuels as well as on POs. So that will also help in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Peter, you're having very good success with the Value Enhancement Program. What's the potential this program longer term? Can you get to $1 billion high run rate, do you think, in the '25 and beyond time frame? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, David, for your question. I'm actually very, very pleased with how the LyondellBasell team has embraced the value enhancement program. I mean I've done these programs in the past at other companies, and it took longer. We have about 4,000 or 5,000 people now involved. We just went to Phase E in having smaller sites that have now rolled out the Value Enhancement Program, also with a huge amount of success. As we said, I mean, our original target was first year, 150 million exit run rate EBITDA. We increased it to 200 million. Today, we actually said we're going to exceed that 200 million. We haven't changed our 750 million target. But as we have said in the past, I mean, this is not a project. It becomes part of the DNA. So it doesn't have a beginning and an end. So we can definitely say that it's not going to stop at 750 million as a consequence. So we will be able to capture more value. And we see that already happening because the sites that were involved in the first phase, they have already started going again, I mean, through new initiatives, new brainstorming sessions that they have captured. So we already start building up that certain, let's say, that first-level sites already have a new group of projects, new projects identified, I mean, to continue to increase value and creation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. What would you put the probability that your refinery is selected as the DOE-funded hydrogen hub for Texas? And if it is, would that influence your choice of where to put the MoReTec process? And would it also potentially lead you to operate the hydro treaters and hydrocrackers longer than that first quarter of 2025 to keep them functional for longer-term utility and renewable fuels? Peter Vanacker : Thanks, Steve. Good question. I mean, of course, we were very pleased that amongst the seven projects that have been announced to receive funding, that the Houston High Velocity project has been included in that. Our project that we have on HROs, our refinery, is part of that high velocity. So we get very good support. That's great. Of course, we continue to develop that project. There's still a lot of steps, I mean, that need to be taken until we are at investment decisions. But it gives, of course, quite a lot of support already to move them into the next step. Having said that, of course, in the transformation of our Houston refinery, we have multiple projects that we are currently looking at. One of those projects is the upgrading of plastic oil that would come out of our MoReTec 2 investment. Remember, MoReTec 1 is the colon hub. MoReTec 2 will be much larger than MoReTec 1. And here, we are looking at the Houston hub. So MoReTec 2 investment in Houston, leveraging upon our equipment like hydro treaters that we have in Houston to upgrade that plastic oil and then having the interconnection through our pipelines with our channel view steam crackers. That's the second project.  Third project that we are looking at is leveraging upon those hydro treaters, to see if we can produce renewable hydrocarbons in the hydro treaters that again would leverage upon feeding them into the steam cracker. So they have a multitude of projects currently that we have in a very early phase, but we are having very dedicated teams analyzing these projects, and we will then, of course, follow the usual CapEx stage gate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about dynamics in polypropylene? I think the Lyondell volumes were actually the highest in quite some time in this area. What kind of trends are you seeing on global supply and demand for both this year as well as into 2024? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Matthew. I'm going to give that question immediately to Ken. Ken Lane : Yes. Thank you very much, and thanks, Matthew, for the question. The dynamics that we're seeing in polypropylene around supply and demand is similar to what we're seeing in PE. There's still a tremendous amount of new capacity that has come online over the last 12 to 18 months, especially in China. China has now pretty much become balanced and even has been exporting some polypropylene. So that market is challenged, but we have seen the demand come back in polypropylene and have started to see some growth quarter-over-quarter. One of the market segments -- frankly, when I look across all of the market segments for our division, the automotive segment this year is showing signs of improvement when I compare it to others like packaging. We also have seen some improvement in Catalloy, some bounce back in volumes in Catalloy, driven by commercial construction. So, in general, it's we still have a very good portfolio of assets, but a very challenging market environment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mike Leithead : Great. Thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask a bigger picture question on O&P EAI profitability. EBITDA has been quite challenged for maybe the past five quarters or so. I know you highlighted the polypropylene closure. But is there any larger scale asset shutdowns or restructuring being considered here? And is it simply a question of demand recovering? Or I guess how do you think about a potential pathway to get this segment back to its, call it, $1 billion or so historic EBITDA level? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Mike. Very good question. And as you well noted, we are in the midst now of negotiating with the union representatives on the shutdown of that one particular line that we have in the southern part of Italy and Brindisi. Of course, as usual, we continue to look at all the other assets that we have, not just, I mean, limited to the O&P business, but also the I&D business as well as the APS business. I mean some actions you have seen that we have taken. Like, for example, I mean, our joint venture that we have in the [indiscernible] on PO/SM. We have idled that a couple of times already this year, just like we did at the end of last year. So that continues for us to be very important that we look at all these different opportunities. But we have taken, I mean, that decision that we are planning to shut down, I mean, that one line in the southern part of Italy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Thank you and good morning. And congrats on the nice results. If I look back three months ago, these 3 consensus was at $1.41 billion for the third quarter in EBITDA. And the company thought that, that was probably too high, and proactively went out with a guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. Obviously, you outlined the reasons why the results came in better, actually right in line with that $1.41 billion. But my question is, having taken that tact in the third quarter, as we stand here today, the Street is at $1.1 billion EBITDA for the fourth quarter, it begs the question in terms of no guidance that I would assume that Lyondell feels more positive about that results. Any color you could provide would be great. Peter Vanacker : Frank, thanks for your question. And absolutely, I mean, you're right. I mean about what we said on Q3, I mean we didn't call it guidance. But anyhow, the fact is, of course, I mean that during Q3, there were a couple of elements that happened in the markets. Like, for example, some of our peers had issues with their oxyfuels capacities. They had to take them offline. And due to the fact, of course, that we had our Holy Grail, I call it, of PO facilities in the world's successfully online, we were able, I mean, of course, to profit from that, not just I mean, with the volumes that we had available, but then also skyrocketing margins in that business. So our team -- there's a lot of details behind it, I mean, how our team was able to steer that between the different regions. And it shows the agility that we have in that business that we -- with those huge capacities that we have available in different parts in the world that we can maximize also the value. Remember, this is a core part of growing and upgrading the core, the first pillar that we have in our strategy. Now we've alluded also, if you talk about Q4, we've alluded to the fact that we have a normal seasonality in Q4. Kim also said with regards to Oxyfuels margins, they are higher, I mean, than what we have seen historically. We have the capacities, I mean, in place. But of course, one cannot always leverage or a situation whereby competition has issues, I mean, with their units. And therefore, we've said, I mean, margins in oxyfuels are going to be more, let's say, on an above historic level, but not on a peak level like it was in Q3. And then asset, I mean what is happening, I mean, at polyethylene and polypropylene and the olefins business. So I think we continue to be prudent when we are looking at Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, Just the Lombard ODA investment, is that purely a financial investment? Or do you have opportunity to interact with the companies and collaborate with the companies that are being invested in? And does that give you an edge on any potential new technologies or things like that? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you very much, I mean, Vincent, for that question. We've been, let's say, more strategic when we are looking at these kind of investments in funds. So of course, based upon our clearly articulated strategy at the Capital Markets Day, when we look at the second pillar of our strategy, building up a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business, it's clear that in that area, we are looking at enhancing also our knowledge on what is happening in the marketplace. So that fund ticks that box because we have more visibility on the market. In addition to that, of course, we also want to make sure that we are supporting these early-stage technologies, companies that were in that fund so that they can continue to grow. So it is not a pure just venture financial investments. It's much more also looking at it from a strategic and conceptual point of view. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, peter. A quick one. Recently in the news, there's been a lot of talk about lower water levels in the Mississippi. So I was just wondering whether that's impacting you guys in any way or form or broadly the industry as well. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Hassan, for your question. No impact, I mean, for our business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks, good morning everyone. Your cyclic announcement comes on the heels of many other acquisitions you've made in this area, and perhaps not one of them separately is very large. But I mean, it adds up to potentially quite a bit of capital. Could you provide any clarity on how much capital so far went into these acquisitions? And what would be the sort of the run rate going forward for how to spend on deals like this? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Aleksey thank you for your question. The second pillar of our strategy as I just mentioned, it's mainly focused at the beginning on building up these renewable and circular apps, one in Europe, and that is around Cologne, Wesseling Knapsack where we have our assets. And the other one is around Houston, so HRO channel view. The way how we have at the Capital Markets Day articulated our strategy is that we both go upstream in working together with partners, so also investing in the upstream to get access, I mean, to plastic waste because we do believe that getting access, I mean to plastic waste is important. Then secondly, investing in both micro recycling and then also advanced recycling, leveraging, of course, upon the relationship that we have with start-up companies, but also upon our own advanced catalytic recycling technology, the so-called MoReTec technology, with the two first investments FID, that I have mentioned before. And then thirdly, also, we are looking at or access that we have in the marketplace through our APS business. And here, we have done this Mepol acquisition so that we actually were closer to the brand owners closer to the OEMs, where the demand is actually coming from. So we have the entire value chain where we are taking positions and that's why you see all these smaller deals that we are making because there is no one company that is covering the entire value chain or that is covering, let's say, the upstream or the downstream in the value chain. We've said at the Capital Markets Day around 15% of our investments, maybe a little bit more than that 15% in the investments over the period of time that we were talking about, I mean, 2027, 2030. So pretty much, I mean, in that ballpark, has not changed our view substantially, but I said maybe a bit more than the 15% because we see that we have very good traction. Michael? Michael McMurray : Yes, and then to specifically put a breadbox maybe around these investments, just to give people a bit more perspective. While they're important to the strategy, they're not material in amount. And so kind of what we've invested thus far is less than $200 million. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Maybe two questions on your I&D segment, please. First, as I understand your comments on oxyfuels, it sounds like you expect profitability to regress based on butane and maybe some other factors. Have you seen that already in October? Or is that just an expectation for the future? Would be the first question? And then secondly, are your POSM plants still down? Or have they come back up? And maybe you can help us with the timing of those outages 4Q versus 3Q in terms of sequential modeling considerations. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Kevin, for your questions. I mean remember, I mean, oxyfuel margins what we said in Q3 were exceptional, but we continue because we are the lowest cost producer. We continue to be very comfortable, I mean, with higher margins than what we have seen historically. So I will lead it to Kim to answer in more detail your two questions. Kim Foley : Absolutely. So let's talk about the profitability of oxyfuels first. So some of the key drivers for the profitability there would be the price of crude, would be your gasoline cracks, would be your ratio of crude to butane, as well as the premium that the market will pay to put octane into the gasoline pool. So what you really saw blow out in the third quarter was that premium that people wanted to get that octane into their gasoline pool. So to answer your question as it relates to October, yes, we've seen that premium come down we see some volatility in crude, right? But -- that's why we're saying they're higher than historical, but not the peaks that we saw in the third quarter. And then to answer your question on POSM operating rates, the guidance that we've given earlier in the presentation was 70% operating rates for the fourth quarter. So we have two of our PO/TBA plants down, and we've got our POSM plants up to meet that 70% operating rate. Peter Vanacker : And as you can see, I mean, we have the investments on the PO/TBA plant is a very successful investment as we are running at 70% in total of our capacity. That gives us a huge opportunity also to continue to grow. And again, that fits them into the first pillar of our strategy, growing and upgrading the core because these are markets that are growing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed the question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to, I guess, get some more detail on your thoughts on how you're thinking about polyethylene markets from here. So as you noted, there were the two increases for August and September. But we're still seeing some challenging conditions in China, and then some new absorption of new capacity. So as you look into '24, do you think that we've bottomed out on PE markets and we should see some sustainable increases here? How would you characterize that with -- against the backdrop of U.S. demand and your operating review as well? Peter Vanacker : Before I lead, I mean, to Ken to answer that question, I mean, the comfortable -- I mean, the positive thing that we have seen is, of course, that continuously PE exports have gone up during the last quarter. So that is, of course, a positive sign. But one would need to, of course, also look at additional capacity that has come in the markets or that has not really hit the market because of some perceived, I mean, what we're reading the paper technical difficulties. Ken? Ken Lane : I'll just add to that, Arun, that we're seeing very good support for those exports with a high oil to gas ratio that we expect is going to continue, especially with the volatility around oil markets and gas production being relatively robust. So we do feel good about what's happening in the North American market. Europe is going to continue to be very challenged in terms of demand. That is still significantly down, mainly because of the inflation impacts but also the margins are challenged there with the higher naphtha pricing that we saw. So we've got good momentum coming out of the third quarter going into fourth quarter, seeing some signs of growth in China and really a very challenging market that's going to continue in Europe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Spector : Yes, thanks. Actually I want to follow up on the last point that when you're looking at China. I think -- can you give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of inventory? And are we over the hump on the capacity additions there? Or does that impact the shape of the curve as we go into next year? What's your view around that? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Josh, and going to take to Ken because that's related, I mean, then to PE your question. Ken Lane : Yes. So Josh, we're still going to see more capacity coming online next year, and that's why we're going to kind of be bouncing along the bottom. Overall, as an industry, I think, first half of next year and then the hope is in the back end of next year, we start to see some recovery in the market growth comes back to absorb the additional capacity, but there's going to be -- continue to be pressure around new capacity coming in, and that's going to be the biggest watch out for us. Peter Vanacker : Yes. You see, I mean, that from Beijing, there is continuously evaluations and incentives that are being put in place. We don't see the construction market now picking up yet. But if you then look, for example, in China, the motive has been 10% year-on-year increase and EV has actually has been closer in to 40%. But on the other hand side, I mean, we see the consumers continue to save, I mean, a lot of money. So savings continue to be at a high level. But more and more of these incentives, one would expect and, of course, also that the confidence will grow in the population in the middle class. And that, of course, would have then its influence on their spending on durable goods as well. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no other questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, again. Very good questions. And let me highlight again that we are very pleased, I mean, with the results, considering the market environment that we are in Q3. Great job that has been done by all the teams. We, of course, continue to look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to also make progress on the implementation of our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend and a safe one. Therefore, I wish you a great weekend. Stay well and stay safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results, while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today until March 2, by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13742056. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates & Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, including an update on LYBs strategic progress. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Let's begin as we always do, with our safety results on Slide 3. During 2023, our employees and contractors demonstrated their commitment to outstanding safety performance. LYBs total recordable injury rate was 0.14, which is approximately 20% lower than the average of the prior three years. I want to congratulate our APS segments where injuries were 38% lower than 2022, a significant improvement from historical levels. We always use safety performance as a leading indicator of operational excellence and business performance. But there is no greater value than seeing every member of our team return home to their families every day in the same health has when they began to work their working day. So turn to Slide four to discuss our financial results. 2023 was another challenging year for petrochemicals. While energy prices moderated in an environment of geopolitical unrest, markets were extremely cautious due to uncertainty about inflation and the potential for a more pronounced downturn in economic activity. Reported GDP growth in U.S. and China improved relative to 2022, the growth in petrochemicals was far below norms for our industry. Against that backdrop, LYB delivered earnings of $8.65 per share with an EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Cash generation was exceptional, and resulted in $4.9 billion of cash from operations. We have a highly efficient cash conversion ratio of 98%. We ended the year with $7.6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment grade balance sheet. And we exceeded our cost of capital with an 11% return on invested capital. In March of last year, we successfully launched our new strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York. Now let's turn to Slide five and briefly review the strategy. Our goal was to create focus, clarity, and alignments about direction LyondellBasell would be moving over the next five years and provide a clear vision of what the company would look like in 2027. Our strategy is built around three pillars, growing and upgrading the core, building a profitable circular and low carbon solutions business and stepping up performance and culture. In growing and upgrading the core, we are investing in businesses that fit with our competitive advantages and long-term strategy. Our circular and low carbon solutions business is driving leadership in circularity and addressing the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. In the third pillar, we are transforming the culture of LYB to embed a more comprehensive view of value creation, while continuing to recognize that stringent cost management is vital in our industry. On Slide six, we highlight our progress on our strategy in 2023 and the work underway over the next few years towards over 2027 goals. In just 10 months, since launching our strategy last March, LyondellBasell has unlocked nearly 1/3 of the $3 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA that we are targeting for 2027. The successful startup of the PO/TBA plant this year is a major step forward in growing and upgrading our core by adding approximately $450 million to our normalized EBITDA. And I'm very pleased to report that our value enhancement program is far exceeding our initial expectations. In 2023, the VEP achieved a year end run rate of more than $400 million of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA improvements, Michael will share more details on the progress of the VEP in a few moments. As shown on the slide, we have numerous workstreams underway to build towards our strategic goals of $2 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA by 2025, and a total of $3 billion by 2027. With the announced sale of the ethylene oxide and derivatives business to Ineos for $700 million, we are redirecting resources away from non-core businesses. The deal we announced in January to acquire 35% of NATPET in Saudi Arabia for approximately $500 million is just one example of how we are growing our core cost advantaged olefins, and polyolefins businesses. We're making great strides and building strong foundations for our circular and low carbon solutions business. In 2023, we took a final investment decision for our first tranche of advanced recycling capacity in Germany, using our proprietary catalytic MoReTec technology. And we are building partnerships to source waste plastic to supply our app in Germany, while also securing waste plastic in Houston to supply our next investment an advanced recycling capacity. And the VEP program is not a one-time initiative, Michael will describe our increased targets for 2024 and beyond. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I want to congratulate our team on the substantial progress we achieved on our strategic journey in 2023, ensuring a robust platform for longer term value creation and positive leverage to any market turnarounds. On Slide seven, let's take a look at the steps ahead to deliver on our goals. We will continue to grow and upgrade our core businesses by focusing on advantaged feedstocks in growing markets, where LYB can build or extend our leading market position. Our new joint venture in Saudi Arabia is one example of how we will do this. As we add new positions, we will continue to review our portfolio for businesses and assets that are not aligned with our long-term strategy. The divestiture of EO and derivatives business, the sale of our Australian polypropylene business. The shutdown of a polypropylene line in Italy and the exit of the refining business for all examples of how we are sharpening the focus of our business portfolio. The rapid progress of the LYB value enhancement program also contributes to our growth through low-cost capacity debottlenecks and productivity improvements. We're making good progress on building the foundations for our circular and low carbon solutions business as we work towards our goal of $500 million of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030. And our VEP is not only delivering growth and productivity, the VEP also supports the third pillar of our strategy to step up performance and culture by instilling a value-based mindset across the company. With numerous initiatives to improve margins through customer and commercial excellence embedded in the VEP. And our work is to transform our advance polymer solutions business is also an important part of our work to step up performance and culture. All of our progress is supported by our foundations of efficient cash generation, disciplined capital allocation, and our investment grade balance sheet. We're leveraging partnerships where it fits to achieve growth with capital efficiency. And we're pursuing a very value focused investment program. And we remain steadfast in our support for a secure, competitive and growing dividends as part of our commitment to competitive shareholder returns. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael to discuss the details of our financial progress. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide eight and let's take a look at the progress of our value enhancement program. As Peter mentioned, LYBs value enhancement program far exceeded our initial expectations in 2023. When we launched the program, we thought we could achieve a 2023 year-end run rate of $150 million of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA improvement. With high engagement and rapid execution, our team achieved a run rate of more than $400 million by year-end 2023. We have a strong management system in place for our VEP program. Our team has screened more than 13,000 ideas, and more than 1900 of these ideas have advanced to the execution ready stage of our process. By the end of 2023, we executed on approximately 450 of these initiatives. Our system is robust and disciplined, and our internal and external auditors have validated our processes. We currently believe this effort will add a total of $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 and up to a billion dollars by the end of 2025. This is a significant increase from our initial target of $750 million that we announced last March, driven by the enthusiastic [indiscernible] of our colleagues and the tangible results that we have delivered so far. The LYV value enhancement program is providing meaningful contributions to our strategic financial goals. And we'll continue to do so as we move forward. On Slide nine, let me share more details about the progress on our VEP program during 2023. Our targets for the program are described as year-end run rates relative to 2021 volumes, and using average margins from 2017 to 2019, a time period that provides a good approximation of mid cycle margins. Through more than 450 initiatives, we generated over $300 million of VEP EBITDA from the program based on 2023 margins. This reflects the net recurring improvements throughout the year relative to 2021 volume, product mix and cost. Now, let me highlight a few of the initiatives from last year. At our Lake Charles integrated polyethylene joint venture, we automated controls for a water treatment unit that reduced manual operations and water consumption. With a small investment, we were able to reduce our LYB share of cost by $800,000 annually. In our oxy fuels business, our cost advantaged U.S. production is exported in vessels to markets around the world. We worked with one of our terminal providers to encourage their investment in a vapor recovery system that allowed LYB to double decile loading rates to reduce demerge cost and vapor emissions for a net recurring benefit of $1 million per year. By investing resources to learn more about the needs of our customers, our polymer product development team allocated resources for new products to serve demanding applications and wired cable sheathing for subsea infrastructure markets. This initiative improved recording profitability by at least $300,000 per year. We hope these examples provides you some insight into the hundreds of small initiatives that we have that we expect to add up to $1 billion of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA to LYBs run rate by the end of 2025. Please turn to Slide 10. And let me begin by highlighting the outstanding Cash Generation from our business portfolio during 2023. LYB generated a total of $4.9 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Cash on hand increased to $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2023, we achieved cash conversion of 98% well above our long-term target of 80%. Our cash conversion was bolstered by working capital reduction of approximately $700 million during the fourth quarter. The majority of the working capital benefit was from lower receivables and inventories. We expect our working capital needs will increase during the first quarter. Our efficient cash generation allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2023. This represents 53% of our $3.4 billion of free cash flow for the year. Let's continue with Slide 11 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. As Peter mentioned, we are committed to discipline capital allocation as we execute our strategy and maintain our robust investment grade balance sheet. During 2023 cash from operating activities fully funded $1.6 billion in dividends $210 million in share repurchases and our capital investment program. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, marking the 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. This year, we invested 1.5 billion in capital expenditures. We reached an important milestone with the successful startup of our new PO/TBA asset in 2023. With the completion of this world scale project, our future capital expenditures will be increasingly focused on a portfolio of smaller projects to advance our strategy. This includes investments in small profit generating projects, integrated hubs for circular solutions, and hundreds of initiatives within the value enhancement program. We ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, then $7.6 billion of cash and available liquidity. In line with our strategic focus on leadership and sustainability. We issued our initial inaugural green bond for $500 million LYBs robust balance sheet positions as well to move forward on our long term strategy during the year ahead. One last comment. We added over a billion dollars of cash to our balance sheet in 2023 as a result of strong execution amid challenging market conditions. As a result, we are carrying about two times our stated minimum of 1.5 billion. We have built a bit more cash because of the challenging market conditions and uncertain economic outlook that we have been navigating. That said our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. And we remain committed to returning 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over the long-term. Now I would like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Page 12. LYBs business portfolio delivered $910 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our lower results reflect a significant decline in gasoline crack spreads in seasonally lower demand during the fourth quarter. Lower gasoline cracks bedspreads negatively impacted our refining results oxy fuels in the intermediates and Driftwood segment and the value of coproduct fuels and olefins and polyolefins Americas. During the quarter, lower ethane in energy cost and increased polyethylene exports benefitted our O&P Americas business. Overall, olefins and polyolefins demand remained soft, particularly in Europe, where utilization rates remained low. Lower demand and higher raw material costs negatively impacted our advanced polymer solution segment. Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge decreased pre tax for quarter results by approximately $55 million. As a reminder, the LIFO impact reflects changes in inventory valuation over the full year and it's not necessarily limited to fourth quarter valuations. Before we discuss our segment results in detail, let me discuss our capital expenditure plans for 2024, our capital plan includes approximately $800 billion for profit generating growth projects, and $1.3 billion of sustaining investment to keep our assets running safely and reliably. The increased profit generating capital includes investments to grow our circular and low carbon solutions business, as well as investments to lower the carbon footprint of our existing asset base, particularly in Europe. Funding required to drive our value enhancement program is included in our CapEx plan. We expect our 2024 effective tax rate will be approximately 20%. And our cash tax rate will be a few percentage points higher. In the appendix of the slide deck, we have provided additional 2024 modeling information, including impacts for major plant maintenance costs associated with the exit from our refining business than other useful financial metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Ken Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Americas segments. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $604 million. During the quarter a significant decrease in co-product values negatively impacted olefin's margins. Polyolefins prices were stable domestically, while a very strong export volume led to some lower pricing in our overall portfolio. Strong demand from export markets continues to drive increased polyethylene volumes, and we didn't see the typical seasonal slowdown. We operated our assets at approximately 85% of nameplate capacity to match market demand and continued to actively manage working capital. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $75 million. During the first quarter, we expect polyethylene prices to remain firm with modest improvements in domestic demand and ongoing strength in export markets. We anticipate ethane and energy costs will remain favorable for our assets in the region, providing some margin tailwinds. Overall, we expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter, slightly lower than fourth quarter 2023 due to plant maintenance. In December, we signed two new renewable power purchase agreements. With these agreements, we've achieved almost 90% of our goal to procure at least 50% of our global power from renewable sources by 2030. In total, we have 12 agreements in place, representing more than 1.3 gigawatts of renewable power capacity. As we mentioned, last quarter, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture with Agilyx and ExxonMobi. This partnership is focused on increasing plastic waste, recycling infrastructure to improve circularity. In December Cyclyx announced the final investment decision to build the first Cyclyx circularity center in Houston. The circularity center will focus on increasing plastic waste recycling options, through better sourcing and sorting of plastic waste. The facility will have the capacity to produce more than 130,000 tons of plastic feedstock per year for advanced and mechanical recycling and is expected to start off in 2025. Now, please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins. Europe, Asia and international segment. During the quarter, European markets remained weak with softer seasonal demand and lower consumer confidence. Polymer prices were modestly higher with an improved sales mix and stable naphtha feedstock costs. Due to the low demand, we operated our assets at rates of approximately 65% during the quarter. The combined impact of the weak demand and low rates lead to a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $87 million. As we move into 2024, we expect weak European demand will persist with ongoing consumer uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are seeing modest improvements in orders as some customers begin to restock and seek local supply as imports moving through the Red Sea are disrupted. We expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 75% during the first quarter. Demand in China remains muted as customers manage inventories with the approach of the lunar new year amid a slow economic environment. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our recent announcement to acquire a 35% share of naphtha reflects our focus on assets that have long-term advantage. But we're also moving away from the assets that can't deliver long-term competitiveness, as demonstrated by last year's decision to close one of our two polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We're also making good progress with building our circular and low carbon business. During the fourth quarter, we made the final investment decision to build our first commercial catalytic advanced recycling plant at our Wesseling Germany site. With an estimated capacity of 50,000 tons per year this plant will utilize our differential MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And just like in Houston, we are collaborating with partners to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany. In December, we acquired a minority share of Source One plastics, a plastic waste sourcing company in Germany. Source One will provide the majority of the processed plastic waste feedstock to our new MoReTec assets. Through our integrated hub model, we are establishing an integrated circular value chain at scale. Now please turn to Slide 15. And let's take a closer look at our new NATPET joint venture. A few weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire a 35% share of national petrochemical industrial company or where NATPET from Alujain Corporation and Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The joint venture is a great example of how we are growing our core businesses with advantage of the assets by leveraging LYBs leading technology and global market reach. Today, NATPET consists of 400,000 tons of propane dehydrogenation or PDH capacity that converts cost advantage Saudi propane into propylene monomer to feed a 400,000 ton polypropylene unit utilizing LYBs proprietary Spheripol technology. The assets have been operational since 2009 and have generated an annual average of U.S.$155 million in EBITDA over the five years from 2018 to 2022. NATPETs PP products serve a diverse range of customers across global markets. As part of the transaction, LYB will leverage our global marketing network to sell a majority of the product on behalf of net pet creating a new revenue stream for LYB. NATPETs assets are first quartile that have the advantage of sourcing local Saudi propane feedstock at a discount to global prices. Also our investment in NATPET provides a platform for continued growth. In 2022, NATPET was awarded a new feedstock allocation that could support additional capacity. The partners are evaluating a second PDH PP asset on the site that would benefit from meaningful synergies. Previously, Alujain selected LYB sphere zone polypropylene technology for the potential expansion. The high-performance polypropylene solutions enabled by our proprietary sphere zone technology provides the potential to expand NATPETs production into new applications and markets. We expect our investment in NATPET will exceed our 12% target for unlevered internal rates of return. The additional capacity could provide even higher returns. We expect the transaction will close in the first half of 2024 following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim. Kim Foley : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16, as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $265 million. Oxyfuel margins declined due to a significant decrease in gasoline CAC spreads as well as an increased supply of oxyfuels after industry downtime during the third quarter. Direct margins were pressured due to higher benzene feedstock costs, LIFO inventory charges were approximately $95 million. In the fourth quarter we recognized an impairment of $192 million related to our PO/SM joint venture in the Netherlands. We operated our assets at a rate of approximately 70% during the fourth quarter due to low demand as well as planned and unplanned downtime across most businesses. As we begin the first quarter oxyfuel margins remain similar to fourth quarter levels. We anticipate higher volumes across the segment after downtime in the fourth quarter and plan to operate across the IMD segment at approximately 75% in the first quarter. These operating rates reflect the impact of the recent winter freeze event, resulting in unplanned downtime at our U.S. Gulf Coast assets. In December, we announced an agreement to divest our ethylene oxide and derivative business to Ineos for $700 million. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are taking decisive actions to grow and upgrade that businesses and assets that align with our long-term strategy. While exiting businesses where LYB does not have a path to a leading position. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter following regulatory approvals, and other closing conditions. Please note that the agreed transaction price is pre-tax, and that these assets are heavily depreciated. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $51 million, including charges of $40 million of LIFO inventory valuation refining margins compressed due to lower gasoline crack spreads. During the quarter we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity due to planned and unplanned downtime, with an average crude rate of 230,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect gasoline crack spreads will improve offset by lower distillate cracks. We plan to operate the refinery directionally 80% of capacity in the first quarter, including a planned Coker outage with an estimated EBITDA impact of $50 million. Our team remains highly focused on safe and reliable operations as we continue to run our refining assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment on slide 18. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $12 million. Margins were pressured by higher raw material cost and volumes decreased due to seasonally lower fourth quarter demand with a slowdown in December due to customer outages. Likely inventory valuations benefits were $10 million. Looking ahead, we see signs of market recovery and expect modest demand improvement in the first quarter. This year, we continued our transformation journey with advanced polymer solutions. APS results in 2023 were lower than 2022 and not reflected of our financial expectations for this business. Success with APS customers is largely based on project-by-project qualification. Today's underperformance is indicative of our low success rate in gaining new qualifications during prior quarters. However, our laser focus on our customers is gaining momentum. We have seen a step up in our recent surveys for customer satisfaction. With an organization that is focused and accountable. We're making steady progress as we rebuild our project growth funnel. Our growth pipeline is already delivering. During the fourth quarter of 2023, volumes improved by 2.5% over the prior year. I want to congratulate the APS team for achieving record safety performance in 2023. I truly believe our customer focus, as measured by our recent customer satisfaction survey, our progress in refilling our growth funnel and our superior safety results reflects our attention to detail that provides a leading indicator for operational performance and eventual financial results. With that, I will return the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thanks, Torkel. I would like to thank the entire LyondellBasell team for delivering such resilient results during a very challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, licensing revenue moderated after exceptionally strong results in the third quarter due to the timing of licensing milestones. Nonetheless, EBITDA for the segment exceeded the fourth quarter of the prior year. Fourth quarter catalyst volumes were higher than any quarter since the third quarter of 2022. First quarter results for the technology segments were expected to improve due to increased licensing revenue and a further rise in catalyst volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. As Ken mentioned earlier, we will utilize our proprietary MoReTec technology as we build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. I'm very proud of the work our R&D team embarked on years ago to develop this differential and advantage technology from lab to commercial scale. Let me now summarize our outlook with Slide 20. As we begin 2024, the majority of our businesses are continuing to face the slow demand seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. But we are seeing a few early signs of improvement. Our North American O&P business is seeing modest demand improvements. In Europe, order trends were improving from a very low level as our O&P customers begin to pursue modest restocking. For the year, we expect normal seasonal demand improvements to begin near the end of the first quarter and continue through the summer. As we progress through the second half of the year, we expect demand to benefit from moderating interest rates and reduced inflation. Durable goods are a critical market for LYBs products. Demand for durable goods lacked the economy during 2022 and 2023. As markets digested the extraordinary high levels of consumer activity that prevailed during pandemic era stimulus. We expect that moderating interest rates, reduced inflation and infrastructure-related stimulus spending will begin to support a gradual return to a healthier demand for durable goods during the second half of this year. China is the largest market for chemicals, exceeding North America and Europe combined, and we continue to watch closely for targeted stimulus and other measures that could drive improved economic growth in China. In the meantime, LYB will continue to advance on our strategic goals. We are actively managing our portfolio to grow and upgrade our core businesses. We will continue to see actions supporting the growth of regional hubs that will serve as the engines for our profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And our work to embed value creation into our corporate culture will continue to deliver results through our value enhancement program. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Richardson : Peter, I was wondering if you could just dig in a little bit on the expectations for the second half and maybe just a little bit more on the O&P businesses. What kind of recovery are you kind of underwriting in your outlook? And how do you think that plays out and any guideposts beyond the statements on durables we should be thinking about as the year progresses? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Stephen. As usual, very good question from your side. To start with, as we alluded to, I mean, we're still a bit prudent on the guidance for Q1. But when we are looking at the second half of this year, a couple of things that I want to point to. This has been the longest downturn that we have seen as far as I can look back in our history. So one would expect I mean that there will be, if you look at inflation rates going down, interest rates going down, more consumer confidence in Europe maybe also in China, that demand would go up. So from a demand side, one would expect that demand would go up. And that covers not only the O&P business, but also if you look at durable groups, especially. As we all know, demand has been very low last year in durable goods, which, of course, has a lot to do with very high interest rates and therefore, consumer behavior so also, you would expect that durable goods demand would go up, I mean, especially in the second half of this year. The United States, as you know, has been quite robust. We have been able to navigate. You see robust margins also on the polyethylene side. And also here, as you know, inflation rates are going down. You see already a little bit of indications. There is more house builds, houses [indiscernible] that are being sold. And that, of course, has a direct impact on demand for durable goods. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Sorry about that. Pardon me, I was on mute sorry about that. Just regarding the napped joint venture, it seems like it's roughly 10x EBITDA, is that roughly right? And do you see potential for this investment to generate a higher EBITDA down the road? And I just wondering the basis for that investment, given it seems like polypropylene bit oversupplied. And I guess my other question on it would be what are the contract terms for the propane that you get from Saudi, any risk that price could get escalated down the road. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Steve. Also a good question on NATPET. First of all, I mean, we are very pleased that we were able to sign this deal that has been work of a core team in our company where I was personally, of course, deeply involved during quite an important period of time to come to this conclusion. When you look at the amount of money that we paid and Ken alluded to that in his remarks, then one cannot just look at the EBITDA, mid-cycle EBITDA to $150 million for the entire company. But what you don't see and what needs to take into consideration is the fact that we are the path to market, so we are generating value for the company that comes out of selling the products outside of Saudi Arabia to our other markets. And therefore, also strategically very important because we have a very sustainable low-cost feedstock basis that we have negotiated that is included in the deal so that we are better positioned in Polypropylene to go to certain markets where maybe today, we don't have the best position. And here, let's not forget that we did close '19 at our Brindisi assets in Italy as well. In addition to that, as we alluded to, we have the income streams generated out of our license agreements. We have the opportunity to continue to invest with the second line next to the existing lines to capture synergies there. And that's why Ken alluded to the fact that with the current deal, we are in iron ore, which is above 12%. But then as we do the second step, then we would be higher to say, I mean, quite higher than 12% or no final investment decision yet, but it is also part of the consideration in doing that first. Michael McMurray : Steve, in the multiple is probably closer to 9 versus 10 just for clarity. Peter Vanacker : Without taking into consideration, I mean, marketing fees, et cetera, et cetera. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Cunningham : Maybe within the $800 million in growth CapEx allocated for this year, how much of that is directly related to circular and low-carbon solutions? And beyond that, what should we expect in terms of inorganic growth and additional investments in that space for 2024? Peter Vanacker : I will just refer to the Capital Markets Day, we said about 15% over the cycle. Michael, do you want to add something to that, for next year? Michael McMurray : Yes. I mean what I'd say is that the guidance that we gave at Capital Markets Day for CapEx remains intact. As a reminder, we said over the period, '23 to '25 on average, we'd spend $2 billion. We guided to $2.1 billion today. And as Peter said, the expectation for the CLC SR circularity business it's about 15% to 20% over the period. Now specifically around inorganic growth. I'd probably say a couple of things. I think at our Capital Markets Day, we were clear that we hope to get some M&A done over the next few years. I think we were pretty clear the criteria that we shared in regards to growing and upgrading the core. I think the Sasol joint venture, our new PO/TBA facility, the circularity investments that we've made and the refining exit are all great examples and then our recent announcement of our EO and D exit is another great example. And quite frankly, it was a great valuation with the best owner mindset. We also shared our approach to growth through M&As and joint ventures at our Capital Markets Day. And I think with our Damped acquisition, we're off to a great start, and this clearly fits the framework, which we shared back in March. And then, it also has a great opportunity for future attractive growth. And then finally, at our March Capital Markets Day, we shared our goal of getting to $10 billion of EBITDA normalized EBITDA in 2027, which assumed we would deploy roughly the remaining 30% of our free cash flow that we haven't returned to investors to fund our future M&A ambitions. But I want to be clear about a couple of things. Our commitments to investors remain steadfast and our capital allocation principles and priorities remain unchanged. We will be disciplined acquirers we will not burn it in your cash. We will not build a lazy balance sheet. If we can't find compelling transactions, we'll give back more of your cash to you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Just in IND, how much of the PO/TBA plant contributed in 2023? Do you think mid-cycle earnings power here is still with the new CBA plant above $2 billion. And when do you think you'll start achieving a run rating at that mid-cycle earnings level? Thank you. Peter Vanacker : Happy birthday, Dave. We heard that you have your birthday today. Good question. If I take 1 step back on the I&D business in Q4, maybe a couple of numbers and stay with me so $265 million, excluding identified items is the EBITDA that we generated in Q4. But one needs to take into consideration, of course, that we had a heavy LIFO impact of $95 million. So if I add the LIFO impact of $95 million, then exit the underlying results were $360 million for Q4 comparing to Q4 2022 which was $291 million. So a quite underlying performance, good quarter in IND and I did not even take into consideration the fact that we had scheduled turnarounds bottleneck as well as in Bayport. So we alluded to that, in our guidance at the time when we released the Q3 results of an impact of about $120 million. So we laying quite a good quarter in IND. And of course, part of that was also due to the fact that we very successfully started up our PO/TBA plant. The new PO/TBA plant, we alluded to mid-cycle margins, $450 million. We said last year in year one. So that means 2023. We would run at a minimum of 50% nameplate capacity. We overachieved that target. We ran at approximately a little bit more than 60%, I would say. And then, also when we look at this year, we will continue to ramp up, and we will do it in a very disciplined way, reflecting on market demand for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. But one may see further progress, I would say, probably going to 70%, maybe exceeding 70% capacity utilization. And then when we move into 2025, that's where one would see the full benefit of the PO/TBA plant in terms of capacity utilization. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Just on the value enhancement program. I'm just trying to understand the impact to '23 and '24, a bit better. If we just sort of kind of look at a ratio of sort of what that 2017 to 2019 EBITDA was at Lyondell then versus what it was in 2023. If we apply that ratio to the VEP numbers, would that be about right in terms of what you enjoyed from it in '23 and what you expect in '24? Michael McMurray : Yes. What I'd say, I mean, hopefully, you heard my prepared remarks, Vincent, so the benefit, the actual benefit in our P&L for 2023 was approximately $300 million. And then we guided for '24 for an exit run rate of $600 million. Now if you're trying to draw a line from '23 to '25, it looks like that kind of the pace of change slows a bit. But keep in mind that last year, we focused on low-hanging fruit, things that didn't require investment and that we could execute upon very quickly. So we're in kind of building up projects again as we sit in this year, but we have high confidence in the outlook that we gave up to $1 billion in 2025 and again, $300 million of P&L benefit in '23, actual. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Michael Sison : Cheers, in terms of 2024 a lot of chemical companies you've reported thus far has sort of said their earnings could recover or be better in '24 versus '23. It sounds like your first half is going to be a little bit challenged with demand being weaker and the second half being a little bit better. So when you sort of total up potentially what you see in '24, should earnings be up, flat or down or just maybe directionally for the full year, how do you think about the setup for early? Peter Vanacker : Well, Michael, you said it yourself. I mean, Q1, still modest Q2 seasonal demands have been picking up. And then what I said at the beginning also second half of the year, we expect at least, that we will see interest rates going down demand for durable goods, I mean going up, some recovery in Europe, some recovery in China. So as a consequence, if you added all that, one would expect that earnings are going to be better than last year. Michael McMurray : But mostly in the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. I'm sorry. We'll go on to our next question, comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : In 2024, would you expect your regional mix of earnings to differ materially from 2023. Part of the reason I ask is it looks like you're guiding to a tax rate of 20% and often regional mix is the reason behind that, but perhaps there are other reasons you might call out. Maybe you could just kind of talk through the dynamics there would be helpful. Michael McMurray : Yes. I'm happy to talk through it. So yes, I mean, the ETR, we guided to of 20% is up roughly 1 percentage point versus what was in 2023. So not a huge story. There's a few give and takes. Now we did guide our cash tax rate to be up a couple of percentage points versus last year and also our ETR from 2023 and that's largely driven by a decrease in U.S. tax depreciation and also the gain on the sale of our EO&D business. Hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Could we get an update on your China operations both in PO styrene and your polyolefins JVs? Peter Vanacker : Yes, John. Welcome back. Let me give that question to Ken. The opportunity? Ken Lane : Yes, sure. I'll take a question for O&P and then maybe Kim, you can comment on IND. But for O&P, we continue to operate the joint venture at technical minimums. The focus really is on finding better product mix and customer mix in region. Our focus when we entered that joint venture was to build out an increased presence in the domestic market because we do market the high-density polyethylene and polypropylene from the asset. The team did a great job with that last year. So earnings, of course, are still very challenged in China. If you look at average margins, they're still slightly negative which we're seeing that in our asset. Even with a new world-scale asset, it still is a very challenging market, and we expect to start to see some improvement in that in the second half of the year. But so far, demand has been, I'd say, modestly improving, but haven't seen really an improvement in margins yet, Kim? Kim Foley : I would say as it relates to the joint ventures we have on the propylene oxide guide. We ran both of those JVs above 95% operating rates last year, excluding a turnaround, which was significantly higher than other PO plants in that region. As Ken alluded to, the margins were rather thin. We saw high raw material costs, and we also saw high utilities. But as we've mentioned before, these are the best technologies that we have in the region. They are very cost competitive. They sit on integrated sites owned by a very good operator with expertise in both of these technologies. And we think as we go forward, we have huge potential here. Peter Vanacker : And may I add to that also, you probably noticed some news flow around China, phasing out chlorine-based propylene oxide technologies towards 2025. The majority of propylene oxide capacity in China that would be phased out for time which also fits for us very well together with our global strategy, the successful start-up of our PO/TBA plant. And we are running this business successfully under Kevin's leadership from a global basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mike Leithead : I wanted to add around O&P EAI, EBITDA has been below breakeven, I think 4 out of the last 6 quarters. And I appreciate demand isn't great across most markets. But it just seems like there's been a bit of a shift here versus the profitability in the past decade. So do we need to take a bigger restructuring overhaul to make this business profitable again? Do we need to wait for the world to get better? I mean just how are you approaching that business here in '24? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, Mike. A very good question. And you've seen from our actions already last year that we are turning around every stone. We did shut down one line in Brindisi, which is an important capacity. We've seen that there has been a couple of other announcements in the marketplace in terms of consolidations. We continue to look, of course, at the entire portfolio. That's what you would expect us to do. But having said that, I also reflect back on Q4. So in a big picture on for the company for us, was towards the end of the year, we wanted to also optimize our cash flow and working capital. And we freed up about $700 million in working capital in that Q4. And as a consequence, of course, also can see this business towards lower than what we had originally guided to. 75% of capacity utilization was the guidance. We reduced at really surprisingly low levels 65% of our capacity utilization. Again, in the context of also with the current market environment, optimizing our working capital. Anything you want to add? Ken Lane : No, that's it. I mean that just impacted the P&L with the absorption of the fixed costs that go along with that. But we pulled hard on the working capital lever, and we're going to continue to stay focused on maximizing cash flow. Challenging environment. Peter Vanacker : Yes. And we see the future also in Europe. You see also that regulation is progressing in terms of renewable and circular solutions which is actually also what we are focusing upon, I mean, with quite a lot of activities in terms of building [indiscernible], the final investment decision for our MoReTec-1 facility, but lots of joint ventures and feedstock cooperations that we have built up in the meantime. So that in Europe, I continue to believe that these circular and renewable solutions, they demand, local supply chains. So therefore, it will be very important to have such a leading position in a local market with the access to brand owners or EPS business, access to OEMs as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Just a follow-up on the NATPET joint venture. I guess, can you help us to understand in terms of the ability to upscale that with the additional allocation, is it similar in scale or size, would it be kind of the 400 KTA? And also, when you think about the timing of financial investment decision and also how the capital gets allocated? Is it going to be proportional is the same kind of 35%, 65% or is there some different variation to that? Can you help us to think about those? Peter Vanacker : Yes, the current capacity, as you rightfully said, is around, 400KT so with the other that Ken referred to. We would be able to scale up to in total capacity of 1 million tons. Again, we have 35% of the joint venture. So that 35% is valid for the current capacity, but we can also be valid for future capacity if we take a final investment decision. Ken some more information that you want to share? Ken Lane : Yes, I'll just add that part of the synergy that you had talked about before is that region is short of propylene. And so we're going to have additional propylene capacity with this expansion, which is one of the synergies around potentially executing that. But it will be financed by the joint venture. And yes, it will be proportionate for the shareholders, but we don't expect to be putting cash in. That's going to be something financed by the joint venture. Operator : Our final question this morning comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Looking at the 70% payout target versus free cash flow just in the context of increasing CapEx when you're considering these payout targets, why is the denominator free cash and not more of like a cash from operations. Don't you need to balance these returns on the growth investments against returning cash to investors. Michael McMurray : Not sure I fully understand your question, but it's pretty typical when you're giving payout targets to give it on the free cash flow line versus operating cash flow. Peter Vanacker : And then we also, at the Capital Markets Day guided to words, that what is the CapEx level that we are investing so sustainable CapEx around. I mean that $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion a year. And then the growth CapEx, we also said we're going to be pretty much in the range of our historic spending somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion on a yearly basis depending on how these projects come. So I think that helps you, to do the back of the unloved calculation, whatever cash flow number you take. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for final comments. Peter Vanacker : Okay. Thank you, again, for all the excellent questions. And of course, I also want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding value and maximizing cash conversion during these challenging times. We look forward to sharing more updates over the coming months with further progress on our long-term strategy. We wish you all a great weekend and stay well, stay safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Good day, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.  Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern time today until May 26 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13743073. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael  McMurray; Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins and Refining; Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. During today's call, our leaders will be discussing results in line with the organizational changes we announced on February 19. In addition to her prior responsibilities for Refining & Supply Chain, Kim Foley is now our Executive Vice President for Global Olefins and Polyolefins. Kim will discuss the results for both O&P segments as well as the refining segments. Joining us for the first time on our earnings telephone conference in his new role as Executive Vice President, is Aaron Ledet, who is taking over responsibility from Kim in leading our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Over more than 20 years in the petrochemical industry, with 12 of those years at LYB, Aaron has served in a variety of roles in both Europe and the United States. Most recently, Aaron was responsible for the manufacturing and commercial operations for our O&P Americas segment, where he was also responsible for developing future options for our Houston refinery. Please join me in welcoming Aaron to this call. Before we dive into the results, I hope you will invest some time to review this year's addition of our Sustainability Report that we released a few weeks ago. Over the past year, we embedded sustainability into our strategy and made significant progress on our ambitions. This year's Sustainability Report describes how LYB is making everyday sustainability a reality. Let's turn to Slide 3 and begin the discussion with our continued leadership in safety performance. There is no greater accomplishment than having every member of our team return home to their families every day in the same health as when they began their working day. This is a cornerstone of our successful and sustainable business. LyondellBasell's first quarter incident rate for employees and contractors improved to a rate of only 1 injury per 2 million hours worked. We believe our safety metrics continue to hold a leading position in our industry. And I want to congratulate our team for their outstanding safety performance. Moving to Slide 4. As we discuss our company's performance during today's teleconference, we hope you will take away 2 main messages. First, LyondellBasell continues to generate resilient results while managing challenging market conditions, which have pressured our industry over the past 2 years. In the first quarter, LYB increased its EBITDA modestly over the fourth quarter. Our cash generation was negatively impacted by a build in working capital for good reasons, higher prices and higher volumes. And we see other encouraging signs that the industry is beginning to recover. The ratio of oil to gas prices strongly favors LYB's advantage production in North America and the Middle East. Our olefins and polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment has returned to profitability. And we're seeing early indications of improvements in the performance of our APS segment. The second key message is that LyondellBasell's focused strategy is creating unique opportunities to transform our business. As you have heard me say many times, we are executing on 3 strategic pillars : we're growing and upgrading our core businesses through the startup of our new PO/TBA capacity and the acquisition of our NATPET joint venture in the Middle East. We intend to give a more substantive update on this pillar of our strategy during our second quarter results. Now we're stepping up our performance and culture to embrace value creation through our Value Enhancement Program and the transformation of our APS segment. As you might recall, we gave a detailed update on our VEP during last quarter's results. But the most impactful transformation is the progress we have made on our strategic pillar to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. The so-called CLCS business will move our feedstocks away from fossil fuels towards an increasing share of recycled and renewable sources. We're building this business through a disciplined, capital-efficient strategy that leverages our existing infrastructure and our competitive advantages, such as leading positions in growing markets and a global network of deep customer relationships. In addition to the first quarter improvements in our underlying businesses, I hope you will come away from this call with an improved understanding of our progress in building CLCS and share our excitement for the future of LyondellBasell. Moving to Slide 5. Let's focus on the actions we are taking to build a profitable CLCS business. LYB is targeting capabilities across the circular and low-carbon solutions value chain. We are making a series of strategic investments in plastic waste sourcing, advanced sorting, mechanical recycling and advanced recycling. Slide 5 illustrates how all of these investments fit together to form a comprehensive approach to value creation for LyondellBasell's CLCS business. LyondellBasell's investments in waste sourcing and advanced sorting enable our company to maximize value from a wide variety of recycled and renewable waste streams. Our network will allow LYB to select the highest value proposition for a particular waste feedstock, whether that involves mechanical recycling, advanced recycling or renewables. We continue to use JV structures where appropriate to improve capital efficiency and builds in supply chain resiliency, while growing scale and gaining access to market-leading technologies. Construction is underway in Germany at our Cologne integrated hub for our first advanced recycling asset using LYB's proprietary catalyst technology, MoReTec, with a final investment decision expected next year for a second unit in Houston that will likely be twice the size of the German facility. We are evaluating options for the potential reuse of the hydro treaters at our Houston refinery to purify recycled and renewable cracker feedstocks. All of these capabilities enable LYB to leverage to substantial investments in our existing cracker and polymerization capacities to process recycled and renewable feedstocks. Finally, in collaboration with converters and brand owners, we bring the recycled and renewable content of these polymers to market through both direct channels and through the custom compounding solutions offered by our APS business. Using mass balancing, the majority of our sales volumes were sold under our well-known Circulen brands. Turning to Slide 6. You can see how the focused execution of our CLCS strategy is resulting in rapid and meaningful growth in sales volumes for LYB's recycled and renewable-based polymers. In 2023, our volumes grew to 123,000 tons, doubling our 2022 sales. And we expect this excellent momentum will continue as we drive towards our 2030 target of at least 2 million tons per year. Last year, at our Capital Markets Day, we outlined our financial targets for LyondellBasell's CLCS business. We continue to expect an incremental EBITDA contribution of $500 million by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030 from this business. By expanding our regional hubs with disciplined acquisitions and organic growth, we are confident we can continue to build and strengthen the leadership position to serve this undersupplied market while generating attractive margins to achieve our financial targets. Let's turn to Slide 7 and summarize our financial results. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results from our well-positioned and diverse portfolio. Earnings were $1.53 per share. EBITDA was $1.1 billion. During the quarter, cash from operating activities consumed about $100 million, and our balance sheet remains robust with $6.5 billion of available liquidity. Let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of the business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by addressing our cash generation. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.3 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team efficiently converted 93% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $2.3 billion. LYB's investment-grade balance sheet remains strong and enables us to continue to execute on our strategy and grow profitably while increasing returns for our shareholders. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital deployment. During the first quarter, our businesses consumed about $100 million in cash from operating activities. EBITDA improvement was more than offset by a working capital build of just over $600 million. As Peter mentioned, our working capital build was for good reasons, including higher prices and higher volumes, primarily within our O&P-EAI and I&D segments. In O&P-EAI, receivables increased with higher sales volumes as we benefited from the Red Sea logistic disruptions. Our I&D segment had higher receivables due to styrene price increases, and we rebuilt some oxyfuel inventories after fourth quarter maintenance. Our resilient cash generation has resulted in $1.8 billion returned to shareholders over the last 12 months through both dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we successfully issued $750 million worth of bonds to refinance our 2024 maturity, which reduced our coupon rate by 25 basis points. Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have $11 billion in long-term debt with an average maturity of about 18 years and a 4% average cost of debt. I would now like to provide a brief overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.1 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Profitability improved quarter-over-quarter in 5 of our 6 segments. In our O&P-Americas segment, the absence of fourth quarter inventory valuation benefits sequentially impacted first quarter results. Conversely, our I&D and Refining segments benefited from the absence of fourth quarter inventory valuation charges. In our fourth quarter teleconference, we outlined $105 million of first quarter estimated EBITDA impact from planned maintenance in O&P-Americas and Refining. Additional unplanned downtime from winter storm Heather in Houston and other events increased the first quarter estimated EBITDA impact from downtime by approximately $150 million. Our estimate for second quarter planned maintenance EBITDA impact remains at $30 million and is focused on a turnaround of one of the POSM units in Channelview.  We continue to align our operating rates with market demand to optimize working capital. During the second quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our global olefins and polyolefins assets and 80% for our intermediates and derivative assets. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim? Kimberly Foley : Thank you, Michael. After more than 35 years in various leadership positions at LYB, I am very excited to assume responsibility for our O&P segments. Earlier in my career, I was the site manager for our largest site here in Channelview, Texas. It is an honor for me to now lead LyondellBasell's work to grow and upgrade these core businesses for our company. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment. \u2013First quarter O&P-Americas EBITDA was $521 million. Lower feedstock and energy costs, coupled with stable domestic polyethylene prices, were offset by lower volumes due to planned and unplanned downtime. Olefins margins were supported by higher co-product pricing. As a reminder, fourth quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of $75 million. During the first quarter, the North American polyethylene demand continued to strengthen and, with the support of strong export markets, led to stable domestic prices despite new capacity entering the market. For the North American industry, domestic polyethylene sales volumes improved by more than 5% relative to the fourth quarter. The addition of new capacity to the North American market in 2023 has led to much higher exports from the region. During the first quarter, North American exports of polyethylene were significantly higher than 2023 average. For LYB, our strong domestic share in North America resulted in approximately 30% of our first quarter sales going to the export customers. In the second quarter, we expect feedstock and energy costs will remain relatively low, with LYB targeting higher operating rates following downtime in the first quarter. North American integrated polyolefin producers, including LYB, continue to benefit from a highly advantaged oil to gas ratio, leading to a significantly lower cost relative to oil-derived production. With the remainder of the U.S. polyethylene capacity now online, the market is well supplied, yet demand is keeping the industry inventories relatively balanced at about 40 days of supply. We remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demand. As Peter mentioned, we are focused on growing our circular and low-carbon solutions business to build our leadership in the attractive markets of premium recycled and renewable-based polymers. In February, we announced the acquisition of mechanical recycling assets from PreZero and Jurupa Valley, California. These assets extend our recycling footprint into the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area, providing good access to plastic waste feedstock in the region. We believe California offers a favorable backdrop to increase the recovery of plastic waste with better infrastructure, higher recycling rates and supportive policies. Please turn to Slide 12 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins  Europe, Asia and International segment. In the first quarter, higher volumes from near-shoring, combined with increased demand from restocking, drove improved results in Europe and Asia, resulting in EBITDA of $14 million. Additionally, throughout the quarter, logistical challenges in the Red Sea proved beneficial for local European producers, resulting in increased volumes and fixed cost recovery. In Europe, variable margins benefited from modest price increases that were mostly offset by higher feedstock costs. As we progress through the second quarter, we expect European Olefins and Polymers results to improve due to firm pricing, lower energy costs and improved seasonal demand. In addition, we continue to monitor the slow and gradual return of Chinese demand. Finally, we are staying true to our commitment to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our acquisition of the Saudi Arabian NATPET joint venture is expected to close in the coming months. The NATPET acquisition is an excellent example of LyondellBasell's strategy to drive long-term growth with advantaged assets. In line with our sustainability goals, we signed another renewable power purchase agreement of 208 megawatts of generation capacity in Germany. With this new agreement, LyondellBasell is rapidly moving towards our 2030 target to supply at least half of our electricity from renewable sources. We now have more than 90% of our 2030 target sourced through agreements for wind and solar electricity capacity. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results for the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $71 million. Fourth quarter 2023 results were impacted by LIFO charges of approximately $40 million. Improvement in the gasoline crack spread was partially offset by lower volumes related to planned and unplanned downtime. As previously mentioned, we have implemented a hedging program for a portion of our distillate production to mitigate risk throughout 2024. During the first quarter, distillate cracks outperformed expectations and our results include a mark-to-market losses for the program. In the near term, we expect seasonally stronger demand for gasoline amid rising crude oil prices. We intend to maximize crude throughput at the refinery, and operated approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the safe and reliable operation of these assets. We will continue to target high operating rates until ramp-down begins in the first quarter of 2025. Our team is evaluating several new projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron. Aaron Ledet : Thank you, Kim, and thank you, Peter, for the kind introduction at the beginning of the call. Like Kim, I'm honored to have the opportunity to lead the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. During my career at LyondellBasell, I have served in leadership roles touching on supply chain, APS, Europe, I&D, Refining, and most recently leading O&P in the Americas. I look forward to my new responsibilities to drive value creation and growth across the core businesses within Intermediates & Derivatives at LYB. Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. In the first quarter, segment EBITDA was $312 million. As a reminder, the fourth quarter results were impacted by LIFO charges of approximately $95 million. Our European propylene oxide and derivatives business benefited from logistics disruptions in the Red Sea, leading to near-shoring of local demand that drove higher volumes and margins in the region, a dynamic which has continued into the second quarter. In the first quarter, oxyfuels margins declined due to lower premiums for oxyfuels relative to gasoline. Despite these headwinds, oxyfuels margins remained more than double the level typically seen during the seasonally slow first quarter. Industry outages during the first quarter led to higher styrene margins that have since normalized in April. Looking ahead, we anticipate seasonal improvements across all businesses in the segment including benefits from the summer driving season and lower butane costs, providing support for continued strength in oxyfuels margins. In line with our guidance from the beginning of the year, we have planned maintenance underway at one of our POSM assets in Channelview, Texas. We expect higher volumes across most of our business following unplanned downtime in the first quarter. Our team continues to do a fantastic job in running our new PO/TBA facility with high reliability and utilization while ensuring superb product quality. After considering planned maintenance, we expect to operate at an average rate of about 80% of I&D capacity during the second quarter. The process to complete the sale of our ethylene oxide derivatives businesses to INEOS is well underway, and we expect to finalize the transaction in the second quarter. We anticipate a book gain on sale of $275 million, which will be reflected as an identified item during the second quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Aaron. Let's review the first quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. First quarter EBITDA was $35 million. Volumes increased 12% across our portfolio driven by improving seasonal demand and the lack of typical fourth quarter customers' downtime. Variable margins increased due to higher pricing and product mix improvements. This was offset by fixed cost investments during the quarter as we moved forward on our APS transformation. In the second quarter, we expect volumes will continue to show modest improvement benefiting from both seasonally higher demand and our growing pipeline of new business. We continue to see good momentum as we expand our growth funnel, with our team highly focused on winning projects with both new and existing customers. Utilizing both our recently acquired metal assets as well as our existing asset base, we are providing customers with innovative and sustainable solutions. We believe that our APS transformation, coupled with market recovery, will deliver results to reach the goals we laid out at our Capital Markets Day last year. With that, I will return the call back to Peter. Peter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, Torkel. And please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. First quarter EBITDA of $118 million reflected higher licensing revenue and improved catalyst margins. In the second quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will decrease, matching fourth quarter 2023 levels, but will be slightly offset by an increased catalyst volumes. As a result, we estimate that second quarter Technology segment results will be similar or perhaps, slightly better than fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 17 as we discuss the near-term market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect to see typical increases in seasonal demand along with some moderate improvements in markets throughout the year. In the Americas, improving export demand for polyethylene is expected to further tighten domestic markets. And additionally, low ethane costs should continue to strengthen integrated polyethylene margins. As we move through the year, we expect European markets will begin to see modest improvements. Industrial activity in the region is increasing, and we expect demand will continue to recover as long energy costs gradually improve confidence. The Red Sea logistics disruptions that bolstered first quarter demand continued to influence local purchasing decisions. China markets are exhibiting very slow but steady improvements. We're encouraged by China's targeted stimulus efforts and remain watchful for indications that these measures will deliver meaningful improvements in demand for LYB's products. For the packaging sector, demand for nondurables has been consistent. Given that destocking across the packaging value chain seems to be complete, we look forward to the potential for restocking ahead. In Building & Construction, we expect to see some benefits from moderating and perhaps falling interest rates and the inevitable recovery in demand for durable goods. In the U.S., stimulus funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will begin to support improving demand for commercial construction with growing benefits expected as the year unfolds. In the automotive sector, global production is expected to modestly improve from first quarter levels throughout 2024. Moreover, our APS segment is committed to strategic initiatives focused on winning back customers and growing the business. And in oxyfuels and refining, gasoline crack spreads are improving from the lows we saw at the end of the fourth quarter of last year. U.S. vehicle miles traveled have returned to pre-pandemic levels and the value for octane from our oxyfuels is strong. At LYB, we continue to optimize our assets on a global scale by aligning our operating rates to meet market demand and maximize cash generation. Now let me summarize the first quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy for the company, with Slide 18. As we move into the summer months, we anticipate seasonal improvements across our businesses in the second quarter. Moving through the year, we expect improvement in the second half driven by stable to lower interest rates and modestly higher demand. LYB's U.S. and Middle East production should continue to benefit from advantaged natural gas-based feedstock and energy costs compared to oil-based peers. Red Sea logistic disruptions were beneficial to our European businesses in the first quarter of 2024 and the time it will take for these tailwinds to fade is uncertain. As we mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings call, we are committed to delivering $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 through our Value Enhancement Program. We continue to see enthusiastic support for the program across the company as it becomes an evergreen part of our culture. Our team will continue to remain focused on advancing value creation through the 3 pillars of our long-term strategy. Progress continues on growing and upgrading our core businesses. In the coming months, we expect to close on the acquisition of our NATPET propylene and polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia. Our divestiture of ethylene oxide and derivatives business to INEOS is expected to occur during the second quarter. As we discussed today, LYB continues to build a comprehensive business model to support a profitable Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions business. LyondellBasell is making smart investments to build capabilities across every step of the value chain with a global scale in mind. With construction already underway for our first MoReTec advanced recycling assets in Germany, we're building on this momentum with FID for our second larger unit in Houston plants for 2025. Our actions demonstrate LYB's commitment to capture value with Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions. Our value enhancement program continues to grow and is a key element of our company culture. Currently, the program is on track to add up to $1 billion of incremental recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025, significantly surpassing our original goals. We're laser focused on our target to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. Now with that, we're pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : I'm interested in the level of demand that you're hearing from your downstream polyethylene customers for your renewable products, whether [Technical Difficulty] are they willing to sign a long-term contract [Technical Difficulty] in Houston, will you [Technical Difficulty] long-term contracts [Technical Difficulty] and do you expect these to be cost plus given how hydrogen requirements [Technical Difficulty] feedstocks. So just curious whether you think this would be cost plus. Peter Z. Vanacker: Steve, I mean, thanks for your question. This is Peter. It was a bit difficult, I mean, to understand the line was breaking up. But you were asking for our level of demand on the renewable side of polyethylene as well as if it is cost plus or not. Well, we continue to see very good traction in that market. You saw from our presentation that last year we doubled approximately the volumes of our Circulen family, so the mechanical recycles, the advanced recycles and as well the nonplastic waste renewables, so biowaste recycled products. We have -- continue to see very good demand in that regard. We see also that regulation is advancing, particularly in Europe. With regards to the contract structures, if we take our first investments in the advanced recycling technology, our MoReTec technology in the Cologne up in Wesseling, then we have a big part of the capacity already contracted. We, on purpose, do not contract the entire capacity because we believe there will be value that we can capture for that part that is not contracted once we start up the facility. We are not contracting on a cost-plus basis. I said that multiple times. These markets will have its own supply and demand, and that is actually what we currently are seeing. That means that pricing for renewable, recycled polyethylene, but also polypropylene, has its own price points that is being set in the marketplace. And all that we see is still very much aligned even ahead of what we had said in March last year at the Capital Markets Day. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Patrick Cunningham : So O&P-EAI seems to be seeing some nice benefits from volume trends and firmer prices, particularly in Europe. How do you expect prices to trend into the second quarter and throughout the year? And do you get any sense we may see some reversal in this near shoring and restocking trends that you've highlighted? Peter Z. Vanacker: Good question, Patrick. And of course, we are very pleased that we see that the situation is changing in Europe. Of course, as you alluded to and as we said in the prepared remarks, held by discontinuity because of the issues in the Red Sea. Generally spoken, and then I will hand over to Kim. Generally spoken, we see that situation not changing very rapidly because the behavior of our customers has changed, that they are buying more locally than eventually relying on cheap imports. So therefore, we expect, as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, I mean, to see further advancement in our profitability in that particular region in the second quarter. Kim, you want to add something to that? Kimberly Foley : I think the only thing that I would add, Peter, is we continue to see strength in packaging, which you alluded to in our prepared remarks. And none of us can predict what's going to happen with the supply chains, and so long as that threat is out there, I think we'll continue to see more nearshoring. Peter Z. Vanacker: And another topic that I want to point out is everybody has noticed that now in Europe, there is consolidation announcements in the market. So if you do the back-of-the-envelope calculation of, in total, now the 3 announcements that have been made, then we're talking about approximately 1.5 million tons of ethylene capacity, that in, let's say, relatively short term should disappear in the market. Another point that I want to allude to is that the average age of crackers in Europe is about 45 years, whereby in Europe and the United States it's less than 30 years. There are about 40 crackers in Europe, close to half of them have a capacity that is lower than 500,000 tons per year. So you see that restructuring is actually starting to happen in Europe. And if these announcements are being made, then we would expect also that is being taken into consideration in the value chain, that means our customers and customers of our customers, in where they want to secure their products. Having said that, we do not see yet in Europe that there is restocking. So what Kim was alluding to is mainly based upon higher demand because of higher consumption downstream of products being produced. So it's not yet restocking. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : And congrats, Kim, on the new role. Why don't we stay with Europe for a minute or two? First off, you indicated that global O&P operates, you expect that 85% in the second quarter. Curious what the split might be Americas versus Europe. But it does seem that the business is catching a break with the Red Sea issues. And to your point, Peter, you also indicated that you were starting to see some rationalizations and so forth. You have already taken some actions. Is there more that we should be expecting to happen in Europe? Theoretically, the threat in the Red Sea will be neutralized, and then we'll start to see the global trade flows again, and that will obviously appear to catalyze some actions. So any color there would be very helpful. Peter Z. Vanacker: Let me take the latter part of your question. Very good question, as usual, Frank. The latter part, I mean around our assets. You rightfully said, we took a very early step when the industry was not undertaking any steps yet, by rationalizing our polypropylene facility to 1 line in the southern part of Italy, in Brindisi. Of course, we've always said that we continue to look at all the different assets that we have in Europe, taking into consideration that we have flexible assets in Europe compared to some other assets that are still there in the industry that are not flexible, that are subscale, that were dealing with high costs, that we have a quite good position with our assets if you look at the cash cost curve in Europe. But nevertheless, as we said before, we continue to strategically evaluate our positions in Europe. As I alluded to before, we are quite positive by the dynamics around new regulation that supports the demand for recycled products. And therefore, we've also said, I mean, our Cologne assets were very strategic in that regard. We're building up our Cologne hub around, I mean, renewable polyolefins, around advanced recycling with the MoReTec investments. So that will continue to get a lot of focus as we move forward. On the short-term question with the Red Sea, anything that we can add, I mean, Kim? Kimberly Foley : I think I want to go back to the first part of Frank's question, just so I answer that. As many of you saw in the prepared remarks and the releases this morning, our first quarter North American olefins and polyolefins would operate at our crackers at about 75%. So you asked the question about operating rates for global OPAM. I would say OPAM or global O&P-Americas as well as global, Europe, Asia and International are both at 85% in the second half -- or the second quarter of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt. Matthew Blair : Could you go into your outlook for PE pricing in the second quarter as well as the back half of the year? Is it fair to say that the export demand right now is stronger than domestic demand for PE? And then also, could you talk a little bit about just overall inventory levels? Peter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, Matthew. Before I hand over to Kim, let me point out that we are, of course, very pleased to see that domestic demand in the United States has improved by 5% versus Q4 last year. Reminding everybody that this is the strongest quarter since Q3 2022. In addition to that, as you rightfully said, I mean, the export sales continue to grow, actually breaking records, for the fourth consecutive quarter, which is not so much a surprise if you see at the cost base and if you see the differential between oil and gas. So these are very good dynamics that we see in the marketplace for PE and for producers like ourself with a very low cost basis in the Gulf. Kim? Kimberly Foley : So Peter, I think what I would add to that, and it's hidden throughout our messaging today, is that domestic demand, as you mentioned, is up, export demand is up. Just to put numbers to your comment around year-on-year. Year-on-year PE exports out of North America are up 27%. So the new capacity that's now online is absolutely being exported around the world. Those channels to market are open. We're involved in all of those. And we're very optimistic now that we have our cracker back up in Corpus Christi, that we're going to be able to fulfill all those channels. So yes, as you think about it, we've got a high oil to gas ratio, we've got low energy. The U.S. is set with a very competitive advantage to meet the demands of the world. Peter Z. Vanacker: And a couple of points that I also want to outline here, if you look at days on hand and PE, it went down from Q4 to Q1, I mean, from 42 to 40. So you see there as well domestic demand going up, export sales, the topics, I mean, also that Kim highlighted. So we saw also that the capacity utilization [industry] despite, I mean, that we saw a lot of additional capacity being brought online, and we believe that most of that capacity is now producing, maybe a couple of exemptions there with some technical issues, but there is not a lot of major capacities in the United States that still need to come online. So we saw capacity utilization actually moving up to around 90% in PE in the United States. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : I have a 2-part question. Is the real break on polyethylene prices, the overcapacity situation in China? And do you think that what the market needs is either a tighter supply/demand balance in China or something moving China prices up in order for prices to really be affected positively in the other jurisdiction? The second part is, on Slide 11, under the our actions and talking about olefins and polyolefins America, you say balancing domestic demand with disciplined capacity utilization. What does that exactly mean? Peter Z. Vanacker: Let me go I mean to your first question, [ Josh ]. Indeed, as you rightfully pointed out, even if we have seen a little bit of an uptick in demand in China, I would make the case that everybody is bleeding. Margins are not where they need to be. Naphtha is expensive. And then the question is how long will that last? Because there may be newer facilities, of course, that can hold on longer, but there is also quite a lot of subscale capacities in China. And I'm sure after, how much, 12, 18 months of bleeding, even 24 months of bleeding, how long will that then last until we will see some actions being undertaken? But nevertheless, despite the fact, I mean, the China supply and demand is not where it should be, you see these exports from the United States into other parts of the world reaching breaking records. So the material finds its way then into other markets, markets where maybe also, again, older facilities, not backward integrated, not flexible, fully dependent on naphtha, these are the facilities, of course, that have been very difficult to be competitive. As a consequence, we continue to believe -- you've seen, I mean, the price increases at the beginning of the year. You saw the 2 rounds of price increases in the United States last year -- at the end of last year. We have these price increases out in the market, more April and May. And there's a very strong case, if you look at everything that is happening, for those price increases, I mean, to stick. If I turn to Kim on the second question. Kimberly Foley : Second question, I think the easiest way to explain that is it's an optimization. You're going to look at what margin you have on your domestic demand, you're going to look at your incremental cost of production to export, and you're going to make the right optimization across our assets? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Joshua Spector : I wanted to ask on the cost side of the equation. So I mean, you continue to make good progress on your Value Enhancement plan. But at the same time, you're investing to stand up a new business in CLCS. I think, correct me if I'm wrong, that's probably a big driver about why your SG&A continues to increase, up about $100 million over the last couple of years. So I'm wondering if you could kind of break the pieces apart in terms of the benefit from VEP you see yourself getting, the costs that you're adding for that new business maybe over the next couple of years that don't have the EBITDA to match that at this point, and maybe inflation, so we can maybe better model over '24 and '25 what the actual drop-through was of the savings versus cost versus new businesses. Peter Z. Vanacker: Let me go first, and then I hand over to Michael. Of course, I mean, we continue to be very pleased with our VEP program, the acceptance in the organization, the value that we have been able to create last year that we continue to see being created this year. We are very well on track, as I said, to reach or exceed our targets on the VEP for this year. I give you an example, I mean, because last year, mid-cycle margin value creation at the end of the year was slightly above $400 million. Bottom line, with effective margins and effective products being sold, for the year was around, I mean, $300 million. Well, a part of that $300 million, that's how the 3 pillars work, have been reinvested in building up the second pillar, and that is the business unit Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions. Not to complete amounts we have invested, but a substantial amount of that $300 million has been reinvested to build up that pillar and as such also more [Technical Difficulty]. That, of course, also leads, remember, we have bought out joint venture partners, we have done a number of bolt-on acquisitions. So of course, with that, of course, you get higher SG&A on your balance sheet. But all that is where it works together, I mean, the pillars in our strategy. Michael McMurray : Yes, Josh, and maybe just a few more comments in regards to cost. I think we have a pretty good reputation for operating lean, which we think actually gives us an advantage versus others. When times are good, we actually continue to be disciplined. Quite frankly, in 2023, I think underlying cost control was strong. SG&A as a percent of sales totaled 3.8%, despite revenue and cost headwinds. We also made investments in our footprint when we started up PO/TBA in circularity, as you noted, and VEP, and some capability building across the enterprise. And clearly, inflation was a significant headwind last year. And as we've moved into 2024, we continue to make some targeted investments, for example, in our CLCS business and our VEP program, where we will invest about $270 million this year. 1/4 of that is OpEx, 3/4 of that is CapEx. But again, we're managing well, and driving actions this year both in CapEx and in OpEx. And so I'd say, overall, cost control is strong, and we are making targeted investments, and you can continue to expect us to manage costs well going forward. Peter Z. Vanacker: And our portfolio management, of course, helps with that. I mean, as you know, we're almost, I mean, at the point of closing the divestiture of ethylene oxide and derivatives. And we're almost closed at closing our NATPET joint venture, and that triggers then, of course, also soon after that, a final investment decision to expand with an additional line with newer technology. So these things all work together, is what I wanted to highlight. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Peter, you obviously mentioned a couple of the joint ventures and you recently did, obviously, the NATPET sort of venture out in Saudi Arabia as well. Would love to hear your latest and greatest thoughts about where you guys stand in terms of potentially maybe consolidating the Sasol joint venture. Peter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, Hassan. Good question. As you alluded to, I mean, in Saudi Arabia, we have lots of activities ongoing, not just with the existing joint ventures, but then, of course, also with the NATPET joint venture and then the next step with the investment. We are happy, and actually, that deal was done before my time, so I'm even super happy, with the fact that we have entered in that joint venture with Sasol. I would say, generally spoken, operation is running well in that joint venture. We're pleased, I mean, with our position that we have in there. And of course, we continue, as we have said multiple times, to always look at opportunities in the marketplace where we can grow and upgrade the core. So we are not focusing now on just one thing, but we are continuing to look at growing and upgrading the core. Having said that, we have multiple times outlined that we will be extremely disciplined in our M&A activities. Michael? Michael McMurray : Yes. And maybe, Hassan, I'd say a couple more things. I think clearly, just looking back upon the last 2 years we've been much more active from a portfolio management perspective, both on bringing things in, but also jettisoning things where there are better owners. But I don't think it's appropriate for us as to comment on a specific transaction? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Peter, last March, or March of '23 I should say, you unveiled some financial goals around your CLCS initiatives, $0.5 billion in EBITDA by 2027 en route to $1 billion in 2030. I was wondering if you could speak to your level of confidence in the March toward the first piece of that in 2027. And part of the reason I ask is, it sounds like you may not take a final investment decision on MoReTec in Houston until next year. I'm not sure exactly how long that might take to build out. But maybe you could kind of speak to the timing and ramp of tonnage extending on what you show on Slide 6. How does that 123 kilotons maybe ramp over the next 2 or 3 years towards your medium- and long-term goals? Peter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, Kevin, for your very good question. Generally spoken, we continue to be very confident that we can reach what we have said a bit more than 1 year ago on C&LCS, but also on the overall targets that we had put out there, $0.5 billion on C&LCS 2027, and additional profitability. We are making very good progress, I mean, with the entire family. You saw that one particular slide, I mean, doubling the volumes, very good margins that we are generating for the entire family. We, as you know, Kevin, some of the parts go faster than other parts. So it's clear that the renew, CirculenRenew family goes faster because we have been in the market since a couple of years with the biowaste based polyolefins. The network that we have build up and continue to build up on the mechanical recycles, remember all the deals, and it's also on the slide that we did in Europe, and then also starting in the United States, is ramping up very fast as we had planned. And the advanced recycling parts, yes, of course, we have the first investment decision taken for the capacity in the Cologne hub. It's on track. Work is on the go, it's underway. The team is on the ground. We look positively on the time line that we have there, I mean, to reach what we had said starting up by the end of 2025. And we are now looking at, of course, the concepts, as we have alluded to and is in the slides, to double that capacity, bring, I mean, to Houston at the refinery sites, do the necessary work on the upgrading, looking at that from a technical point of view by leveraging upon our hydrotreaters that we have in the refining. So that one, I would say, you're right. I mean final investment decision not this year, but next year, and then it takes time to build. But in the meantime, what we are also doing is we are working up -- as, remember, we always said we will be technology agnostic. So we work together with different partners on the advanced recycling side. So as an off-taker of plastic oil, that we can either upgrade or move directly into our steam crackers. So from that perspective, it gives us the possibility to continue to grow with the advanced recycling polyolefins in the marketplace. So I have no indications that we would not be able to reach our targets. We continue to be very confident. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Can I just ask on the cash flow going forward, are we done with the working capital build? Or is there probably a little bit more of that to come in the second quarter? Michael McMurray : Vincent, it's Michael. Yes. Well, I'd probably answer the question in 2 ways. I think for the second quarter, it should be relatively stable. But I hope things actually get better in the second half when we consume a bit. But that said, I don't expect us to consume anything that's material? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. Peter Z. Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, everybody. Very good questions. But of course, I was missing a little bit questions around our propylene oxide business, our Oxyfuels business, and our APS business. Now let me highlight that the team is doing a fantastic work in all of these businesses. We're making very good progress, and we're moving, I mean, to driving season, which, as you know, is always good for oxyfuels, I mean, from an oxyfuels point of view. We continue to see early indications that durable goods demand is going up, which is, of course, also good for our leadership position that we have in low-cost and low-carbon footprint propylene oxides. And I'm also very pleased, as I said in the prepared remarks, by seeing how we are on track in the transformation of our APS business. Our win rates, our service level, these are things that we are looking at. And Circulen has seemed or making fantastic progress. So also very pleased with that, despite, of course, certain markets on a global basis, especially in durable goods, not being at the top level yet. So it is very promising when those markets also continue back, I mean, to sustainable growth. So thank you all for the thoughtful questions. And of course, we look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to make progress on our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend. Stay well and stay safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies the call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that can lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our investor relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer, our CFO Michael McMurray, Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins and Refining, Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives, and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results as well as updates on our long-term strategy. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Yet again, our people did an excellent job navigating challenging market conditions whilst being laser focused on the execution of our strategy. Let's begin with Slide three and discuss our continued leadership in safety performance. LYB has a history of excellence in operational performance, with safety being a core part of our success. Going back to 2010, we have consistently delivered industry-leading safety results. But more importantly, we have made significant improvements towards our goal to operate safely each day with zero incidents, injuries, or accidents. LYB's June year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.13. For comparison, in 2010, our incident rate was 0.42, more than 3x higher than today. Safety is foundational to what we do. Getting it right ensures the well-being of our workforce, but also benefits our operational excellence performance and financial returns. Our team has demonstrated outstanding focus to reach this point, and we remain committed to further improvements. Today, I'm excited to discuss our actions to deliver resilient results, as well as the excellent progress on our long-term strategy for LYB. Please turn to Slide four as we briefly review the quarter. Second quarter underlying business results improved by nearly 30% over the first quarter, driven by increased volumes from our operations. North American demand for polyolefins continues to improve, while feedstock and energy costs remain low. Our European olefins and polyolefins results improved due to our flexibility to increase our utilization of advantaged LPG feedstocks. Within intermediates and derivatives, the benefits from LYB's expanded PO/TBA capacity are clearly seen in our record quarterly oxyfuel sales volumes. Earnings were $2.24 per share, with EBITDA of $1.4 billion. LYB generated an impressive $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our strong cash generation provided support for the disciplined execution of our strategy. Let's turn to slide five and review the three-pillar strategy that is driving our focus on strategic growth and long-term value creation. As we described during fourth quarter earnings, we are making good progress on our goal to add $3 billion in incremental normalized EBITDA by 2027, with nearly one-third of that target unlocked during 2023. Last quarter we took a deeper look into how we are building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. Today we will describe the work underway to grow and upgrade our core businesses. When we talk about growing and upgrading our core, we are very clear about the criteria we use to define businesses that are core to our portfolio. Moving to Slide six, let's review these criteria. We are working hard to build up a portfolio that is focused on leading market positions and growing end markets that deliver attractive returns well above our cost of capital and leverages on access to advantaged circular and renewable feedstocks. You will see that once we have executed this transformation, we will be a much more profitable, focused and streamlined company. Our decisions on investing in organic growth or disciplined M&A are grounded by our commitment to pursue attractive returns well above our cost of capital. We are leveraging LYB's technology and global market positions to increase our access to advantaged feedstocks typically found in North America and the Middle East. And finally, as we covered last quarter, we're making great progress in building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. Historically, we've defined advantaged feedstocks as low-cost NGLs in North America and the Middle East. As we grow our CLCS business, we are expanding this definition to include favorable positions for circular and renewable feedstocks. As you know, we have implemented a lot of actions to grow and upgrade our portfolio in parallel with great focus and speed. May was again a busy month for us with the completion of the sale of our EO&D business and the acquisition of our stake in the NATPET joint venture. Importantly, we also announced a strategic review of some of our European assets that will reposition our footprint for future sustainable success. On Slide 7, let me highlight our goals for reshaping LYB by simultaneously growing and upgrading our core businesses. We are adding value through growth investments in, for example, our PO/TBA capacity and our formation of the NATPET joint venture in Saudi Arabia. We are also continuously evaluating projects and expect to find more opportunities that will be accretive for LYB. Our value-enhancement program is also delivering growth through incremental production capacity and improved margins. LYB's VEP is not a one-time cost-cutting initiative. Our VEP is our new way of working, focused on unlocking value and is becoming embedded in LYB's culture. Michael will share some more details on our VEP progress in a few moments. Our motivation for upgrading the portfolio is illustrated on the right side of Slide 7. In some cases, upgrades are accomplished by divesting or exiting non-core businesses. One example is the Houston Refinery, a capital-intensive asset that has historically only delivered brief periods of profitability. After we shut down the refinery by no later than the end of the first quarter 2025, LYB's average EBITDA margin will actually expand by about four percentage points. Our divested ethylene oxide and derivatives business did not provide LYB with a leading position and did not fit our criteria for growth. Simply put, we were not the best owners. The strategic review of our European assets will position our footprint for a sustainable future. All of these moves aim toward building a stronger, more focused and more profitable business portfolio for LYB. Let's drill into our European strategic review on Slide 8. We are undertaking this review to position LYB's regional footprint for future markets. Our goal is to reshape our European business portfolio in alignment with our long-term strategy for lasting success. Europe remains a core market for LYB. Our analysis determines that the six assets listed on the top left in their current configuration do not meet LYB's criteria for a core business. At this point, all options are on the table. Just like our ethylene oxide and derivatives business, these assets could well have a strategic fit and profitable future with another owner. Divestiture of the assets as a group or separately is a possibility. Or we may determine that, like our Houston refinery, rationalization is the best option for some sites. While it is too early to speculate on the outcomes, the impact on the company's global portfolio is relatively limited. As you can glean from the chart, the assets subject to review only represent about 13% of our global capacity for these product lines. LYB will continue to have a strong European presence. In I&D, our core European assets utilize LYB's world-leading PO/TBA technology. In Germany, we are investing near Cologne to build our first circular and renewable solutions hub. And our technology segment will maintain a strong presence in Italy and Germany. We will continue productive engagement with all relevant stakeholders at the impacted sites. This includes local governments, our business partners, potential buyers, and most importantly, our employees, who continue to demonstrate high commitment to safe, reliable and efficient operations, despite the ongoing uncertainty. Our aim is to move swiftly to maximize value for LYB and all stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael to discuss our financial results in more detail. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide nine. And let me start by discussing our resilient cash generation. Over the past year, LyondellBasell generated $4.4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at an impressive 95% cash conversion rate during the last 12 months. As a result, we were able to return almost $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This represents nearly 70% of our $2.6 billion of free cash flow, in line with our long-term target. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $2.9 billion. Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our second quarter capital allocation. As Peter mentioned, we generated an impressive $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we returned $513 million through dividends and share repurchases, while funding $484 million of capital investment. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $1.34 per share, continuing our track record of providing a secure, growing, and competitive dividend for our shareholders. Our team is committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation as part of our long-term strategy. During the quarter, we divested the ethylene oxide and derivatives business for $700 million. Within a few weeks, we invested approximately $500 million to acquire a 35% share of NATPET integrated polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia. We finished the second quarter with approximately $7 billion of available liquidity. In July, LYB successfully amended and extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to 2029, while further strengthening our liquidity by increasing the size of the facility by $500 million to $3.75 billion. Let's continue with a brief update on our VEP progress on Slide 11. The Value Enhancement Program is a highly successful and integral component of our long-term strategy. We are confident in our estimate that the VEP will contribute approximately $400 million to EBITDA in 2024. Our team is rapidly delivering value less than two years after first launching this program. To provide more detail on this year's progress, we have broken out contributions by business segment and category. As you might expect, the segment with the largest contribution is also our most profitable segment, O&P Americas, generating about $265 million of incremental value. In 2024, we anticipate approximately $280 million of benefit across the company from improved product mix and increased variable margins. We anticipate about $95 million of benefit from higher volume, driven by improving reliability and increased rates. While the Value Enhancement Program is primarily focused on increased value generation, the program has also identified opportunities to improve our leading fixed cost position. Overall, we estimate that lower fixed costs across our manufacturing and corporate functions will benefit our results by approximately $25 million this year. As Peter mentioned, LYB's VEP program is a new way of working and unlocking value that is becoming embedded as an evergreen process in our culture. Let's turn to Slide 12 and I will provide a brief overview of the results of each of our segments. LYB's business portfolio delivered $1.4 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter, almost 30% higher than the prior quarter. Seasonal summer demand, coupled with higher production from our asset base, led to increased volumes. Margins modestly improved across most of our businesses. In early July, Hurricane Beryl impacted our operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast. LYB proactively shut down some of our assets ahead of the storm. Our prudent approach reduces the potential for damage to our assets and the surrounding community during adverse conditions. As a result, we did not experience any workplace injuries and property damage was not material. Nonetheless, we estimate that storm-related downtime will impact third quarter EBITDA by approximately $65 million, with approximately 75% in our O&P America segment. We have relatively modest levels of maintenance activity planned for the remainder of the year. In the appendix to this slide deck, we provide updated 2024 modeling guidance for planned maintenance impacts and other financial metrics. With a sharp focus on working capital, we continue to align our operating rates to meet market demand. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets, 80% for our European olefins and polyolefin assets, and 75% for intermediates and derivative assets. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim. Kim? Kim Foley : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of the olefins and polyolefins America segment. During the second quarter, O&P America's EBITDA was $670 million. Increased LYB production led to higher volumes and margins. We were pleased to see that integrated polyethylene margins were supported by modestly higher ethylene and polyethylene prices, while ethane and natural gas costs remain low. Demand for North American polyolefins is strengthening in 2024, with June year-to-date industry polyethylene sales up by nearly 11% over the first half of 2023. Strong demand pull from both domestic and export markets is absorbing recent capacity expansions in the region. LYB is well positioned as the third largest polyethylene producer in North America, with strong customer relationships built over decades. In the third quarter, we anticipate continued seasonal demand strength. Low feedstock and energy costs are expected to persist, benefiting North American integrated polyolefin margins. Amid a backdrop of relatively high oil prices, the favorable oil-to-gas ratio provides an advantage to North American producers relative to oil-based production in other parts of the world. Despite disruptions from Hurricane Beryl in early July, the U.S. olefins and polyolefins markets remain well supplied. Nonetheless, the U.S. Gulf Coast hurricane season is still young, with potential for additional disruptions over the coming months. During the third quarter, we will remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demand, targeting 85% utilization. After a decade of unprecedented growth, North American polyolefins capacity additions have slowed down. Please turn to Slide 14 as you review the changing outlook for our new supply. In the early 2010s, the advent of shale-based oil and gas production triggered a wave of olefins and polyolefins capacity additions to take advantage of the abundant and low-cost NGL feedstocks. With one or sometimes two world-scale plants coming online nearly every year for over the past decade, North American domestic and export markets for polyethylene and polypropylene became well supplied, leading to reduced operating rates and lower margins. Over the next few years, very little new capacity will come online in North America. After two years of tepid growth, polyethylene sales volumes are growing at double-digit rates during the first half of this year. Demand growth in Latin America is increasingly served by North American supply. Polypropylene volumes are also improving, but remain constrained as we await the inevitable rebound in demand for durable goods. With North American demand growth returning to long-term trends and no meaningful local supply on the horizon, tightening supply and demand balances and higher utilization rates bode well for LyondellBasell's core polyolefins business. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the results of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia, and international segment. In the second quarter, LYB's integrated polyethylene margins expanded with the increased utilization of cost-advantaged feedstocks such as LPGs, resulting in EBITDA of $70 million. Approximately 40% of LYB's European ethylene production came from advantaged feedstocks. Additionally, higher prices for olefins and coproducts supported European cracker margins amidst modest seasonal demand improvement for polymers. Red Sea logistic challenges have largely subsided during the quarter, but significant higher shipping costs constrain European imports, benefiting local producers. Looking ahead, we anticipate steady olefins and polyolefins demand through the summer in Europe. In September, we will begin planned maintenance at one of our German crackers that will continue into the fourth quarter. As a result, we are targeting approximately 80% operating rates for the third quarter. As part of our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses, we completed the acquisition of a 35% share of the Saudi Arabian NATPET joint venture at the end of May. The joint venture currently operates 400,000 tons of integrated polypropylene capacity using local cost-advantaged propane raw materials and LYB's ferrous polypropylene technology. Together with our partner Alujain, we are evaluating opportunities to significantly grow the joint venture by leveraging new feedstock concessions in Saudi Arabia. And as Peter discussed, in May, we also announced the strategic review of some of our European olefins and polyolefins assets. Our team is working diligently to evaluate our options and order position LYB for future success in the region. Now let's turn to Slide 16 and review the results of the refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $15 million. Higher production following the first quarter downtime was more than offset by lower mire crack spreads. Margins decreased driven by lower distillate cracks, partially offset by slight improvements in gasoline cracks, with modest second quarter demand indicating a slow start to the driving season. Our hedging program benefited second quarter results. Industry operating rates remained relatively high, leading to ample market supply. In the near term, we expect summer demand to support stable gasoline crack spreads and continued high operating rates for refiners. We intend to operate at approximately 90% of capacity in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the safe and reliable operation of these assets until we shut down, no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. Additional details regarding our ramp down will be provided during our third quarter update. Our team is making good progress in evaluating projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron. Aaron Ledet : Thank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 17 as we look at the intermediates and derivatives segment. In the second quarter, segment EBITDA was $501 million, driven by increased production and seasonal demand for oxyfuels. We delivered record quarterly oxyfuels volumes by increasing production from our newest PO/TBA asset, which operated at close to benchmark rates during the quarter. Oxyfuels margins remain robust as the summer driving season is underway, with strong octane demand keeping margins well above historical levels. Intermediate chemicals improved due to higher margins and volumes for acetyls, driven by industry outages and improved production from LYB's assets. Propylene oxide and derivatives margins were steady, as demand for durable goods remain modest against a backdrop of high interest rates in the impacts of inflation. As we move through the third quarter, we expect seasonal demand will continue to benefit oxyfuels margins through the remainder of the driving season. Low costs for butane raw materials and steady premiums for octane should provide continued support for oxyfuels profitability. In line with our guidance, planned maintenance at one of our Bayport PO/TBA assets will begin later in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. We will continue to match our production with market demand and expect to operate our I&D assets at rates of approximately 75% during the quarter. As Michael mentioned earlier, we completed the sale of our ethylene oxide and derivatives businesses to INEOS for $700 million. During the second quarter, we recorded a book gain on the sale of $293 million, which is reflected as an identified item in our second quarter results. Our work to grow and upgrade our I&D segment continues as we evaluate our Maasvlakte POSM joint venture in the Netherlands as part of the ongoing European strategic review. We are working closely with our partner in the JV, Covestro, local stakeholders in our workforce. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the second quarter results for the advanced polymer solution segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $40 million. Margins increased across most APS businesses as our transformation work and seasonal improvements led to modestly higher pricing. Lower automotive production in Europe led to a slight decrease in volumes. Looking ahead, we expect modest improvement in volumes through the remainder of the year, driven by our strategic initiatives and focus on restoring our growth pipeline. We anticipate headwinds from typical seasonal downtime at automotive OEMs in the third quarter, but our master batch business assured a qualification cycles and offered more opportunities for near-term improvement. Our team is focused on continuously expanding our growth funnel and increasing the win rate with our customers. We're investing in our core team with a growth and value mindset to deliver on our long-term goals for the APS business. With that, I will return the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19 and I will discuss the result for the technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $84 million reflected moderating licensing and catalyst revenue, normalizing after strong first quarter results. In the third quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will increase, coupled with high catalyst volumes. As a result, we estimate that third quarter technology segment results will be similar to first quarter results. Now let me summarize the second quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy with Slide 20. LYB's second quarter results reflect higher production volumes and modest seasonal improvements in market conditions. Looking toward the second half of the year, we continue to expect a slight improvement over our first half results with a slow recovery in global markets. LYB's assets in the U.S. and Middle East are well positioned, operating in regions where low costs for energy and feed stocks provide a durable competitive advantage relative to oil-based production. Our team remains disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and delivering high returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet is in great shape and we are well equipped to succeed as market conditions modestly improve. Our value enhancement program is on track to contribute approximately $400 million to EBITDA in 2024. We are thrilled with the enthusiasm and results from our progress so far and look forward to providing a more substantive update on our VEP next quarter as we dive deeper on how we are stepping up our performance and culture at LYB. At our Capital Markets Day last year, we outlined our long-term strategy. Through leading technologies and market positions, we are executing on this strategy to grow our global footprint and upgrade our core businesses. Our strategy will not only grow LYB but will also reshape our business portfolio to improve profitability and create sustainable competitive advantages. As Kim highlighted earlier, we see North American polyolefin demand improving in 2024, returning to work long-term historical growth rates. As we look ahead, limited capacity additions in North America bodes well for continued improvements in operating rates and associated margins over the coming years. I am proud to lead our high-performing team as we take decisive actions to unlock value, reshape LYB, and position our company for sustainable future success. With that, we're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : You're planning to shutter the refinery at the end of the first quarter, and I know that you have considered some other options for that facility, such as becoming a plastic recycling center. I think you also offered it as a hydrogen hub. My question for you is, are any of those plans contingent on funding from the DOE, which could potentially get scuttled if there was an administration change? And can you provide a little bit of, I guess, transparency on that two million ton, 1 billion EBITDA target you have by the end of the decade? What type of circular products do you expect to be generating that? Peter Vanacker : Hi Steve, thank you very much for your question and warm welcome from my side. On the refinery, we have announced that multiple times and it's again in our prepared remarks that we plan at the latest to run down the refinery at the latest at the end of Q1 2025. In the meantime, our teams are making very good progress with regards, I mean, to a couple of projects that we have alluded to before. One of them is our second investment in MoReTec. The first one, remember, is in the Cologne hub next to our steam crackers in Wesseling. The second one we plan to bring to the Houston refinery. Leverage upon the hydrotreaters we have, modify those hydrotreaters so we can upgrade the plastic oil that is being produced in MoReTec number two. And that plastic oil would then be supplied to our steam crackers through pipelines in, for example, Channelview. So that's one project that is proceeding well. I hope that we will take a first decision, a first milestone decision on that still this year. The second project is around the renewable hydrocarbons. So these are not plastic waste type hydrocarbons, but hydrocarbons eventually produced out of used cooking oil or other wastes. We see also opportunities to leverage upon the equipment we have at the refinery to produce those renewable hydrocarbons as a feedstock in our refinery in Houston. And again, the same principle, those hydrocarbons would then go through our pipelines to Channelview, to the steam crackers, and then based upon that we would crack them and we would polymerize them. So we have then two elements of our Circulen family. One, the advanced recycling part based upon the MoReTec investment, and the other one, the renew part, which is based upon renewable hydrocarbons. So all that is proceeding well, as we had alluded to in the past. Michael McMurray : And hey Steve, it's Michael. I would say that a lot of the hydrogen projects are probably challenged without subsidies. And then before we move on to the next question, I wanted to clarify something. We received a lot of questions around our operating rates this morning from the materials that we had posted online. So let me see if I can clarify a few points for you all. In April, we guided to second quarter operating rates for the segment as 85% for both O&P Americas and O&P EAI, and 80% for intermediates and derivatives. Our rates for the second quarter were largely in line with that guidance. In the business results discussion posted on our website, we disclosed second quarter cracker operating rates were 95% for O&P Americas and 90% for O&P EAI. We operated our crackers in both regions at higher rates during the second quarter to capture favorable economics for olefins. Our polymer plants operated at lower rates to match second quarter market demand for polymers. As Kim and Aaron mentioned, during the third quarter, we will operate the O&P Americas segment at 85%, O&P EAI at 80%, and I&D at 75%. In O&P Americas, we proactively took some downtime during Hurricane Beryl that will reduce rates by about five percentage points for the third quarter. In EAI, we are starting a turnaround on our larger cracker and Wesseling during the third quarter. We expect our crackers in both regions will operate at higher rates than the segment to continue to capture attractive margins for ethylene, propylene, and other co-products. In I&D, we are performing a turnaround on one of our older PO/TBA plants in Bayport, Texas during the third quarter. In addition, we're taking some downtime at our POSM joint venture in the Netherlands to balance the low market demand for propylene oxide and styrene in the region. If you have any further questions on rates, please feel free to reach out to the IR team for further clarification. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : I have some questions on the PO side. So, you mentioned the benefits of the new PO/TBA plant in Channelview. Could you give us the approximate EBITDA contribution in the quarter or at least some guidance on how the run rate stacks up to your mid-cycle target of 400 million to 500 million on an annual basis? The release also mentioned some volume improvements in PO. Can you talk about which end markets are picking up? And then finally, can you talk about the supply-demand outlook here? I think there's a fair amount of new China PO capacity on deck for the back half of this year. Thank you. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Matthew, and welcome as well to you. On propylene oxide, if you talk about the new facility, the PO/TBA facility that we have successfully started up last year, I'm very pleased, I mean, to say that we ran close, I mean, to 90% during Q2 in terms of capacity utilization. I think that's based upon my 34 years in the industry. That's a huge success because that's a major investment that we have made to be able to run pretty much close to nameplate capacity of such a facility and such a relatively short period of time of ramping up. So with that, I will also hand over to Aaron to give a little bit more background on the market supply and demand. Aaron Ledet : Yeah, thank you, Peter, and thank you for the question. I would say that as we look at overall PO demand, as many of you know, most of it goes into durable applications with roughly two-thirds going into the polyurethane chain. We have not seen any rebound from durables, at least noticeable rebound from durables over the first part of this year. We don't expect it to rebound either in the second half of the year. We remain optimistic that the rate cuts will have an impact on us, although they won't be immediate. The other third demand for PO really comes through derivatives and glycols and BDO, and we're also, while glycols might be a little bit better than what we were anticipating, BDO remains somewhat modest. So generally speaking, PO demand is relatively modest right now. Peter Vanacker : I do want to add, I mean, just on the big picture, now we've alluded to that in the past as well, one needs to look at the total different capacities to produce propylene oxide, and still in the world, I would say approximately half of the capacities are based upon chlorohydrin technology, which is a technology that is older, has higher CO2 emissions, is more costly. And actually on January 8, 2024, the China National Development and Reform Commission, the so-called NDRC, announced a ban on most of the chlorohydrin-based PO technology by the end of 2025. So we estimate about 25% of China propylene oxide is chlorohydrin technology. So if you see that that is going to be banned, and you look at that compared to the additional investments in propylene oxide that have been taking place in China, it's probably going to, these rationalizations will partially offset, if not fully offset, I mean the new capacity in China. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Good morning. I had a question on the cash flow side of things, given the positive cash flow generation and solid balance sheet here, you dipped your toes back into the buyback markets here in the second quarter. Curious what your outlook is for the balance of the year there, and whether or not, there might be other scope for M&A, etc. So, just generally the uses of cash question. Thank you. Peter Vanacker : Of course, I'm very pleased, I mean, to say that the total capital return yield of Q2 was 6%. So I think that's very attractive. Michael, you want to add something on the question of Frank? Michael McMurray : Yes. So thanks for the question, Frank. I mean, just a couple of things. I mean, you know that we have a reputation as a company for delivering strong free cash flow and converting EBITDA into cash. In the last 12 months, we generated 4.4 billions, which is 95% conversion, which is well ahead of our 80%. And just kind of thinking about the year itself, as Peter alluded, we grew our dividend. And we did some buybacks as well in the quarter. As we look to the second half, I think buybacks will continue to be in the mix, probably somewhat modestly, so we're still being a little bit cautious. But from a long-term perspective, the 70% guidance of returning free cash flow to our investors is fully, fully in place, and we're fully committed to it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : I know Eastman has a very different circular plastics program than Lyondell. But would it seem that their operational initial problems, and they've got some delays in customer adoptions, would that be common, I think, to all circular plastics initiatives here? So is that giving you any concerns about your 2030 targets, 5.5 years from now is actually a pretty short timeframe for chemical investments. Peter Vanacker : John, welcome as well, and thank you for your question. Of course, technologies are difficult to compare, I mean, to one each other. What I can say on our MoReTec technology, we have a unit which is up and running in our Ferrara plants, where we also have our R&D people in Italy. So that is not an industrial scale plant, but it's not a lab scale either. It's not a small plant. I mean, this is about four stores, I mean, five, I mean, the plant. So we have very good experience, I mean, with that. The scope, I mean, on the MoReTec 1 investment has been finalized, and we're starting to prepare, I mean, on the grounds, on the investments. So that is proceeding well in Westerling, so for our Cologne hub. Our process is, as I said multiple times, is different than practically any other process that you find out there, because it is a catalytic process, leveraging upon our vast experience we have in catalysis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. Peter, in your expectation of higher second half results versus the first half, what are you betting for polyethylene price increases, and included specifically in July as well? Thank you. Peter Vanacker : Well, David, welcome and thank you for your question as well. I mean, if you look at the first half of this year, from a group perspective, of course, then Q1 was better than Q4 last year. Now Q2 was better than Q1. Quite impressively, I mean, 29% better than Q1. Another point that I want to make is, if you now exclude the refinery business, which, as we alluded to before in the call, is going to end its operations, it's a different environment in refining than what we have seen last year. So if you compare Q2 results without refining for this year with Q2 results without refining last year, then our results are better than last year. So the core business is improving as we are progressing. Now to your question on the second half of this year, if you look, I mean, what we alluded to in the prepared remarks, we expect that ethane will remain cheap. There are two $0.05 per pound North American polyethylene price increases in the market. Kim said practically all increased capacity in North America has been absorbed through demand growth as well as exports, record exports. We don't see any inventory buildup throughout the value chain. And we're only at the beginning of the hurricane season. So if you look at all these things, then one would expect that we have a very good momentum, and that should support, I mean, also price increases for polyethylene. We will have to see, of course, how much of the two times $0.05 per pound price increases are out there, but at least you see the momentum in the North American market, which should support, I mean, these price increases. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Peter, I appreciate the detail on slide eight regarding your ongoing review of the European asset footprint. Can you provide a little bit more color about, you know, how you arrived at these decisions, but perhaps more importantly, you know, which of the three buckets that you outline, you know, in terms of upgrading profit, divesting, or rationalizing might be more likely, and what does the timeline look like for the evaluation moving forward? Peter Vanacker : Thank you very much, Kevin. Good question. Of course, I mean, it's not a lot that in addition that we can disclose at this point in time, because we continue to keep all the options open, but as you know, we have made the announcement in the market, so by having made the announcement in the market, that allows us to also have discussions with potential other owners for those assets. I need to differentiate a little bit, like you saw on slide number eight. One part is around propylene oxide, so the POSM units that we have in the Maasvlakte, which is a 50-50 joint venture with Covestro. So that is a bit different, of course, than if you compare, I mean, to the cracker/PEPP sites that we have identified within the scope. So, progressing well, I would say, we're not excluding any opportunity that we have at this point in time, and one thing that I can say is, we are very diligent, we're laser focused, and we will not delay the actions that need to be taken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Chris Perrella : Good morning, everyone. It's Chris Perrella on for Josh. Taking a look at the second half guidance, the maintenance, thank you for the updated maintenance schedule, the maintenance looks relatively similar, half over half. I know there's the barrel impact. I was just trying to -- could you add some more color on sort of the moving parts? Is it a seasonal decline in the earnings, or weighing on the earnings in the second half, or what's slowing the momentum that you saw in the second quarter there? Peter Vanacker : Well, we continue to see that there is momentum being built up. I talked already a bit on PE, so if you look at PE, you see that just the U.S. domestic demand in Q2 was up by 4% versus Q1, which, just to remind everybody, this is the strongest quarter since two years. Exports were up, let's say, around 8%, 9% versus May and June, so they were, these exports, about the second highest, I mean, all time, and I alluded to the price increases that we have in the marketplace. The same is also a bit valid, I mean, on polypropylene, so we, I mean, demand continues to improve, of course we're still waiting for inflation rates to go down, we're still waiting as a consequence for interest rates to go down, so that consumer confidence would go up, especially for durable goods, but in polypropylene, we see that even if consumer confidence remains low, that there is a bit of improvements already in some other areas, like rigid packaging, seat, films. Our order book is also quite full on polyethylene and polypropylene, so we're happy with that as well. The main issue that continues to be is around China. China demand, we have seen slowly going up, we think around 4%, 5% locally, but that is being absorbed with the additional capacity that is coming on stream. Europe continues to be soft, but then there is some encouraging messages, numbers that we see, especially on the southern part of Europe, the southern countries with higher GDP growth, higher demands, and we see that inflation rates continue to slowly go down in Europe as well. So if you look at everything together, we see a slow increase, a continued increase in terms of demand, so if you talk about these capacity utilization percentages, and Michael made some clarifications on that, it's not so much, I mean, for the second half of the year, because we see and we are worried about demand growth, it's mainly because of our own actions that we have, because if you have a scheduled turnaround on our big cracker that we have in Wesseling in Europe, well, of course, I mean, that gives you lesser capacity that you have available. But rest assured, I mean, we continue to see continuous slow, but good momentum, steady momentum in terms of demand creation. Michael McMurray : So flattish to Q3, slightly up second half versus first half, and then Chris, that seasonally, the first and fourth quarters tend to be the weakest, with seasonally, the second and third, the strongest, just as a reminder. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Joined the call late, so apologies if this question's been asked before. But you know, a question around the I&D side of things. Historically, the EBITDA in that segment used to be quite stable. And then over the last year or two, there was some volatility there as well. And obviously, you guys saw a nice bump up in EBITDA this quarter, partly obviously driven by the oxyfuel side of things. I'm just trying to sort of suss out what, how you guys think about the sustainability of these profitability levels. And historically -- a continuation of the historically sort of steady, eddy nature of this business. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Hassan. Thank you for your question. I made a couple of remarks. I mean, it was more around propylene oxide. But maybe I hand over since I have Aaron also in the room here, and he's heading the I&D business, as you know, that he can make a couple of additional comments around the PO, the oxyfuels business. Aaron Ledet : Yes. Thank you, Peter. I appreciate it. And thanks for the question, Hassan. I point to a couple of different things. I agree with your comment about IND historical earnings being very steady. We sold the EOD business in the second quarter. So you have to consider removing that from that profile. However, we've added the PO/TBA facility and we're now operating that facility better than planned rates close to benchmark. As I look forward, given the challenges that we're currently seeing with durable demand, specifically in automotive, housing and construction, we are optimizing our PO assets according to technology. We've already talked to the benefit that we see with PO/TBA. And that's why we're running all of those assets close to benchmark with POSM assets being more like swing assets to meet supply with demand. And when you're looking specifically at possum, we would actually prioritize our U.S. assets, just giving our cost position. And that's why the comment that Michael made earlier on PO 11 being idled in August, it's reflecting current demand in the region. That being said, I still expect that IND remains steady going forward. I mentioned earlier in my answer to the previous question that with interest rates potentially coming down, we do see some potential upside. That's not currently built into our forecast and it won't be immediate, but we do see some potential upside there. Peter Vanacker : Of course, we're very well positioned because we have that new PO TBA plans that is running very well. So if durable good demand starts moving up, then we have the capacity available to fulfill the demands. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : I just want to dive in a little bit more into polypropylene dynamics. I mean, it seems like U.S. supplies are telling you towards the end of the decade, but you have seen increases in other regions of the world. So just in terms of how you're thinking about the supply and demand dynamics on that front, as well as your current use of feedstock costs would be particularly helpful to hear you think about the business as we go into 25. Thank you so much. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Chris. I mean, before I hand over to Kim, let me elaborate also that we saw -- despite the fact, I mean, that really durable goods is demand is not really yet going up substantially. But domestic demand in the United States for polypropylene was up about 5% versus Q1, which means that this is the strongest quarter in polypropylene that we have seen since Q3 2021. So with that, Kim. Kim Foley : So Peter, I guess what I would add to that is when you when you ask about the overall kind of global dynamics, you've seen a lot of growth in polypropylene, specifically in China, over the last couple years. So what you're seeing play out is more of a regional market, you're, it's much less of an export market than what you see in polyethylene, polypropylene, you know, just to compare and contrast polypropylene, you may export 8% to 10% in the US versus polyethylene, where it would be more like 40% or 50%. So it's a much more regional dynamic. And that dynamic is based on the feedstock to your question around feedstocks. So what is your cost of propylene in different parts of the world, whether you're getting it from refining, whether you're getting it from on purpose PDH units. And then the thing that's really an interesting dynamic in North America, specifically right now is the reliability of that supply of propylene. There's been a lot of PDH capacity that's been brought online, as people have been phasing out propylene coming out of elephant crackers as they've gone to lighter ethane feedstocks. So you see on purpose PDH, having reliability problems, and you're seeing higher, what we would call propylene grade, polypropylene causing the problems. So I hope that answers your question. I apologize. There were some other things going on here in the room. Chris Parkinson : All good. Very much so. Thank you so much. Peter Vanacker : And Chris, we also have a spread improvement price increase. I mean, that is on the table in the market for North America for July of three cents per pound on polypropylene. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes to the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Turner Hinrichs : Hi, this is Turner Hendricks on for Vincent. It looks like in EAI, you ran at 60% NATPET when I think you can run typically with more propane. Was that because there were attractive NATPET co-product values or something else? Kim Foley : Yes. Your simple answer is yes. There were very good co-product values, especially in butadiene, as well as we felt that that was the best optimization of our European crackers at the time. As we've said in the past, and, you know, we'll just reiterate it because I think it's very important, whether it's in Europe or in the U.S., we are always looking week to week to optimize the feedstock slate of our crackers and produce the best value for LYB. It's not always ethylene. Sometimes it's the co-product. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn back over to Mr. Vanacker for closing comments. Peter Vanacker : Yes, thank you very much. Excuse me. Thank you again for all of the thoughtful questions. Let me maybe still articulate a couple of key messages of this call. I believe that we are making excellent progress on our strategy to make LYB a much more focused company with a leading advantaged asset portfolio, as well as product mix. And why am I saying that? I mean, first of all, we're making good progress on our goal to add $3 billion in incremental normalized EBITDA by 2027. Secondly, you see that we have clear actions to increase our historical average EBITDA margin from 18% to above 22% percent. Third, our second quarter due to capital return yield at 6% that we have due to an increased dividend and also some share buybacks is, I think, quite state-of-the-art. And fourth, our current cost advantaged operations in feedstock advantaged regions without our refining is already about 60% of LyondellBasell's production volume. And after we have implemented our European strategic assessment, we expect that that will grow to around 70%. So let's say in a couple of years. So, of course, we look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to make progress on all aspects of our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend. Stay well, stay healthy and stay safe. Thank you very much. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies the call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides in our regulatory filings, which are also available in our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and earnings per share excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins & Polyolefins and Refining; Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates & Derivatives; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results as well as updates on our long-term strategy. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results. And yet again, our people did an excellent job navigating challenging market conditions while remaining laser-focused on the execution of our strategy. Our low-cost footprints in the Americas and the Middle East continued to perform well to capture profitable growth in olefins, polyolefins, propylene oxide and oxyfuels. Let's begin with Slide 3 and discuss our continued leadership in safety performance. LYB's success in operational performance starts with a core focus on safety. Our GoalZERO commitment is to operate safely with zero injuries, zero incidents and zero accidents. Our focus is demonstrated by LYB's September year-to-date total recordable incident rate of 0.13. We are very proud of the continued commitment to safety from our people. Our company is exceeding the safety performance of the top quartile peers in our sector. Please turn to Slide 4 as we briefly review the financials for the quarter. Our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to generate value despite very challenging market conditions. A sharp decline in gasoline crack spreads drove sequentially lower quarterly results for refining and oxyfuels, but we were able to run our newest PO/TBA assets at nameplate capacity. Strong ethylene margins and outsetting cracker utilization allowed our Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment to post a 13% sequential EBITDA improvements, the strongest quarter for the segment since the second quarter of 2022. As a result, earnings were $1.88 per share with EBITDA of $1.2 billion. LYB generated $670 million in cash from operating activities, maintaining strong cash conversion on a weaker profit base. Our return on invested capital remains above our cost of capital, and our cash conversion remains robust. We continue to advance our long-term strategy with good progress during the quarter. On Slide 5, we highlight one of these milestones. In September, we started construction of our MoReTec-1 facility in Wesseling, Germany, our first commercial scale plant utilizing LyondellBasell's proprietary catalytic advanced recycling technology. The investment is a clear indication of our commitment to European brand owners and OEMs. German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz and other top officials attended the events to demonstrate solid governmental support. The innovative nature of our proprietary technology has been underlined by the fact that the EU Innovation Fund awarded MoReTec-1 a \u20ac40 million grant. MoReTec-1 is expected to start up in 2026 with capacity to produce 50,000 metric tons per year of cracker feedstocks, recycled from hard-to-recycle mixed plastic waste. The recycled feedstocks will be used in our existing olefins crackers and produce high-value circular polymers that are indistinguishable from fossil-based polymers. Our proprietary MoReTec technology is unique with a plastic to plastic yield of more than 80%, low energy intensity, the ability to utilize 100% renewable electricity, and half of the carbon footprint compared to fossil-based feedstocks. As a leader in the market today, we continue to see healthy margins for our recycled and renewable based polymers given the strong demand and limited supply for these materials. This profitability is core to the second pillar of our corporate strategy : to create a profitable Circular & Low Carbon Solutions, or CLCS business. We continue to expect annual CLCS incremental EBITDA of $1 billion by 2030. As we build our first integrated hub in Germany, we are also planning our second integrated hub for Houston. Please turn to Slide 6 as we discuss the future of our Houston refinery site. We continue on our path to close the refinery by the end of the first quarter of 2025, another strategic milestone for LYB. We're exiting a volatile, low-margin business to focus our resources and opportunities for sustainable value creation. Kim will discuss the financial implications of the refinery closure later in the call. On this slide, we outlined three projects under consideration for the future of the refinery site. The first project, subject to a final investment decision is to utilize a portion of the site for a second larger MoReTec unit. We expect that MoReTec-2 will be twice the size of our German plants with the capacity to produce 100,000 tons of cracker feedstocks. We plan to leverage upon our existing hydrotreaters at the refinery and retrofit them. This will allow us to upgrade both the recycled feedstocks coming from our MoReTec-2 unit and feedstocks from third-party suppliers for use in our olefins crackers for the production of circular and low carbon CirculenRevive polymers. The second project under consideration is to retrofit some of the other refining assets to produce renewable and bio-based feedstocks. These feedstocks would also be used in our existing olefins crackers for the production of circular and low carbon CirculenRenew polymers. And with a substantial array of utilities, laboratories, pipelines, storage, logistical assets and other infrastructure on the 700-acre site, the refinery provides ample opportunity for investments and partnerships to support LYB's continued growth in low-carbon feedstocks and products. Although crude refining at the site will end, we have several opportunities to repurpose the site to capture sustainable value. We are leveraging our existing cost-advantaged assets to satisfy growing market demand for Circular & Low Carbon Solutions. I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our financial progress. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7, and let me start by discussing our cash generation. Over the past year, LyondellBasell generated $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at a 77% rate over the last 12 months, broadly in line with our long-term target of 80%. Difficult market conditions have persisted, pressuring our third quarter cash generation. However, we see potential tailwinds from lower global interest rates and economic stimulus measures in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect cash generation to improve. In the third quarter, we were able to maintain strong shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases totaling almost $1.8 billion over the last 12 months. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $2.6 billion. Despite being at a challenging point in the cycle, our balance sheet remains robust with less than two turns of net debt to EBITDA and available liquidity of $7.3 billion. Let's continue with Slide 8 and review the details of our third quarter capital allocation. As Peter mentioned, we generated $670 million of cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we returned $479 million through dividends and share repurchases, while funding $368 million of capital investment. Our team remains focused and committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation, especially during difficult market conditions. We are expanding profitability with high-return investments in our value enhancement program. We expect to unlock $600 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of this year and contribute $400 million of EBITDA during 2024. We are on track to shut down refining operations with valuable options for the future of the site. And to grow and upgrade our core, our European asset review is well underway and we are gauging market interest for the five olefins and polyolefins assets that we discussed last quarter. Let's turn to Slide 9, and I'll provide a brief overview of our segment results. LYB's business portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Lower crude prices and gasoline crack spreads led to lower profitability for both the Refining segment and the oxyfuels business within the I&D segment. The decline in these two businesses exceeded the sequential net decline in profitability at the consolidated group level. Improved ethylene margins and our strong cracker operations from our O&P-Americas segment provided upside. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim? Kim Foley : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 10 with the performance of the Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. During the third quarter, O&P-Americas EBITDA was $758 million, up 13% quarter-on-quarter and 50% year-on-year. Integrated polyethylene margins were supported by low ethane and natural gas costs, coupled with higher polyethylene prices following the successful July price increase. During the quarter, the industry experienced increased cracker downtime, which led to lower ethane cost and tighter ethylene supply supporting olefins margins. LYB's U.S. crackers ran at 95% rates during the quarter, which includes the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in July. Our strong operational performance allowed us to capture the opportunity for favorable margins with our merchant ethylene sales and benefited integrated polyethylene margins. We estimate that the additional profitability from our merchant ethylene sales alone offset approximately $50 million of estimated EBITDA impact from Hurricane Beryl. The segment's third quarter profitability exceeded last year's results by 50% and reached levels not seen since the second quarter of 2022. North American industry demand for polyolefins continues to exceed 2023, with September year-to-date polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes up 7% and 4%, respectively. Industry exports of polyethylene are up 11% September year-to-date, with 46% of North American industry sale volumes sold in export markets. LyondellBasell's U.S. polyethylene business holds a stronger domestic market share than our local peers, with only 26% of LYB September year-to-date polyethylene volumes exported. As such, we did not experience any material disruptions during the brief port strike. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate the typical seasonal trends of softer demand and customers' desire to minimize year-end inventories could constrain price increase initiatives. In addition, sequentially, higher natural gas and ethane prices are likely to pressure integrated margins. Nonetheless, as of this week, our October North American polyethylene orders are the strongest we've seen so far in 2024. Despite volatile oil prices, the favorable oil-to-gas ratio continues to provide an advantage for North American producers relative to oil-based production in other parts of the world. LYB remains well positioned as a leading producer in North America with strong customer relationships built over decades. During the fourth quarter, we will remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demands, targeting 85% utilization across the segment with higher cracker utilization offset by lower polypropylene rates giving the ongoing soft demand for durable goods markets. Please turn to Slide 11, as we review the results of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the third quarter, demand in the markets served by our O&P-EAI segment remains stable with no indications of macroeconomic recovery likely for the remainder of this year. The segment generated EBITDA of $81 million. Volumes declined as we began a planned turnaround at our largest cracker in Europe. Segment EBITDA improved sequentially as lower fixed and feedstock costs led to a higher integrated polyethylene margin. In the European market, we are seeing increased talk of strategic evaluations and capacity rationalizations across our peers. As in the U.S., we expect seasonal softening of demand for olefins and polyolefins. The drive for minimizing year-end inventories will also pressure European markets. In China, we are encouraged by the recent stimulus initiatives, but we have yet to see where the initiatives are resulting in improved market demand. Operationally, planned maintenance at our large Wesseling cracker in Germany will continue into the fourth quarter. As a result of this planned maintenance and softer seasonal demand, we are targeting operating rates of approximately 60% during the fourth quarter. We continue to make progress on our strategic objectives in O&P-EAI segment. Our European review is underway. In addition to starting the construction of our MoReTec-1 in September, we also acquired full ownership of APK in October, allowing us to integrate APK's unique solvent-based low-density polyethylene recycle technology as part of our comprehensive portfolio for building a profitable CLCS business. Now let's turn to Slide 12 and review the results of the Refining segment. In the third quarter, lackluster demand and high industry operating rates compressed margins and resulted in an EBITDA loss of $23 million. Crack spreads for both gasoline and distillate fuels declined during the quarter. Our distillate hedging program offset some of the margin declines. In the near-term, we expect further margin compression as the Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads continue to fall. We intend to operate at approximately 90% of capacity in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations as we move forward shutting down the refinery during the first quarter of the year. As Peter outlined earlier, our team is making good progress in evaluating strategic projects to transform the refinery site in support of our growth strategy. We have also kept the impacts of our people top of mind throughout this transformation. Since 2022 when we announced our intention to shut down the refinery, we have carefully managed staffing levels. As our staffing requirements decreased following the shutdown, we intend to retrain and redeploy as many affected employees as possible for the next stage of their careers with LYB. Nonetheless, some employees will end up leaving our company, and we will comply with all applicable laws and support our people as best possible. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and outline more details on the operational and financial impacts from that refining exit. Following the holiday season, we plan to begin shutting down the first crude and coker train during January of 2025. Then in February, we expect to begin the shutdown of the second crude and coker train, the FCC, and other ancillary units. This staged approach is designed to ensure a safe, orderly and responsible shutdown of these complex operations. The refinery shutdown impacts both earnings and cash flow. We have been accruing costs related to the shutdown on our income statement, since we announced our intentions in April 2022. However, once the shutdown begins in 2025, we will begin to realize the cash impacts depicted on this slide. During 2025, we expect to release working capital that more than offsets the cash cost of shutting down the refinery. We expect a net cash benefit of approximately $175 million during 2025, assuming a Brent crude price of $80 per barrel. We expect the Refining segment will be reported as discontinued operations from the first quarter of 2025. Within discontinued operations, the ongoing costs related to the former Refining segment are expected to be less than $50 million a year. These are the estimated costs for keeping the site safe, while maintaining operational capability for selected assets and infrastructure. With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron. Aaron Ledet : Thank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In the third quarter, segment EBITDA was $317 million, a decline of $184 million driven by a material decrease in raw material margins for oxyfuels. Oxyfuels margins fell on the declining gasoline crack spreads and slightly higher prices for butane raw materials. Our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business encountered headwinds due to volatile prices for propylene feedstocks and volume impacts from Hurricane Beryl and planned maintenance. While we are encouraged by the potential for lower interest rates to drive recovery in PO&D demand from durable goods, we do not expect markets to materially improve during the remainder of 2024. Our Intermediate Chemicals business was impacted by declining styrene margins due to ample market supply. During the quarter, our newest PO/TBA asset ran very well. And although volatile fuel markets negatively impacted this quarter's oxyfuels results, we believe the fundamentals for this business remain supportive. Our proprietary PO/TBA technology produces oxyfuels from butane at a sizable discount to crude oil used in gasoline production. Global demand for octane and gasoline remains strong, and our oxyfuels provides some of the highest octane levels for all of gasoline blend stocks. We expect our PO/TBA assets will continue to provide a world-leading cost advantage for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. LYB is well positioned to capture opportunities from demand growth and high cost supply rationalization. As we move through the fourth quarter, we expect lower seasonal demand across most of our I&D businesses with oxyfuels margins remaining low, consistent with seasonal norms. In line with our guidance, planned maintenance at one of our Bayport PO/TBA assets will continue into the fourth quarter. We will continue to match our production with market demand and expect to operate our I&D assets at rates of approximately 75% during the fourth quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the third quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $19 million. The APS segment faced weaker demand, particularly in the automotive sector where third quarter global production dropped by 5% from the prior year. The automotive downturn created substantial headwinds for both volumes and pricing. Despite these market headwinds, APS continues to grow through improved win rates in critical markets and improved manufacturing efficiency. As for the third quarter year-to-date, APS EBITDA is up by more than 20% over 2023. Resilient demand from packaging markets allowed us to grow year-to-date volumes and margins in our masterbatch business relative to the first nine months of last year. And we are now realizing the cost benefits from our effort to rationalize 18 APS manufacturing sites around the world over the past six years. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on earning additional high value business by further improvements in our Net Promoter Scores and win rates with customers to restore our growth pipeline. In addition, the APS team continues to optimize working capital to improve cash flow from the business. We're investing in our core team with a growth and value mindset to deliver on our long-term goals for the APS business. With that, I will return the call back to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA of $69 million was lower than the guidance we provided during the second quarter telephone conference. The lower results were due to several customers not achieving the licensing milestones that were expected to occur during the third quarter. But these milestones are on track for the fourth quarter. Catalyst volumes improved on the stronger U.S. demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect modest improvements in licensing revenue will drive slightly higher sequential results. Now let me share our views on our key regional and product markets on Slide 17. In line with our earlier comments, we expect that typical seasonal demand patterns will result in lower fourth quarter profitability across most of our businesses with the potential for improvements deferred until 2025. In the Americas, polyolefin demand is improving relative to 2023. While U.S. natural gas and ethane prices have increased since August, North American costs remain quite favorable on a global scale and should continue to benefit integrated polyethylene margins. Within Europe, market demand remains muted, but stable. We see limited downside from typical reductions in seasonal demand. Indications of near-term market recovery remain elusive, but we are watchful for the potential for demand improvements resulting from lower interest rates. Pressures from prolonged trough conditions and the need to reinvest in aging assets are likely to reshape the European chemical industry. Several peers are following LyondellBasell's leads and announcing programs to transform their European footprint through asset sales, capacity rationalization and other actions. These initiatives are likely to result in a smaller European supply base that is better aligned to serve future local demands. Chinese markets are slowly, but steadily improving from levels far below pre-pandemic conditions. We continue to monitor the impacts of recent stimulus initiatives and remain watchful for catalysts that could benefit demand during 2025. In packaging markets, we continue to see steady demand with some customer discrimination in favor of affordability. In building and construction markets, U.S. stimulus programs are driving increased investments in infrastructure and lower interest rates and pent-up demand are expected to provide tailwinds to both industrial and residential activity. Within automotive markets, production slowed during the third quarter as OEMs took seasonal downtime and higher inventories curtailed production. Demand is expected to remain muted during the fourth quarter as customers wait for lower borrowing costs and steeper discounts. And in oxyfuels and Refining, we expect that third quarter concerns over a weaker demand for fuels in China and strong refinery utilization rates will continue to pressure gasoline crack spreads. Margins are likely to be further constrained by lower seasonal demand. Our focus remains on strong operations and optimization across our global footprint to capture market opportunities. And as Michael emphasized, we are laser-focused on robust long-term cash conversion. Now let me summarize our outlook and our long-term strategy on Slide 18. The third quarter proved to be more challenging than expected, with markedly lower oxyfuels and refining margins only partially offset by improved North American olefins margins. Given the lower third quarter results, we now expect that our profitability for the second half of the year will be lower than our first half results. During the fourth quarter, we expect the impacts from slow global growth will be compounded by softer seasonal demand. Despite these challenges, our North America and Middle East integrated polyolefins production should benefit from low natural gas and ethane prices relative to higher cost oil-based production in other regions. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and working capital management. Our clear investment criteria and resilient core businesses allow us to remain focused on executing our strategy throughout the cycle. The company's balance sheet is in great shape, and we are well positioned to capture opportunities as they arise, we are upgrading our portfolio through our European strategic review and the exit of our Refining business. At the same time, we are growing core capabilities to create sustainable value through investments in Germany and additional plants underway for Texas. And our value enhancement program is on track to unlock at least $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by year-end 2024 and $1 billion of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. Our strategy will not only grow our company but will also reshape our business portfolio to improve profitability and create sustainable competitive advantages. I am proud to lead this dedicated team as we take decisive actions to unlock value, reshape LYB, and position our company for sustainable future success. Now with that, we are pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. I wanted to follow-up on some of the comments that were made about the North American polyethylene market. And in particular, I believe it was stated that October has the strongest orders year-to-date, but there were some other comments around the same time about sort of expecting the typical seasonal slowdown and that sort of hindering potential price achievement. So there's a little bit of a tension between those two ideas that customers are loading up now and in October, ahead of maybe price declines later on. So what do you think is causing that strength in orders that you're having the best order book of any month of the year in October? Peter Vanacker : Good question, Vincent. Thank you very much. I think we need to look also a little bit to understand October, I mean, to September. And September was a little bit slower compared, I mean, to the two months before. So there's a bit of an overhang in orders from September that we actually see coming in October. But as said, I mean, we do expect, I mean the seasonality as usual towards the end of the year, November and December, that there will be working capital management along the value chain. With that, Kim, anything you want to add? Kim Foley : I would just make a couple of additional comments, Peter, specifically around North America. I mean as we alluded to in our prepared remarks, right, you saw a feedstock advantage with ethane going into July and August. And then you saw industry down, so you saw a spike in ethylene price that challenged integrated margins. So a lot of customers looked at, as they entered September, they looked at, okay, where is ethylene price and integrated margin is going to go from where they were, and we also see a fall in crude price. So they were optimistic that the crude price would continue to fall and they would see export pricing compete with domestic pricing. And as you've seen over the last couple of weeks, the crude pricing has stabilized more. And you continue to see the demand is there for both exports as well as domestic. So that's why there's that tension and that's why October is so strong. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. I think Aaron alluded to the volatility on PO and derivatives. Now that you're running new asset fully, how much of the decline in the quarter was related to unplanned downtime versus weaker variable margin? And what were overall operating rates in the quarter? And then in terms of 4Q, do you still expect similar levels of maintenance here, or is that an additional drag sequentially? Aaron Ledet : Yes. Thank you for the question, Patrick. I'd say, listen, despite the challenging market environment, the positive takeaway is that sales are up 4% globally year-over-year through the third quarter, with all of the growth really coming from Europe and the U.S. Higher propylene prices in the U.S. are actually limiting exports to Asia. So you see that impacting our operating rates. And as we look to the fourth quarter, that's where the quote of 75% comes from. That is impacted, as mentioned in my planned remarks, by the Bayport turnaround, which we've just recently started up here at the end of October. As we look forward, we're still optimistic that the interest rate reductions and the stimulus packages will have some favorable impact on durable demand, but it's not likely to occur in 2024. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Peter, just on polyethylene pricing, do you expect polyethylene prices to decline in the fourth quarter? Peter Vanacker : Hi, David, it's a good question, of course, yes. And I'm going to pull up my crystal ball. You know that we have two additional price increases in the market, $0.03 per pound for October, $0.03 per pound for November. A bit premature to say because, at the beginning of November, as you know, discussions are ongoing to see if price increases will be successful or not. If I look at the underlying demand, and Kim alluded to that, domestic U.S. demand being up by 6% year-to-date, being up by 4% compared to last year; capacity utilization were above 85%; exports up by 11%; good demand in October that we just explained, or Kim explained. So we remain hopeful that we will see part of the price increases go through. But as said, it remains to be seen because these discussions are currently ongoing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. I think on your Analyst Day in 2023, you thought that -- or Lyondell thought that the normalized EBITDA of the U.S. Olefins and Polyolefins business and the European Olefins and Polyolefins business was $7 billion. And since that time, there have been capacity additions and Asia, China has slowed down. Europe's energy prices have come up. I think you want to exit part of your European business? What do you think is the normalized EBITDA of the U.S. and European business now? Is it still $7 billion or is it a different number? Michael McMurray : Jeff, what I'd say is the number for our North American business is largely unchanged. When we did our Analyst Day, we probably didn't have full visibility as to what is going on in Europe. And so I think as we sit here today, if you think about what's going on in Europe with higher cost energy and the regulatory environment, that, yes, probably Europe, the earnings power is a little bit lower than it had been in the past. Kim Foley : I think there's a lot of moving parts in the macroeconomics, that you also have to contemplate what will happen with China stimulus, and will it be able to consume the new capacity to bring online. What will happen as the EU starts to rationalize? You've seen some of the announcements out there. And then in North America, you have to remember, it's the lowest cost from a feedstock perspective, for sure, region of the world, and we have no new ethylene capacity coming online for a few years. So you have to take all that into consideration as well. Peter Vanacker : Yes and the other part that I want to add to that is, of course, our big transformation that we are going through, the elements that we have with the exit of the Refining on one hand side, but especially also the European assessments that is currently ongoing, and then our investments in the Middle East. So our portfolio of the past is not going to be the same as our portfolio in the future. We're repositioning in Europe, as you know, leveraging also upon the demand from the OEMs, the brand owners in circular and renewable solutions. We're doing the necessary investments in our Cologne hub. We see that regulation is moving in Europe in the right direction. We're building up low-cost delivered positions in the Middle East. So that means that our future portfolio of cost advantage operations will move from about 60% to 70%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the ATK acquisition -- sorry, APK. What's the degree of maturity of this technology? And is it ready for additional investments for capacity expansions perhaps in the near future? Peter Vanacker : Aleksey, thank you for your question. Well, noticed, I mean, that we have now full ownership over the company, APK. We're very pleased, I mean, with that acquisition because we had expanded our entire portfolio of renewable and circular solutions leveraging upon different technologies from waste-based renewable hydrocarbons to mechanical recycling to our MoReTec technology, which is an advanced chemical catalytic recycling technology. And now we also have with APK a solution-based recycling technology, which allows especially laminated films to be recycled. So we're in the process of integrating that company. We've acquired them because we see a huge benefit that they have because they are, in our view, the most advanced technology company in terms of solution-based recycling. So of course, as we are integrating them, we have a plan behind it in -- which one may compare a bit, I mean, to our MoReTec investment. So looking at applying the technology, looking at scaling up the technology. So if you fast forward it, I mean, to 2030, it will be an integral part of our total offering that we have to brand owners and OEMs. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Spector : Yes, hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a more longer-term question about the U.S. asset mix over time. So if you look at your cracker feed that you disclosed in this last quarter, you're about 95% light between NGLs and ethane. I guess as you look at converting the refinery site, and you talked about bio-based feedstocks, other recycle based feedstocks and what you're building yourself, what do you view is that cracker mix being, call it, five, six years from now? And assuming that's higher in terms of heavier feed tomorrow versus today, that's going to derate your crackers a little bit on the ethane or ethylene side, would you invest to maintain that or would you accept that shift as part of that change? Thanks. Peter Vanacker : Yes, hi, Josh, very good question. Of course, the first thing that I want to outline, and then I hand over to Kim is with the transformation that we're doing on the Refining side, we are coming from the markets. So we're coming from the demand that is coming from brand owners, OEMs through the value chain to us, demand for renewable and circular solutions. And as we are looking at that demand and how it is growing, mid- to long-term, that's how we are basing, of course, our asset strategy and the investments of, for example, a MoReTec-2 facility with upgrading capacities through the hydrotreaters as we alluded to in the prepared remarks. So it comes from demand how we are ramping up, I mean, those capacities. And of course, those capacities, those liquid fractions with, of course, also due to our MoReTec technology, there's also a gas fraction will be fed into our crackers, especially, I would say, the one that we have in Channelview. So it's not that we're coming from Channelview and we're changing the mix in the cracker, but we're coming from the market and building up our MoReTec technology to then see how can we actually feed it into our crackers and capture that margin that we have alluded to in the Capital Markets Day, the incremental margin over time. Kim, do you want to add something? Kim Foley : Yes, just a couple of comments. So thanks for asking, Josh, because it gives us the opportunity to again reemphasize this is a small investment to get into these product lines, these advanced circular product lines, by just putting a front end to our existing liquid flexible crackers, right? So when we think about how we operate in North America, I also want to reiterate, it's always about optimization, what we look at or refer to as our cost of ethylene. So yes, could we run 100% ethane at Channelview? Yes, we could, but we won't, because we -- it's more profitable for us to run some NGLs, just like it will be more profitable for us to look at the feed slate as we better understand the different feedstocks that will come in from circularity. So I think it's a great question. I really appreciate it. And I would just highlight, we had tremendous feedstock flexibility and the opportunity to get into a new market in a low cost way. Peter Vanacker : One of the beauties, I mean, that I think is in our strategy, Josh, is also the fact that, like Kim alluded to, it's a relatively small investment when you compare it to having to invest in a complete new cracker with everything around it. So it's leveraging upon our existing infrastructure. I mean CO2 emissions are also included, of course, in the steel and iron that you're building. So leveraging upon the existing infrastructure that we have, and mainly focusing on what do we need to add, yes, so waste sorting is something that we need to add. Advanced chemical recycling is something that we need to add to with our proprietary technology, the MoReTec technology. We don't need to add hydrotreaters in Houston, because we have them. We just need to modify them. So the investment compared to a fully blown up new cracker is substantially lower, and it allows you to be in a market that allows us to be in a market with low carbon footprint molecules up to net zero. And at the same time, also circular products. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Thank you and good morning. Peter, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the timelines in terms of the European restructuring. And to that end, did I understand you correctly that following this process, your expectation is that your European operating rates would increase by 10%. If you could talk a little bit about what's going on. What's your outlook for your European operating rates and again on the restructuring actions you're taking there? Thank you. Peter Vanacker : Yes, thank you, Frank. Good question. First that I would like to highlight is some of us here around the table are now around 35 years in the chemical industry. I've seen multiple cycles in the chemical industry. This is actually the first time in my career that I have seen that people are not just talking about restructuring and taking capacities out in a certain region, but it's actually happening, and it's happening faster that I believe that anybody, including advisers, consultants have anticipated. We are now somewhere between 2 million and 2.5 million tons depending on what timeline you take of ethylene capacity that has been announced that is being taken out in Europe. And some consultants have alluded to the fact that there should be somewhere around 2.5 million, 3 million tons, I mean to have again a balanced market. So it is in that environment that we have very early at an early stage started with the European assessment and make the corresponding announcements. So at this point in time, we are in the markets. We are looking at several opportunities. And we've alluded to that as well before, that can be selling the entire package of five sites in O&P. It can also be restructuring those sites. It can also be selling one or two or three sites, or selling them separately. So we are in the market. And we're expecting that we will get in 2025 quite a lot of clarity. So of course, as usual, we'll keep you informed about the progress, but it will take a little bit of time. These things, they don't go, as you know, I mean, from today to tomorrow. What I was alluding to before, the 60% to 70% is not because of capacity utilization or what. I mean I was saying that if you look at the total portfolio that LyondellBasell has in terms of cost-advantaged operations, so cost-advantaged assets, today this is around 60%, that is cost advantaged assets. After exiting the refinery and modifying it for our recycled renewable products, and after having exited the six operations that we talked about in Europe, that then our portfolio would consist out of 70% cost-advantaged operations. So the remaining 30% of costs -- the remaining 30% is pretty much assets that are serving our renewable and recycled strategy. Michael McMurray : Frank, congrats on the Jets beating the Texans. Frank Mitsch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Michael Sison : Hey, good morning guys. So thinking about polyethylene this year, integrated margins have done really well in the $0.30 per ton range, costs are low. And as you've noted, it sounds like demand is pretty good. So what needs to get better, I guess, in 2025 for O&P-Americas to grow EBITDA given how well, it seems like the polyethylene has generally done well this year? Peter Vanacker : Well, Mike, first of all, demand needs to continue to go up in PE. Today, demand by PE -- demand growth, I mean, PE is not so much related, I mean, to durable goods as inflation rates have gone down, as interest rates were expected to continue to go down, then we would hope that that will have an impact on consumer confidence, buying of apartments, houses, for the construction business would go up. And that would have a benefit, of course, both to the PE business as well as the PP business. Plus in addition to that, of course, also Aaron's propylene oxide business. So the other thing I want to allude to as well is if you look at year-to-date this year, the delta in EBITDA versus year-to-date last year, well, about 70% of that delta is coming from the Refining business. So next year, we are exiting the Refining business, that will be discontinued operations, so that will not be in the mix anymore, which gives you an indication as well that the rest of the businesses compared to last year, despite the fact that we haven't seen durable goods picking up. Europe still being in a crisis, China not having picked up, has been relatively stable. And the other 30% is pretty much, I mean, related then, of course, also to the impact that lower gasoline cracks have on the oxyfuels business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Thanks very much. Maybe a two part question on your refining transition. First, I appreciate the detail on Slide 13. Nice to see the net cash flow contribution. One question would be, as you throttle down on refining, should we anticipate any earnings impact on your other segments? Just thinking about products, co-products, utilities that may move across the fence, so to speak. And then secondly, as you... Peter Vanacker : Nothing that's material. Kevin McCarthy : Nothing material? Okay, good. Okay. And then if I may, are you still looking at a final investment decision on MoReTec-2 by March or so, Peter? Peter Vanacker : No, it doesn't go that fast, Kevin. And we hope it goes that fast, but it doesn't go that fast. So what we would look at, I mean in first quartile next year is that we make one important step, the first step, let's say in the investment cycle. This is not a final investment decision yet. But it's the first step, which would lead, of course, then also to starting to order long lead items, preparing the ground, do some infrastructure, et cetera, et cetera. FID, I would -- for the final step, I would expect that to happen in 2026. One thing already that I want to outline a bit here is that our investment strategy has changed, and we are in -- our concept is a modular concept that we have, which is something we are applying in the first MRT investment in Cologne. And we would do the same in the second investment in Houston. So that means, if we make that step on deciding on the first step for Houston, it already is an important commitment. It's intrinsic I mean to the nature of doing modular investments. So it is a higher commitment already in terms of total CapEx. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Peter. I just wanted to go back to the European review. Several questions, obviously asked about that. I mean since you guys obviously announced the review, and clearly, you guys were amongst the first to do so, more and more companies are coming out and doing that. And I'm still sort of trying to sort of understand how you guys will create value doing that, how you balance out sort of asset sales. Presumably now there will be more and more of a glut of assets being set up to be sold out there. So I would imagine pricing would go down, because of that. And obviously, Europe being Europe, shutdowns can be quite pricey over there. So I mean, how do you think about the calculus behind that? Peter Vanacker : Hassan, if I look at the announcement that so far have been made in the industry for Europe, then the 2 million tons or 2.5 million tons, depending on the timeline you take that I have mentioned before, are shutdowns. So they have been announced as these assets will be shut down. The assets that we are talking about in our portfolio are not bad assets. I mean, they are good assets. They are like take Bayer, for example, is a flexible cracker. Yes, it has integrated, I mean, polymerization next to it. So it has a good location from a logistic point of view. It has the preferential electricity costs, because of the nuclear industry that you have in France that is being supported, and we'll -- we expect will continue to be supported as well, if you look at current discussions on a European level. So we do believe that there may be good owners, I mean, for those assets, not necessarily that we are the right owner, I mean, for those assets. And you'll see the transformation that I mentioned before. We are investing and have very good experience in Saudi Arabia. So we continue to progress on that investment strategy in the Middle East. Michael McMurray : And what I'd say is that, so the process is underway. I hope you all appreciate. We can't share an incredible amount of details. But there will be more to share in the new year. But probably not early. Operator : Thank you. And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to Mr. Vanacker for closing comments. Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you all. Of course, as usual, very thoughtful questions. Let me highlight the following. I mean we continue to make excellent progress on our strategy to make LYB a much more focused company with a leading advantaged asset portfolio and product mix. You heard me saying that a couple of times in this call. Now 2025 will, for us, be a very important transformational year. We highlight a couple of the things that we are executing in 2025. I mean, first, we exit our Refining business and we start preparing for the transition into a renewable and circular hub. Second, we execute on the European asset assessment. Third, we progressed on our first MoReTec investment in Germany and we prepare for the second one in Houston. Fourth, we prepare for carbon value creation projects in our existing large assets, not building new assets, but the existing large assets. And fifth, we continue to further develop our Middle East footprint. So all these actions, as I mentioned during the call are expected to grow our asset portfolio of cost-advantaged operations from the current 60% to 70%. And as we mentioned in the last earnings call, we step up our mid-cycle EBITDA margin by doing so. Let me highlight as well that we provided industry leading 6% total capital return yields in Q3 as well. So of course, we look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to make progress on all the aspects of our long-term strategy. We hope that you all will have a great weekend. Stay well and stay safe. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Sir, you may begin. David Kinney : Thank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at investors.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides in our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and earnings per share excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today until March 2nd by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both members is 13746203. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our current CFO, Michael McMurray; our incoming CFO, Agustin Izquierdo; Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins & Polyolefins and Refining; Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates & Derivatives; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results and progress on our strategic initiatives. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. I'm very proud of how our people navigated challenges, leveraged our strengths and remained laser-focused on our strategy throughout a year that was not easy for our industry, particularly, the fourth quarter. Let's begin, as we always do with our safety results on Slide 3. During 2024, our employees and contractors demonstrated their commitment to outstanding safety performance. I am proud to share that our total recordable injury rate for 2024 was 0.13, our second lowest year for the company. Even more impressive, as LYB continues to grow, we achieved the lowest number of injuries in our history. This truly is a testament to our GoalZERO commitment to safety and operational excellence. With such an impressive safety record, I would like to take a moment to highlight some of the amazing milestones we have reached this year. We celebrated six sites, surpassing 10-plus years of no injuries, and our APS segment had record-breaking safety performance, reducing their incident rates by 39% compared to 2023. Operating safely is a prerequisite to achieving high reliability and creating shareholder value. I applaud our team for what we have achieved in 2024 and look forward to carrying this momentum into 2025 as we continue to strive for GoalZERO performance. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to discuss our financial results. There is no getting around it, 2024 was another challenging year for petrochemicals. However, in spite of the headwinds, our strategic focus on value creation, maximize cash generation, and delivered solid returns to shareholders. Earnings were $6.40 per share with EBITDA of $4.3 billion. LYB generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations with an outstanding 90% cash conversion ratio. We returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. Now let's turn to Slide 5, and take a moment to reflect on where LYB and the industry are in the current cycle. Across our key businesses, fourth quarter industry margins are about 60% of historical averages, underscoring the depth of the current downturn. Let me share three thoughts on this challenging environment : first, this deep and prolonged downturn is not permanent. Global demand for durable goods will inevitably return following this post pandemic downturn; second, LYB has the potential to capture substantial upside from the cyclical recovery in volumes and margins; and third, LYB's strategic progress in unlocking incremental value could enable us to surpass our historical cycle performance. The opportunity is apparent in our sizable polypropylene business, where fourth quarter margins are less than 50% of historical averages. And operating rates are at least 5 to 10 percentage points below industry norms, reflecting the severity of the downturn. For polyethylene, the margin compression is smaller, but the higher unit margins for the integrated value chain provide meaningful upside. In contrast, our oxyfuels business is currently experiencing typical fourth quarter seasonality. But the recent peak seen in 2023, when full-year margins averaged $560 per ton, provide a measure of the upside available for this business. We recognize that certain dynamics represent more than just typical cyclical pressures. They also reflect some structural shifts in the industry relative to prior cycles. Slower global growth, particularly in China, structurally higher energy costs, regulatory impacts in Europe and other regions, along with the potential for capacity additions to outpace demand have introduced sectoral challenges. These shifts are contributing to the depth and duration of the current downturn and will likely moderate future mid-cycle margins relative to the prior decades. This is why our strategic initiatives to unlock sustainable value across our portfolio are essential. These actions are enabling us to pivot to high-value opportunities and respond more effectively to changing market dynamics. Our focal points during 2025 were the transformation of our Houston refinery, the strategic review of select European assets and strong execution of our global operating model. We are confident that these actions will lead to a durable uplift of our EBITDA margins and provide lasting benefits for navigating future cycles. Now if you turn to Slide 6, we highlight the progress on our strategy during 2024. In nearly two years since our Capital Markets Day, LyondellBasell has unlocked approximately $1.3 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA through the execution of our three-pillar strategy. With focus and urgency we are leveraging our strengths and extending our advantages. The successful start-up of our PO/TBA plant in 2023 is adding approximately $450 million on a mid-cycle basis to our normalized EBITDA by leveraging our proprietary technology and advantaged feedstock positions in these attractive markets. And I'm very pleased to report that our value enhancement program is exceeding our expectations. In 2024, the VEP unlocked a year-end run rate of more than $800 million of recurring annual EBITDA improvements while contributing approximately $600 million to the 2024 EBITDA. In addition, we successfully completed the divestment of our non-core EO&D business, leveraging the sale proceeds to strengthen our portfolio by acquiring a 35% share in net NATPET a cost-advantaged integrated polypropylene joint venture. During 2025, you can expect additional progress towards capturing value through our strategic priorities. We are confident in the progress of our VEP program and expect to exceed our goal to achieve a year-end run rate of $1 billion of recurring annual EBITDA improvements. As you have seen, our APS transformation has encountered headwinds from automotive production declines at some of our key customers in North America and Europe. But the improved customer focus of our APS team has allowed LYB to increase our win rate for new project approvals. And Yvonne's team is doing an excellent job in growing volumes in our circular and low-carbon solutions business, while our exit from the refining business remains on track. At the same time, we are remaining extremely disciplined in how we allocate capital during this downturn by carefully prioritizing high-return capital projects and remaining steadfast to our highly selective approach towards M&A. As Michael will share, our capital expenditures will be lower than our prior guidance, but we have been mindful to ensure our prudence does not meaningfully impact future growth. And you can be assured that we will not compromise our M&A discipline to fill growth targets with risky or marginal acquisitions. On Slide 7, we provide an update on the growth of our circular and low-carbon solutions or CLCS business. We continue to build CLCS through a focused strategy that leverages our existing infrastructure and our competitive advantages, such as innovative technologies, and leading positions in growing markets with a global network of deep customer relationships. Our CLCS business continues to grow at an impressive pace. CLCS volumes increased by 65% during 2024 to over 200,000 tons across product lines based on mechanical recycling, chemical recycling and renewable feedstocks. And we are generating attractive margins that are incremental to our fossil fuel-based polymers. Our CLCS business is targeting $1 billion of incremental EBITDA from 2 million tons of annual volumes by 2030. Despite the challenges in the chemical industry over the past year, our 2024 CLCS margins and volumes are on track with our 2030 plan. Please turn to Slide 8, and let's take a look at our updated views on the supply and demand picture for circular plastics. Market demand for circular plastic remains robust. Consumer preferences and brand owner commitments to increase utilization of recycled plastics or driving demand growth. And European regulation is bolstering demand by mandating increased utilization of recycled content in plastic packaging. But this transition to circularity takes time. Infrastructure for plastics waste collection and sorting needs to be built. Large companies like LYB are developing technologies and building assets to increase supply, while smaller companies are having mixed success in improving new technologies and launching businesses. We believe capacity growth will continue to be outpaced by rising demand. As brand owners discovered the supply of circular plastics is not keeping pace with their growth plans they are pragmatically deferring their targets for utilizing circular plastics. And some brand owners have revised previously ambitious targets to more realistic levels after considering the supply constraints. Demand growth is merely being delayed due to lack of capacity, but not being eliminated. As such, LYB and other industry observers are incorporating these constraints by scaling back 2030 forecasts for industry capacity and the addressable market. The mega trends and investment thesis remain intact. The market for circular plastics is expected to be short of supply and supportive of attractive margins for quite some time. LYB strategy has not changed, the construction of our first MoReTec chemical recycling facility in Germany is progressing well, and we are planning MoReTec-2 for Houston with regional hubs for sourcing and sorting plastic waste in both locations. We are leveraging LYB's technologies, operations and global marketing network to execute our strategy and build a leading position in these attractive markets. Please turn to Slide 9. Let's briefly review the evolving regulatory framework for circular plastics in Europe. While consumer preference is a dominant driver for circular plastics, forward-thinking regulation in Europe is also strengthening demand growth. In Europe, we see a regulation moving in the right direction with PPWR, the new packaging and packaging waste regulation. With mandatory levels of recycled content in packaging, we expect PPWR will drive meaningful incremental demand for circular plastics on the order of 4 million to 5 million tons by 2030, and even more by 2040. LYB is well positioned through its differentiated technologies and solutions to take advantage of this growing opportunity. Contact-sensitive packaging with circular content is likely to require polymers produced using chemical recycling. Our proprietary catalytic MoReTec technology currently under construction in Germany will provide a profitable commercial scale solution. Before I turn over the call, I would like to take a moment to share my appreciation for our CFO, Michael McMurray. As we previously announced, Michael has decided to retire in line with his personal plan, after five years of service to LyondellBasell. Michael has been an incredible friend and thought partner over the past three years as we developed and executed a new strategy for the company. In addition, Michael provided outstanding leadership for our global finance team, wise counsel to our commercial leaders and oversaw the recapitalization of our balance sheet to look in the most favorable rates and maturities we are likely to see in our lifetimes. Chief, I thank you for your leadership and look forward to continuing our personal friendship for many years to come. Michael McMurray : Peter, thank you for your kind words. You have also been a great friend and partner over the past three years. Thank you. I also want to thank my team, my colleagues and our Board. The last five years have been fun, rewarding and challenging, and much has been accomplished. LYB is a great company with great people, and I'm confident the company is positioned for continued success. I look forward to following LYB's progress over the coming years. And finally, on my 50th and last earnings call as a public company CFO, I thank all of you in the investing community. It has been a good ride. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Michael. I'm also pleased to share that our Board has selected Agustin Izquierdo to become LyondellBasell's next CFO effective March 1. Agustin joined LYB in 2022 after 13 years of service in various commercial and financial roles at BASF and nearly a decade in Morgan Stanley's Investment Banking division. More recently, Agustin was responsible for LYB's O&P-Americas segment with full P&L responsibility. Prior to that, he was a member of the IND leadership team. We are also pleased that Agustin is LYB's first CFO to have been promoted from within the company. We aim to continue developing top talent across all levels of the organization as we step up our performance and culture. Agustin is with us here today. Would you like to say a few words, Agustin? Agustin Izquierdo : Certainly, Peter. I am humbled, honored and thrilled for this opportunity. And I would like to thank our Board, LYB's Executive Committee and the entire finance organization for their warm welcome. I look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and working to build on Michael's strong foundations to drive results for LYB. Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Agustin. Michael, can you please continue with a few words about our progress on capital allocation? Michael McMurray : Absolutely, Peter, and good morning again, everyone. Let's continue with Slide 10. As Peter mentioned, we are laser-focused on advancing our strategic priorities while maintaining a robust balance sheet that serves us well throughout the cycle. At the same time, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. During 2024, we invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures, carefully prioritizing projects to balance investment and future profitability. Our acquisition of a 35% position in the NATPET joint venture was offset by the divestment of our non-core Ethylene Oxide and Derivatives business. We ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and $8 billion of available liquidity. Our strong cash conversion enabled us to maintain a resilient balance sheet and fully fund $1.7 billion in dividends and $195 million in share repurchases. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7%, marking the 14th consecutive year of annual dividend growth and continuing our track record of providing a secure, growing and competitive dividend, and we are well positioned to extend our track record of growing our dividend in 2025. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged, and we remain committed to returning 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over the long-term. Please turn to Slide 11, and let me begin by highlighting the strong cash performance from our business during 2024. Over the past year, our business teams generated $3.8 billion of cash from operating activities. Cash on hand remained flat for the year at $3.4 billion. During 2024, we achieved cash conversion of 90%, well above our long-term target of 80%. In addition to typical fourth quarter drawdown of inventories, the company was able to pull forward the release of some of the working capital provided by the closure of the Houston refinery. During the first quarter, we will utilize some of our cash on hand to rebuild lean year in inventories in support of our upcoming Channelview turnaround and seasonal improvements across our businesses. In the U.S., tax relief associated with Hurricane Beryl, allowed us to defer cash tax payments during the second half of 2024, and these tax payments will be settled during February 2025. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the quarterly results of each of our segments on Slide 12. LYB's business portfolio delivered $689 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Sequentially higher ethane and energy cost and lower seasonal demand impacted both of our O&P segments. Overall, olefins and polyolefins demand remained soft, particularly in Europe, where utilization rates remained low. Additionally, margin compression on declining gasoline cracks and oxyfuels impacted profitability within the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In 2025, refining activities will be reported as discontinued operations and our financial results will be reported under the five remaining segments. The fourth quarter included identified items of $852 million net of tax. The items included non-cash write-downs related to our O&P Europe, Asia and International and Advanced Polymer Solutions segment of $769 million and $42 million, respectively, and costs incurred from plans to exit the refining business. The impairments reflect the challenging market conditions for these businesses and include O&P EAI assets in our European strategic review and an Asian joint venture, while the APS impairment was incurred in our specialty powders business. Across the portfolio, a non-cash LIFO inventory valuation charge decreased pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $23 million. As a reminder, our fourth quarter LIFO reconciliations reflect changes in inventory valuation over the full-year. The LIFO reconciliation is not necessarily linked to our fourth quarter valuations. Before we discuss our segment results in detail, let me discuss our capital expenditures plan for 2025 and beyond. Given the difficult operating environment and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are deferring some growth investments until later in the decade. For 2025, we expect our CapEx will be approximately $1.9 billion. Our 2025 capital plan includes approximately $700 million for profit-generating growth projects and $1.2 billion of sustaining investments to keep our assets running safely and reliably. The reduced capital plan prioritizes strategic investments in our CLCS business, our second tranche of flex capacity and high return projects in our value enhancement program. We expect our 2025 effective tax rate will be approximately 17% and our cash tax rate will be approximately 10 percentage points higher. The higher cash tax rate is largely due to the deferral of 2024 U.S. tax payments into 2025, that was provided under Hurricane Beryl disaster relief. As we always do during the fourth quarter call, we have provided additional 2025 modeling information in the appendix to the slide deck describing expected impacts from major planned maintenance and other useful financial metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim? Kim Foley : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13, with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $496 million. During the quarter, integrated polyethylene margins decreased as ethane and natural gas prices increased negatively impacting margins. Strong demand from export markets increased our polyethylene volumes. We operated our assets at approximately 80% of nameplate capacity in line with market demand. Our olefins crackers are in at approximately 98% of rates during the quarter. Our strong operational performance allowed us to capture additional spot sales in olefins markets, benefiting our results by approximately $40 million. During the first quarter, we expect higher ethane and natural gas costs due to winter energy demand with modest improvements in product volumes following seasonal weakness and ongoing strength in export markets. We expect to operate our O&P-Americas assets at an average rate of approximately 80% during the first quarter due to planned maintenance downtime at our Channelview olefin assets, as well as the impact of Winter Storm Enzo. Ahead of the storm, LYB proactively reduced rates and shut down some assets. We estimate that lost volumes from the storm-related downtime will impact first quarter EBITDA by approximately $45 million. In line with our commitment to both a profitable CLCS business, in November, we announced a second investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture with Agilyx and ExxonMobil reaching final investment decisions to build a second Cyclyx circularity center in Fort Worth, Texas. The facility will have the capacity to produce more than 130,000 tons per year of plastic feedstock for advanced and mechanical recycling, and is expected to start up in the second half of 2026. Now let's turn to Slide 14, and review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, European markets remained weak with higher feedstock cost and softer seasonal demand. Extended maintenance activities at our vesting site, along with additional unplanned downtime in France, reduced volumes and impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million during the fourth quarter. Due to this downtime, we operated our assets at rates of approximately 55%. The combined impact of weak demand and lower rates led to an EBITDA loss of $146 million. As we move into 2025, we expect improved European seasonal demand to drive higher volumes and margins. In contrast to 2024, our O&P EAI segment has no major turnaround scheduled for the coming year. Nevertheless, feedstock supply for one of our German crackers is currently constrained due to unplanned downtime at a nearby refinery. With those constraints and ongoing soft market demand, we expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 75% during the first quarter. Our team in Wesseling, Germany successfully completed our largest turnaround in the region during 2024. Our European strategic review continues, and we expect to be in a position to issue an update on the progress in the second half of this year. Our CLCS business continues to grow. In October, we acquired APK, allowing us to integrate its unique solvent-based low-density polyethylene recycling technology and to our comprehensive portfolio for building a profitable CLCS business. And construction is well underway for our first commercial catalytic chemical recycling plant, MoReTec-1 in Germany. Now let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss the results of the refining segment. During the fourth quarter, we incurred an EBITDA loss of $24 million. Margins remained relatively flat despite falling gasoline and diesel spreads due to improved utilization of our catalytic cracker. During the quarter, we operated the refinery at approximately 90% of capacity following unplanned downtime in the third quarter with an average crude rate of 244,000 barrels per day. Looking forward, refinery shutdown activities began following Winter Storm Enzo in January and are expected to be completed within the first quarter. While the storm caused a slight delay, we remain on track as we have already shut down the first train of crude and coker units with the second train, the cat cracker and auxiliary equipment to follow. In light of these activities, we expect final refinery utilization rates to be approximately 35% over the quarter. Our team remains highly focused on a safe and reliable shutdown as we wind down operations of our 107-year old refinery. Our number one priority has and always will be safety. I would like to take the opportunity to commend our team for an amazing job during this journey. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aaron. Aaron Ledet : Thank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 16, as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $250 million. Fourth quarter Oxyfuel margins were in line with typical winter lows, driven by lower prices for crude oil as well as lower gasoline crack spreads. We experienced modest volume improvement in our PO and derivatives business during the quarter despite weak demand for durable goods. Styrene margins remain under pressure given global supply and demand fundamentals, despite declining raw material prices. We operated our IND assets at a rate of approximately 70% during the fourth quarter to match low seasonal demand. The IND business achieved several strategic milestones in 2024, including the divestment of our non-core ethylene oxide and derivatives business and the operation of our newest PO/TBA asset at 78% rates for the year, surpassing our 2024 goal of 70%. With this steady progress, operating rates are expected to run at benchmark rates going forward. These significant milestones highlight the decisive actions we are taking to exit businesses where LYB does not have a path to market leadership, while growing and upgrading our core businesses and assets that are aligned with our long-term strategy. As we began the first quarter, we expect to see moderate demand improvements across most businesses as customers begin restocking after year-end inventory management. Additionally, we anticipate octane premiums will improve with the end of the winter and the favorable butane accrued ratios will continue to support long-term oxyfuels fundamentals. We plan to operate our assets at approximately 80% during the first quarter, inclusive of a small amount of unplanned downtime and lost volumes due to Winter Storm Enzo. With that, I will now turn the call over to Torkel. Torkel Rhenman : Thank you, Aaron. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 17. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $15 million, volumes were pressured by significantly lower fourth quarter demand from our automotive customers across all regions, slightly offset by favorable margins. Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter will reflect continued progress from our efforts to regain market share with our renewed focus on customer centricity. Our customer-centric approach helped drive approximately 20% EBITDA improvement during 2024 and an increase of 46% in our Net Promoter Score from customers versus the prior year. The team has made substantial progress in transforming our business with strategic customers by building back trust and increasing our win rate to gain new project qualifications. This progress helped us achieve above-market global volume growth for our sizable polypropylene compounds and Masterbatch businesses during 2024. In addition to our focus on transforming the business, I would like to congratulate the APS team for achieving record-setting safety performance in 2024, surpassing our prior record from 2023. I truly believe our progress in refilling our growth funnel and achieving superior safety results reflects our attention to detail and confirms we are on the right path to restoring and exceeding our historical performance. With that, I will return the call to Peter. Peter Vanacker : Thanks, Torkel. I would like to thank the entire LyondellBasell team for delivering such resilient results, and it's a very challenging macro environment. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 18 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, catalyst volumes moderated on typical seasonality while we achieved higher licensing revenue by reaching project milestones that resulted in segment EBITDA of $108 million. Through this progress, fourth quarter EBITDA exceeded the prior year by approximately 40%. First quarter results for the Technology segment are expected to decline to levels at or below the third quarter of 2024. While catalyst sales should improve with favorable seasonality, we expect moderating licensing revenue as project approvals for polyolefin capacity additions subside across the world. Please turn to Slide 19 as we discuss the near-term outlook by region and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect modest seasonal demand improvements across most businesses during the first quarter. In the Americas, we expect typical seasonal demand recovery will be met with tighter supply due to planned downtime across the industry from an unusually high level of spring cracker maintenance, including our Channelview turnarounds. In Europe, we expect rising energy costs will continue to pressure the European markets. Seasonal demand recovery and modest restocking of low inventories should provide some support. Moving forward, ongoing capacity rationalization appears likely, and should help improve market balance between supply and demand. In Asia, markets are showing slow but steady improvements in both volumes and margins. We are encouraged by China's targeted stimulus programs, but remain cautious while monitoring for signs that these efforts can translate into more meaningful market improvements. For the packaging sector, we expect to continue seeing steady global demand as we move ahead in the New Year. In Building & Construction, the U.S. infrastructure stimulus efforts are supporting increased industrial activity. Additionally, leading indicators for remodeling activity are predicting increased activity for the second and third quarters of 2025. In the automotive sector and modest recovery and seasonal demand could be pressured by elevated inventory levels across the industry. Additionally, we're watchful for changes in trade policies that could impact production as we move through the year. For oxyfuels, stronger crude prices and typical springtime improvements in gasoline crack spreads should provide benefits as we move through the quarter. Our focus remains on reliable operations and continuous optimization across our global footprint to capture market opportunities. And as Michael emphasized, we are maintaining our laser focus on cash generation. Now let me provide an overview of our outlook and how we are positioning LYB over the longer term in Slide 20. As we move into 2025, we're beginning to see signs of recovery in key end markets after two years of declines, domestic demand for U.S. polyolefins had a positive inflection in 2024. Reduced global interest rates, moderating inflation and pent-up demand, all provide a supportive backdrop for the inevitable recoveries in demand from durable goods, but we remain watchful of the potential impact that tariffs could have on affordability and global trade. Despite these uncertainties, LYB remains well positioned as the favorable oil to gas ratio continues to provide a cost advantage for our U.S. and Middle East production. Our portfolio transformation is well underway with strategic initiatives to strengthen and upgrade our core businesses. Recent milestones include the acquisition of NATPET, the divestment of our EO&D business, ongoing progress for our European strategic review and our exit from refining. During 2024, we have made excellent progress toward building our profitable C&LCS business by starting construction of our first MoReTec facility and bolstering our technology position with investments such as APK. Recent assessments by EcoVadis and Sustainalytics rate LYB in the top 10% for our industry. LYB is at the forefront of providing sustainable solutions for our customers. And our VEP is now on track to unlock at least $1 billion of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of this year. I am very proud of the progress our teams have made during 2024. And I'm confident that LYB is well positioned to achieve our strategic priorities while rewarding shareholders. Now with that, we're now pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. I was just curious, how much CapEx you expect to invest to reach that 2 million-ton level of circular plastics in the next five years. And presumably, that will be largely the CirculenRevive. But how do you get that margin uplift from that? You have a lot of confidence in it is that level of confidence sufficient to get some long-term contracts before you build the plan? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Steve. This is Peter. Very good question. We alluded to the fact, I mean, that we have around 20% of our total CapEx that is being invested in our C&LCS business. We remain, I mean, very confident because you have seen the very good growth that we have in the entire C&LCS portfolio in 2024. And we see the margins that they are in line with what we have said at the Capital Markets Day in March 2023. So remember, the incremental margin of $500 per ton, and it's incremental because that does not include the margin that is for example, in the cracker. Taking into consideration as well that our portfolio in 2024 did not yet include any substantial chemical recycling, so MoReTec technology products, as we are investing in the 50,000 ton capacity in Cologne, if you do the back of the end of calculation that would stand for, let's say, around \u20ac25 million to \u20ac30 million incremental EBITDA, starting up towards the end of 2026. And as I said in my prepared remarks as well, we are now very deeply engaged in the second investment, which is at double capacity, so 100,000 tons of MoReTec that we can be built at our refinery site in Houston. Not a final investment decision, but there is quite a lot of resources in the meantime that are busy with the engineering and the preparation to move them into a final investment decision. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Cunningham : Hi. Good morning. Peter, you painted the picture of material upside in margins just from getting back to normal mid-cycle levels. But I think there were some very abnormal things, which maybe benefited 10-year averages. Now sitting with plenty of supply overhang across a number of chains, sluggish demand. Does anything suggest this is the new normal? And if it is, can you be more aggressive with your strategy pivots? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Patrick. Very good question as well. I mean we showed this chart, I mean, to show, I mean, what the upside is as we are moving towards an environment that maybe will not happen in Q1, but that we believe, I mean, we'll continue to develop as we move towards the second half of 2025, in terms of higher demand. We see some uptick in demand, and you've seen the numbers. If you just look, for example, at the demands in North America for Polyethylene, while the year-on-year domestic demand improved by 4%. The overall demand improved by 8% in polyethylene, and that is because there was a very good cost position that continues to be a good cost position that the North American players have in order to be able to export more. So export grew by 12% year-on-year. But you've seen the same already. If we look at our propylene oxide and derivatives, even if everybody is saying, okay, durable goods, I mean we don't see a big uptick in demand. While we were able to grow our propylene oxide and derivatives business by 4% year-on-year 2024, so compared to 2023. So we see that there is this uptick possible. Another point I want to repeat, we have alluded to that also in previous earnings calls. There is not a huge amount of additional capacity that is coming on stream, cracker capacity, polyethylene and polypropylene capacity this year and also next year. And we are well positioned also on the other side, I mean, in oxyfuels and propylene oxide and derivatives because we have our new units, which is performing extremely well. Very pleased with that. So lowest cost, lowest carbon footprint, propylene oxides, are very well positioned also as we see continuous demand growth, I mean, for oxyfuels on a global basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Perrella : Hi. Good morning. It's Christopher Perrella on for Josh. With all the moving parts in the first quarter, is EBITDA growth positive in the first quarter with the turnarounds and kind of can you bracket sort of what your EBITDA expectations are near term? Peter Vanacker : Yes, let me answer that question, Christopher. Of course, I mean, what you always see normally in the first quarter, as you know, is that there is an uptick in demand. I mean that is seasonality. But of course, I also need to point out to the fact that the first quarter always starts with where the fourth quarter actually is ending. So we start at a low pound points, higher ethane costs, for example, feedstock costs, higher energy costs as we move into the first quarter. What will be, of course, very important for you to look at our first quarter is that we have a very large turnaround in Channelview. This is not a small one. You've seen, I mean, the financial impact that, that turnaround has. In addition to that, we anticipated where we took measures prior to the freeze Enzo hitting, let's say, Houston and surrounding. So we did proactively take measures. We did shut down a number of lines to minimize the impact of the freeze. So that will, of course, impact Q1 with slightly lower operating rates as a consequence in [indiscernible]. We have slightly higher rates than in I&D, slightly higher rates than also in Europe, Asia and international for O&P. Let me point out that North American demand, as I said before, in PE and PP, remains on the trajectory of recovery, so it remains, I mean strong. But as said before, I mean, Q1 starts where Q4 ended. So a slow start in the year, but we remain having quite a level of confidence as we move, I mean, towards 2025, we see, I mean, points in certain industries also regionally. That a huge amount of additional capacity asset. So we see points whereby, I mean, demand is starting slowly but steadily, we need to improve. Kim Foley : Peter, if I might, could I add a comment about the turnaround or turnarounds. I think is a better way to characterize it. So I want to help all of you with your modeling. We're taking down an olefins unit as well as our metathesis or Flex unit and all of our C4 processing. So the impact is not just the olefins, it's to propylene and C4 molecules when we talk in each of these calls about optimizing the cost of ethylene. So I wanted to make sure I highlighted that because last year we had a turnaround, and it was a $70 million impact. You see this time, it's $109 million. So I wanted to help everybody better understand what that is. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Lyondell has been characterized by dividend increases through the years. And EBITDA has been under pressure, but cash flows have been good. Has this gain of dividend increases for Lyondell come to an end? Or are dividends looking like they could increase in 2025? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Jeff. Good question as well, and then I'm going to start and maybe then also hand over to Michael. You heard me saying as well, and you heard Michael say as well in the prepared remarks. Fantastic cash flow generation throughout the year 2024, after a year 2023, where we did that as well. And I'm personally very pleased to meet with the attention that all our people have on cash flow generation. You see the results out of that. This is not just by coincidence. In addition to that, of course, we're doing that big transformation during 2025, which helps in having a very focused portfolio that is then also helping us to continue the trajectory as we have said at the Capital Markets Day on very good cash flow conversion. So if you look at all these factors, that's why we, Michael and I, we said in the prepared remarks. I mean, we're continuing to be very well positioned to continue the trajectory to increase our dividends. Of course, not a decision at this point in time, as you all know, that's a decision that is following in May, and that will be taken then by the Board. But if we look at the numbers, we continue to be quite confidence. Michael? Michael McMurray : Yes. I mean a couple of things else that I'd add, Peter, is, one, the balance sheet is in phenomenal shape. Maturity profile looks wonderful. And then we've been very disciplined and balanced from a capital allocation perspective. So we've been rewarding our shareholders with the dividend. We're also in the market buying back shares as everyone has seen. But we've also been very disciplined from a capital expenditure perspective. And for the benefit of investors, you'll recall that we said on average, we're going to spend about $2 billion over the period, 2023, 2024 and 2025. And actually, we've taken out about $750 million from those previous plans. So we are being very, very disciplined given kind of market conditions, but we're confident that we have the ability to responsibly grow our dividend in the future. Peter Vanacker : And that CapEx that we \u2013 the prioritization that we did very intensively during 2023 and 2024. And again, now for 2025 is really, I mean, a different view and how we are prioritizing our CapEx, diligent view on all the different projects. Taking into the consideration the portfolio change that we are making. So it's not a major impact that I expect that, that has \u2013 I mean, if you look at our growth for the big projects, like, for example, the MoReTec-2 project, like, for example, our next flexible metathesis and the Flex 2 units in Channelview. So it's not impacting those very important strategic growth projects. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Peter, you made a couple of comments about capacity, one, in Europe, suggesting that we might finally see some meaningful rationalization there. And I think also when you're talking about the technology segment, you talked about how you're seeing some future projects from customers get. I think you said canceled but maybe you only said deferred. But if you could just give us a little insight on what you're hearing and seeing and how meaningful either or both of those might be to the near or medium-term? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Vincent. Very good strategic questions. Capacity rationalization in Europe, as you know, is ongoing. There has been quite some announcements in the meantime out there. And I mean, from the market that these have not just been announcements, but actually capacities are being shut down. And it's not a coincidence because we all know, I mean, that there is quite some challenges in the European markets. Energy costs, just to point to that, is extremely high. Everybody is asking, I mean, for support from the regulators to keep the industry in Europe. But in the meantime, it takes time until these decisions are being taken by the authorities, and the entire industry is taking action. The list is getting longer and longer on rationalizations in Europe. You know that we have been very early in that entire process with our European strategic assessments. We continue to make very good process \u2013 progress on the strategic assessment. Nothing that we can announce at this point in time, but rest assured, we're making very good progress in that regard. Now you see the other side, and that gives us always a good hedging and a good visibility because in our technology segment, we do see that there is a slowdown in demand for licenses. And that fits very well together with what we have been saying that there is a slowdown in additional capacities that will be built up during the next years, five years as long as we can look forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Hey. Good morning. And best wishes again, Michael, and congrats again Agustin. Michael McMurray : Thank you, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Yes. Peter, you offered that we're starting out 1Q at a low level, mentioning energy prices, ethane prices, et cetera. Obviously, there's a lot of price increases that are on the table. I'm speaking specifically on polyethylene and just O&P Americas in general. So we have some price increases on the table, but we also have some contract resets. How do you view the margin profile for polyethylene playing out as we move through the first quarter? Peter Vanacker : Thank you, Frank. And of course, also, thank you, I mean, for sending best wishes, I mean to Michael, and I'm absolutely confident that Agustin is going to be the very good successor of Michael, having worked now with Agustin since a number of years. So to your question, if you look at all the data points, no major capacity increases in North America that are hitting the market. The surprise that we had in Q4 that prices didn't go up for polyethylene but actually went down despite the fact that the quarter was very balanced with quite a lot of exports outside of the United States. I mean, these price increases that are out there for both, I mean, PE as well as for PP. So let me hand over now \u2013 I mean to our Head of the business units to Kim. Kim, how confident are you? Kim Foley : So I want to build a little bit on this story before I talk about confidence and price increases. In January and December, as we've alluded to, you saw these higher feedstock and energy costs that translate to about a $0.05 or $0.06 per pound increase in ethylene. So we're coming into this market with lower starting polymer prices as well as, as you've said, Frank, contract resets. So LYB and other producers have announced 7 and 5. Do I have a crystal ball and can say that well, what's the probability of that? No. But what I want to remind you to help you understand this full picture is 5% of the industry crackers are coming offline. That's a lot of capacity. So if I'm an integrated producer and I've got an olefins outage, am I going to buy expensive ethylene to have a negative margin and produce polyethylene? I don't think so. So I think it's really important that everybody understands the full gist of the \u2013 and the importance of we've got to have margin throughout the chain. So don't have a crystal ball, but I'm pretty confident that we're going to see some margin \u2013 or some price improvement in the first quarter. Peter Vanacker : And you had some impacts of Enzo as well. Kim Foley : Yes. Peter Vanacker : Very good. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you. And good morning everyone. My compliments on Slide number 5, which I think is interesting to kind of compare and contrast a degree of depression across some of these markets. Peter, I'd appreciate your updated cycle view on the propylene chain or polypropylene. It seems to me, on the one hand, these cracker closures should also serve to diminish supply of propylene monomer. On the other hand, I think you have a lot of these crude oil to chemical projects around the world, particularly longer term that are meant to maximize propylene coming out of refineries and so forth. So how do you view maybe the next two or three years in that chain? And might you plan to take strategic action there yourselves? Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you very much. I mean, Kevin, let me hand over, I mean to Kim on that question. Kim Foley : So Kevin, I think as you've seen the industry go to lighter feedstocks, more ethane versus naphtha, you've seen a decline in propylene. A lot of people have as such, have built PDH units were converting propane to propylene. And you see a lot of that capacity has been in China. So you're seeing China set the floor here for propylene to polypropylene dynamics. LyondellBasell, for us, being an integrated propylene producer, it's important for us not only on polypropylene, but on propylene oxide. So we've announced that we are an FID for what we call our Flex 2 or metathesis unit. And we are taking back control of the propylene molecules for us not only as we shut down our refinery and lose our refinery grade propylene, but also as we think about how to have better integration through our chains. Peter Vanacker : I want to add to that, of course, that we continue to be very engaged in Saudi Arabia with our joint venture that we have built up called NATPET. So we have, I mean, then, of course, have capacity in polypropylene, which is the lowest delivered cost capacity, where we got feedstock conditions, and we continue to work with our partner on the expansion project to more than double that capacity. The other part, I mean, on strategic measures is falling in the European assessment. Remember, before we started with the European assessment, we took out capacity in the southern part of Italy. And assets, we are still working on the European assessment. We are in the market, making good progress on that as well. So you'll see that shift strategically, with all these elements, the ones as Kevin alluded to, the ones that I mentioned, to have \u2013 to be very well positioned to grow on one hand side, but grow also with a much lower cost coming position. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. Peter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you again, I mean, for all the excellent questions. I also want to again thank our global team for delivering outstanding value and maximizing cash conversion during these challenging times, while operating safely and reliably. Now I would like to leave you with four key messages. First of all, we continue to make excellent progress on our strategy to make LYB a much more focused company with a leading streamlined and advantaged asset footprint and product offering. Secondly, we're best positioned to navigate this long down cycle, and we see early signs of improvements. Third, our cash conversion and dividend yield continues to be leading in our industry, and we are well positioned to extend our track record of growing our dividends in 2025. And fourth, we're progressing well with the execution of our company transformation to grow our asset portfolio of cost-advantaged operations from 60% to 70%, and we have started work to simplify our operating model as a consequence than out of that. So with that, we wish you all a great and safe weekend. Stay well. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
