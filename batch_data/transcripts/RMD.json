Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maisha. I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin. Constance C. Bienfait: Thank you, Maisha, and thank you, all, for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you can access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. [Operator Instructions] Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO; and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team here present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, go ahead. Michael J. Farrell: Great. Thanks, Connie, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll review the highlights of our fiscal Q1, and then hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail. So first, the financial summary. Global revenue in Q1 of fiscal 2014 grew 5% year-on-year, to $358 million, that's up 4% on a constant-currency basis. Americas revenue grew 4% to $202 million. Europe, Asia and the rest of the world headline revenue increased 7% for the quarter, which is 5% growth in constant currency terms. We believe the overall global growth of the industry remained steady at 6% to 8%, with global flow generator growth in the 4% to 6% range and global Mask category growth at approximately 8% to 10%. Net income for the quarter increased 14% to $81 million, while earnings per share increased 14% to $0.56 for the quarter. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from the team. I'm going to start with an overview on Europe, where we saw a strong regional growth, with solid performance in many countries, including France -- particularly France, the U.K., as well as Switzerland. Both our German homecare business and our German dealer business also grew strongly. The European results were driven by strength in both flow generators and Masks. One of the main drivers of flow generator growth in Europe was the AutoSet CS product. This product includes the proprietary PaceWave algorithm that is designed for congestive heart failure patients with cardiorespiratory disorders, including Cheyne-Stokes respiration, amongst others. We also saw strong growth in our Respiratory Care products throughout Europe, including continued adoption of our Stellar ventilation platform. Mask growth was also solid across the European region, with both the Quattro Air and the Swift FX Nano masks being well received across the region. In France, the government confirmed during the quarter that its telemonitoring requirements would take effect right at the start of this quarter, on October 1. We believe that this announcement during the quarter dispelled any confusion in the homecare provider space in France, and will help ResMed grow its share in both the flow generator and the emerging healthcare informatics space in France, as well as across Europe. We are starting to see success in the way we position EasyCare Online solutions for monitoring requirements, not only in France, but also in other parts of Europe. Building on the strength in the U.S., this is becoming a global trend. We expect that success to continue. We announced on our website today that we have acquired an Eastern European-based distributor of sleep-disordered breathing, as well as respiratory care products. The acquisition is in Poland, the country with a population of around 40 million, and a gross domestic product of around USD 490 billion. This acquisition strengthens our presence in Eastern Europe, allowing us to expand ResMed's reach to help more patients with access to comfortable and effective treatment for respiratory disorders and also, to be able to more closely support the local homecare provider networks in developing respiratory care, as well as cardiorespiratory markets. This acquisition is an element of our ongoing global emerging market growth strategy. In the Asia Pacific region, sales were lumpy, influenced by our business primarily in Japan. The long-term opportunities in this region remain incredibly strong, especially in our emerging markets -- growth opportunities in this region, with a focus particularly on China, as well as India. In the Americas, we saw steady 5% flow generator growth, knowing that we were up against a very tough prior year comparison. Flow generators were up 17% in Q1 fiscal 2013, and we hit 5% in Q1 2014. This 5% increase is in line with market growth, which we said is around 4% to 6%. We are holding share in this category. The strong mix shift from CPAP to APAP was evident again as the trend to home sleep testing continues to drive this mix shift. The S9 AutoSet remains our flagship product in this region, and it is growing well. We're seeing a trend that new patient growth is very solid in the U.S. And we attribute some of the growth that is part of that trend to the increased availability of home sleep testing. We estimate that approximately 35% of all U.S. sleep diagnostic tests are now with HST. This is driven primarily by payer mandates. We also think that HST will grow in the next 12 months to around 40% to 45% of all tests done within the U.S. Additionally, we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST. We think it's around 55%, based on our latest sleep lab survey data, but sleep labs are really engaging in HST and looking to offer it as a choice to patients. And we're partnering with our sleep labs to help provide our ApneaLink services, our VPAP Tx services and other services that can help them diagnose patients. In terms of Respiratory Care devices in the Americas, we are seeing positive early trends with our VPAP ST-A and our VPAP COPD products. You'll remember VPAP COPD was just recently launched. Both of these are now on the S9 platform. These products have a long lead sales cycle, and we expect this growth to continue over the coming quarters and beyond. We are taking share in the respiratory care space, and these products are positive margin contributors. We believe regulatory approval of the Stellar product in Brazil is imminent, and we expect that this will be a great geographic market for growth, given its particular homecare ventilation needs in that geography. We are making good progress on our Respiratory Care pipeline, and we plan to launch a new Respiratory Care platform for patients in fiscal year 2014. Masks in the Americas were up against a tough year-on-year comparison. Masks, if you remember, grew 13% year-on-year in Q1 fiscal 2013. We acknowledge that we lost share in this quarter due to a competitive product cycle, particularly in the nasal category and, to a lesser extent, in the pillows category. We held share in the full face category, helped by initial momentum from the launch of Quattro Air. It was released late in the fourth quarter. As I stated in our press release, the Quattro Air is on its way to being one of our best mask product launches ever. And there's lots of runway left for that product. We're only 90 days in. We also launched the Swift FX Nano in the U.S. during September, which is just a couple of weeks ago, the last month, obviously, of the quarter. The Nano has a low-profile nasal cushion, minimal headgear, and we expect the Nano to help get us back on the front foot in the nasal category. We have had a leading position in the masks space for many years and we will maintain that. We obviously expect competition in this space, and we expect customers to sample new competitive products. The increasing competition, in fact, in the nasal and pillow categories demonstrates that the market continues to look for, and reward, new product innovation, despite the ongoing reimbursement pressures. We think that's good for our business because innovation is our strong suit. We have an incredibly exciting pipeline of innovative new masks across all the categories coming out over the next 3, 6, 9 months and beyond, with one mask launch, literally, just around the corner. There's been a round of competitive bidding launched on July 1, the first day of the quarter that we're talking through here, Q1. And that caused some distraction, as we've talked about, for our U.S. channel in the quarter. Our HME customers had new reimbursement rates that were announced in February but went into effect on July 1. Remember, CB 2 is a significant part of Medicare, which is around 25% of the HME payer portfolio in the U.S. market. HMEs who won new CB 2, or competitive bidding 2 -- I'll use CB 2 as an abbreviation in this call, contracts in geographies where they didn't have a brick-and-mortar presence now have to set up subcontracts. HMEs who won CB 2 in areas where they have an established presence now have to collect paperwork on the new Medicare patients and establish replenishment programs for those new patients. HMEs who lost contracts in CB 2 are now working on driving new referrals for commercial payers, which is the other 75% of their payer portfolio, and on subcontracting partnerships for the 25%, that is CB 2. It looks to us that CB 2 has temporarily impacted volumes in the U.S. market, but as that distraction clears, volumes will pick up to meet the ongoing growth in patient demand. As I said earlier, we have seen new patient growth that is solid, and the underlying fundamental patient dynamic of home sleep testing is driving that. And the fact that 85% of this most penetrated of our markets, which is the U.S., 85% of the patients still need to be diagnosed and treated. That's a lot of runway ahead of us. We continue to see the trends that sleep-disordered breathing and COPD prevalence, awareness and patient referrals are all growing. It's notable that in the Round One Recompete bid that was announced during Q1, the reimbursement rates for sleep and respiratory care products increased versus CB 2. We believe this is a very good indicator. With CB 2 rates and contracts now in effect, and have been in effect for over 90 days, we're encouraged that uncertainty is receding and customers are focusing on how to succeed in this new environment. We're partnering with our HME customers and helping them take cost out of our mutual supply chain and out of the system. Our solutions include EasyCare Online, U-Sleep, electronic data interchange, replenishment optimization, drop ship programs, PCP awareness, and patient engagement programs and more in the healthcare informatics space. As a particular example in the healthcare informatics management space, we announced an alliance at Medtrade during the quarter with Brightree. Brightree is a cloud-based software development company. The ResMed online store will now be integrated with Brightree's HME management solutions, simplifying the ordering process for our mutual HME customers. So HME customers who use Brightree's systems will be able to order ResMed products with a single login and access to inventory availability data directly in their own management systems. This makes it easier to do business with ResMed and it makes it more cost efficient to do business with ResMed. Brightree's share of the healthcare informatics space is somewhere in the 30% to 40% range, we believe, in the HME management solutions based in the U.S. As an example of patient engagement programs, we just crossed over the 1-year anniversary mark for our Wake Up to Sleep offering. Wake Up to Sleep is ResMed's comprehensive sleep apnea support community. It's intended to help people along their entire sleep-disordered breathing journey from awareness, to diagnosis, to treatment, to ongoing adherence. There are already multiple tens of thousands of people signed up for the program, which focuses on the lifelong value to the patient. Once engaged, Wake Up to Sleep helps patients through their journey, and helps them maximize adherence. This benefits the patient, but it also benefits the physician, the HME provider and the payer. Finally, on the intellectual property front, we were just designated by an independent IP firm, Intellectual Asset Management, as the leading global company in the Asia Pacific region with, in their words, \"world-class IP functions and strategies and strong IP protection.\" So ResMed is seen by them as a truly global IP player committed to asserting its IP rights. We've demonstrated this by defending and protecting our intellectual property and our solid R&D investments over the years, with lawsuits against both APEX and BMC. Let me wrap up with this. Our respiratory medical market is no longer just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing. It's about forming partnerships with our customers and offering full-service solutions for patients, providers, physicians and payers to help manage outcomes of chronic disease. This solutions approach applies in our core market of sleep-disordered breathing, but it also applies in our growing Respiratory Care business, as well as in our fast-growing cardiorespiratory business. For these 3 horizons of growth, the combination of our world-leading quality flow generators, as well as the most comfortable and effective patient interface systems on the planet, as well as easy-to-access, robust and actionable software solutions, makes ResMed the leading value proposition for our customers. We have a robust pipeline of new products in both devices, as well as in masks, as well as in future business process innovations that are planned for sleep, Respiratory Care and cardiology. We are laser-focused on bringing these innovative solutions to our market, and we're managing the fundamentals of our business. Those fundamentals are that we continue to improve patients' quality of life, we continue to prevent disease progression, and we continue to reduce the burden of health care costs for critical, chronic diseases, such as sleep-disordered breathing, COPD and heart failure. Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. Brett? Brett A. Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the September quarter were $357.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 4%. Income from operations for the quarter was $96.9 million, an increase of 20% over the prior-year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $80.9 million, an increase of 14% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56 for the quarter, again, an increase of 14% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 63.7%, an increase of 230 basis points compared to Q1 FY '13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from favorable currency movements, favorable product mix and manufacturing improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%, assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $101.3 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 28.3%, compared to the year-ago figure of 28.9%. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of $0.28 for fiscal year 2014. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.4 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. While in constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 9%. R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 7.7% compared to the year-ago figure of 8%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline, tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, as the majority of our research and development is undertaken in Australia. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.4 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.8 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, compared to the prior-year quarter effective tax rate of 21.6%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rates associated with our Singapore manufacturing operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $201.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $156.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $88.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting solid growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $112.9 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting a very competitive market, particularly in the nasal and pillow segments. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $103.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 4%. Masks and other sales were $53 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 4%, while Masks and other also increased by 4%. Cash flow from operations was $90.4 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $17.9 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 432,000 shares for consideration of $21.1 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 4.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. We plan to repurchase at least 2 million shares during fiscal year 2014. In addition to the buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter was $616 million, and at September 30, total assets stood at $2.3 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion. I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Could I, perhaps, just dig in a little bit to the U.S. flow generators, of course, and just ask you to clarify your comments or elaborate on your comments around volume and price? You mentioned it being weaker sort of in volumes or disruption, I think, through the bidding process? Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Andrew, so there was some temporary distraction that we talked about from the CB 2 rates that we saw in Q1. The Americas' flow generators growth was 5% year-on-year, which is in the middle of that 4% to 6% range that we think is around that. So reasonably solid growth from us, but in looking at our partners, our HME's business and working with them, we noticed some distraction in, as we said, the contracts from the winners, the subcontracting from the nonwinners and the relationships that have to happen in terms of getting both prescriptions and referrals for patients who were on the replenishment programs for -- who transferred from nonwinners to winners. So all that together caused some temporary distraction during the quarter, and we think that's had some effect on the flow generator growth of the market. And we did reasonably well, I think, in terms of holding our share in a pretty tough quarter for that, where we hit 5%. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And just when we look at that 5%, can you elaborate any further on mix, on what was price versus volume? Because you have spoken to the impact of price on the group before? Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So I mean, as we talked about on our last call in the intervening period, around 5% to 7% is the sort of year-on-year price reductions that we've seen. If you remember, last call, we talked about 4% to 6%. So that's a delta of 100 basis points. We think that is temporary and associated with the distraction that happened particularly in the U.S. market. And that 5% to 7% can possibly go back to the 4% to 6%. And we think that will happen as the distraction clears. So without, Andrew, breaking out the specifics of exactly what unit volumes are, which we never do here, and we just talk about revenue growth, that 5% number has sort of all those factors weighed into it. Operator : Our next question is Ben Andrew with William Blair. Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : The question I guess, for me, first off, is talk a little bit about the revenue that you might be getting from ventilators and ventilatory kind of masks in the quarter in the United States? And kind of break that out, if you can, to give us a kind of raw sleep number, if that's relevant. And then second, just on the currency side, for Brett, if rates hold steady, what do you expect for the quarter and the year? Michael J. Farrell: So I'll take the first part and Brett will take the second. But it will be a quick answer, Ben, we're not going to break out Respiratory Care versus sleep. We're just going to keep flow gens versus masks. Brett, do you want to take the second part? Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, I do. I mean, the currency impact obviously benefited on the gross margin with the currency this quarter. And if I look -- if you look through from Q1 into Q2, I still think we'll see some favorable benefits there, and I'd estimate probably -- it's probably going to be in the order of 70 basis points, if currencies hold. Go in [ph] with caution, as all these crept up a bit over the quarter. If you looked in -- for the gain in the Q2, Q3, then you'd see something like half of that 70 basis points reversing back into -- in Q3. So we're going a long way out in terms of predicting on currencies. But if you think about it, Q2 will still see some favorable benefits from currency, then if you watch into Q3, that'd probably, on a sequential basis, reverse a little bit. But looking -- kind of underlying theme of favorability from currency movement, I think we're still going to see that play out on the bottom line in the next few quarters. Operator : Our next question is David Low with Deutsche Bank. David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just touching on masks. I mean, mask resupply and the growth in the number of masks per patient has been a big trend in recent years. I was wondering if you could, one, comment on that; and two, just comment on whether you're seeing much brand change or seen patients changed the mask model they use once they already establish the user of CPAP? Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, David. The mask resupply has been, and will continue to be, a strong element of growth long-term for the industry. We partnered very closely, particularly in the U.S. market, with our customers to help drive replenishment programs, really, over the last 3, 5 years, and even beyond that in terms of helping them access their patients, understand adherence rates, understand the importance of that for keeping the patients out of hospital, saving money for the health care system. And that is good for the patient, it's good for the payer and it's good for the provider. So there's a good incentive for all the parties involved. And we've seen that grow really well, as you have, over the quarters. We think that trend will absolutely continue and we will be a part of it. Clearly, in Q1, we did not grow as fast as we'd like to in the nasal and -- particularly, the nasal category but also somewhat in the pillows category. With the launch of the Swift FX Nano, we're back on the front foot in the nasal category. And that's got an S-curve to go up. But as I said in my opening remarks, we have 3 great masks coming out across the categories over the next 3, 6, 9 months. And we believe that those will get us on the front foot for the new patient setup. On the second part of your question about switching patients, masks tend to be like those really comfortable pair of jeans or those really comfortable pair of shoes where it's hard to get someone to change. And if they change, they often buy the same pair of jeans or the same pair of shoes that they were wearing before. And it's difficult to get patients to switch. We think that fundamental is still there. And that's why it's all the more important for us to get these great new masks out and get back on the front foot for new patient setup because there's a trailing revenue opportunity and a trailing opportunity to really help the health care system by keeping those patients with masks for their lifetime. Operator : Our next question is Saul Hadassin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Mick, just a question on -- you mentioned the temporary disruption that you've seen post company, can you talk to how long you think that disruption's likely to last? Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Saul. Yes, it's a temporary distraction in the U.S. market associated with CB2, right? So the U.S. market, which is 50% of the global, it's within that 25% that's [indiscernible] as Medicare. That temporary distraction -- how long is a piece of string? We don't have 100% knowledge on how long it'll take, but we believe it's a matter of months. It's not a matter of weeks. But it's not a matter of quarters. This is a matter of months and we think the U.S. customers have been dealing with this for, now, 90 -- across 20, we're talking about 110, 114 days now. It's not new to them, we've been partnering with them over this period. They know what the challenges are and they're working hard at getting all the paperwork sorted out, getting the subcontracts sorted out, getting the new prescriptions, getting the patients on their databases and working with them. And we are partnering with them -- as we said, with things like the Brightree to make it single order entry, single approach to 1 health care infomatic system to be able to order and resupply. So we think that, over the next number of months, we'll be able to help them through that process, and we're pretty confident in that. Jim, I don't know if you want to add a couple of comments, Jim Hollingshead, who is our President of the Americas, might add a couple of comments. He's closer to this. James Hollingshead : Sure. I mean, to give you guys a sense of the scale of it, roughly half of competitive bid to contracts were won by HMEs who did not have physical facilities in the place where they wanted, right? And so as Mick referred to in the opening comments, that means that there's a lot of subcontracting arrangements that have to be worked out. And so if you just think that side of it alone -- just think of the contracts that had to be set up -- and the subcontracting model is actually new, for the most part, in the HME world. So there's a big administrative burden. Once you've figured out a model, you've got a lot of paperwork you've got to do and you've got arrangements, you have to set up around who owns the inventory and how does it get shipped and things like that. It creates an extra burden on top of, and parallel to, the reimbursement cuts. And so, how long will it take to work through? We see people working through it already. Our customers are very good business people. They have historically shown real resilience in dealing with administrative burden created by both government payers and, well, by Medicare and private payers. So we think we seen working through it now and we think it's probably months and not weeks, but it's not an all year thing. We think they'll clear it and we think they're working through it right now. Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Again, just a follow-up question for Brett. Just wanted to ask where you are in terms of manufacturing production out of Singapore and where you think that might get to over the next 12 months or so? Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, we're around the 60% mark. We're a little bit more on the Flow Gens, a little bit less on the Mask, but you can sort of blend it around the 60%, And I think, as we said before, I think we just progressively kind of lift that as our production increases. So, also, we predict exactly where we'll be, but that will certainly become a larger percentage of our manufacturing over time. Operator : Our next question is Steve Wheen with JPMorgan. Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just on your rest-of-world numbers and Asia Pacific you referred to as being lumpy. Could you sort of give it a little bit more color as to what's happening there, and in particular, your reference to Japan? What is going on in that market? Michael J. Farrell: Yes, thanks for the questions, Steve. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer. Robert Douglas : The Japan market has always been lumpy for us. Probably you're aware we've got just a few large customers there that run very significant home care businesses, and they replenish their fleet periodically. Tracking the underlying patient numbers and the whole progression of the sleep business there is progressing well. But order, timing and that just meant that we were in a low part of the lumpy run in Japan. We're very confident of the business there. We've got great relationships with our customers and our teams are working well together in serving those markets. That was really the main issue. The other smaller markets in Asia-Pac all did pretty well and we saw good growth through the emerging markets in there, but they're not yet material enough to show up on these numbers. Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then just also on France, the formalization of that, I guess, compliance regime. What sort of response are you seeing from the buyers in that market? Michael J. Farrell: Okay, Steve. So we're 110 days in, and we think it's months away on CB2 lineup. We're 23 days in to the French announcement of the telemonitoring, and so 3 weeks -- Anne Reiser, who's our President of Europe, is all across this. She's actually our previous President of France, and ran that business since we hired her from Medtronic for almost a decade in sales and laying it [ph], so she knows the French market intimately. And we have good relations with both the authority and excellent relationships with our customers in France. And we have seen this coming and have been planning for it. We have had great learning from our U.S. market, with EasyCare Online now becoming the leader in healthcare informatics for the sleep disorder breathing space, and we have been able to scale that business very well over the last number of years in the U.S. So we have the systems, the tools and the scalable capabilities that we have now taken, literally, to within the country of France and availability now across the European Union. So it's early days. We think the customers are starting to get to grips around it and understanding how to work with us. We think it's going to be a benefit for the S9 order set, for the S9 order set with wireless capabilities and for our EasyCare Online solution in France. But, Steve, it's too early days to say how quickly that S-curve will start to happen, but the starting gun just went off. Operator : Our next question is Matthew Prior with Bank of America. Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Mick, just a question, just peeling back the layers on CB a little bit further, the 100 basis points of discounting or price pressure that you saw since the last update. Can you give us a sense as to whether that was pressure from private insurers or payers? Or is that driven more from a competitive element, given that volumes are depressed from the distraction factor and various manufacturers fighting for volume? Michael J. Farrell: Matthew, we don't have visibility into the exact per-customer, per-payer knowledge of our customers and so what we do is look at it as a portfolio. Clearly, globally, we saw 100 basis points with the 5% to 7% year-on-year price declines. So there's some impact there, but breaking it out between public and private is very high. What we know are the facts. The facts are that CB2 was announced in February, and went into play in July 1, and that's the main impact that's happened across that payer portfolio. There have been very minor changes in private payers that are not out of the ordinary in and what was happening over the last, not just 5 quarters, but 5 years. So I'm affected by CB or CB1 or CB2. So I'd say that you could deduce that, primarily, price changes were driven by CB2, but we don't have true visibility into it. So it's an assumption, but a pretty good one, based upon the data that we have in hand. Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And just a follow-up question, I guess, for them all. Have you seen any change in competitive behavior, to the extent that, again, lower volumes from the distraction factor? Are all various manufacturers still behaving in the same manner which they've behaved, and that it gets around 1 in previous near quarters, given this backdrop of low-volume growth? Michael J. Farrell: Yes, look, I think the pricing behavior has been pretty steady in that 5% to 7% range. I mean, clearly, the new product introduction behavior is that there have been a number of new products introduced by, primarily, our 2 major competitors. Without going into detail, we talked about the nasal category and the pillows category being where they are looking to enter and the customers are sampling those products. We're very confident that not only the Quattro Air's success but Swift FX Nano's great start. And without going into detail, the pipeline that we have coming in the next 3, 6 to 9 months will get us back on the front foot for that first-time setup. So if I was to summarize competitive behavior, I'd say it's about innovation and it's about competition through small, acquired and more comfortable, and better for the patient. Because everyone is starting to realize that adherence is the outcome that matters. That's what saves money for the payer, it's what saves money for the employer and it's what benefits the patient directly each night. That level of competitive behavior of innovating on value, is something that we think is healthy for the industry, but we also think plays to our strong suit over the last couple of decades, and something that we are absolutely confident we can get back on the front foot. Operator : Our next question is Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Can we spend a moment on gross margins? Which were pretty spectacular this quarter. How sustainable is that? And what drove almost 100 basis point uptick sequentially? Michael J. Farrell: Brett? Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. I mean, the big one, sequentially, would have been FX impact. So, sequentially, that contributed around 90 basis points. So you think on that, that's basically most of that expansion, if you like. I mean, but if you're still looking at trend buys, we're still getting product mix benefits and things like CPAP to APAP, the Respiratory Care business, all those provide, if you like, sort of a bit of tailwind for us on the gross margin. And some geographic mix, there's some benefit around geographic mix this time around, which -- generally, we probably don't get to the same magnitude we got this time. So there's a few things playing out. The other one is on -- I mean, we're working really hard in the manufacturing and the cost outside of the business as well. And you're seeing that sort of manifest pretty consistently now through the gross margin, and we're absolutely committed to those programs. So, again, you'll see them flowing through as well. And what we're looking to do is -- and you've probably seen it here in the last year or 2 is really do enough through the product mix, through manufacturing logistics to offset the ASP decline. Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, now I know you don't like to give revenue guidance, but given all of the pushes and takes that are happening in the first quarter, and quite frankly, the constant currency growth rate which is a meaningful step down from where you have been, can you comment on what you think your revenue may grow at, even if it's a range, for 2014? Michael J. Farrell: No, Joanne, we don't give guidance on revenue. I'll reiterate our market guidance, that we believe that the global market will grow at 6% to 8%, Flow Generators will grow at 4% to 6%, and Masks will grow at 8% to 10%. Operator : Next question is David Clair with Piper Jaffray. David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : I guess, just kind of a bigger picture one for me, but how do you defend your market share from lower-cost manufacturers and kind of the post-competitive bidding environment? At Medtrade that seems like a lot of kind of fringe players who are talking about this as an opportunity to take some share. Michael J. Farrell: David, low-cost competition is nothing new in our industry. It's been around for over a decade. Many of the players at Medtrade are players who have been trying to enter this market and/or other markets. When I say this market, the one you're at, at Medtrade, the U.S. market and/or other markets around the world, for many years. And the way I'd look at it is if supply was unable to enter the Chinese market or the Brazilian market and their levels of focus on quality and cost trade-off, what are their chances in the U.S. market? So I think it comes back to the fundamentals. The fundamentals here are that health care systems are growing at a fast rate, relative to GDP, for every major developed country. And the U.S. is at 18% of its GDP on health care. Most of western Europe is somewhere in the 10% to 12% of its GDP on health care. Every healthcare system around the world is looking for outcomes and value, and that's driven by long-term adherence and reduction of cost with improvement of quality of life of the patient. We have focused very closely on this, and every new product we bring to market, every new solution we bring to market, looks to take cost out of the system and improve adherence rates for the patient, and reduce the long-term costs for payers and for employers. So, in that environment, with all that going on, I don't think a low-cost solution that has low value has a great opportunity to get into the market. We have great value, our products, at good value prices. So this is happening on a global scale. But I guess you were in the U.S. at Medtrade, maybe I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead to give some detail on what's happening in the U.S. market with those new entrants. James Hollingshead : Well, the first thing -- I think it's a great question and I completely agree with Mick's answer. But if I just think, with our customers, right? The basic equation for our customers is they need products to work. So they need to be able to easily set up a patient. They need to be able to track the compliance of that patient, make sure the patient gets compliance and then create a resupply model. And so the better the product works, the better off they are. And our products work better than other products on the market. We have the best products on the market. Most of the low-cost sort of Asian entrants are producing products that really are not in that class. They don't work that well. They create cost at setup, they create lower compliance rates, et cetera. It's not a very good value proposition. Having said that, we're very mindful. I mean, we're watching the competitive set. And the key thing for us, over time, is to be able to continue to innovate with great product, which we have a great track record of doing, right? So that's it. Now, one of the things we found, and I was actually going to suggest we might turn to Dave to comment is the other issue was around our intellectual property. So, in this space, intellectual property is very strong. And as you guys know, we've defended our intellectual property against a couple of Asian entrants. And that's another way we defend. But I think that the basic way we defend is we have the great products that work that create more revenue for our customers. Michael J. Farrell: Yes, it's a good suggestion. Dave, you want to address the IP side and also to APEX and BMC deal? David Pendarvis : Sure. So the key here is, when people come in to compete and they compete with using our intellectual property, we're not going to let it happen. So, whether that's a small competitor or whether it's a large competitor, we intend to enforce our intellectual property. And that's a different question from a small competitor who comes in and tries to compete using their own R&D, which obviously they've got to get off their own merit. But we're not going to hesitate to continue to enforce our intellectual property against market entrants who want to use the innovation of our hard working employees. And that's something we're continuing to fight with APEX and BMC on. We expect to continue to win those battles. And then at the same time, we expect to be able to be prepared to launch them if we need to. We prefer to see competitors respect our intellectual property and battle on the field. But if we need to battle in court, we won't hesitate to do that. David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : And then in terms of the temporary distraction that you guys saw during the quarter, how would you -- would you kind of say that things started out badly in early July and it kind of got progressively better as the quarter rolled on or was it just kind of depressed throughout the quarter? Michael J. Farrell: David, we have daily conversations with our customers. It's hard to get a read on this at that level of detail, but what I can say is the temporary distraction is receding, and it's a question on how fast it recedes. We're 111, 114 days in. It's better than 100 days in, it's better than 90 days in. And it's going in the right direction and we believe it will resolve over a matter of months. The exact kinetics of it, during the quarter, is something that we just don't have visibility to. But the needle is moving in the right direction. Operator : Our next question is Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just wondering, in bilevels, whether you can talk to some of the initiatives you're doing to perhaps broaden the channel and the class of patients that use those products. Michael J. Farrell: Yes, absolutely. And we are very focused on our VPAP ST-A, our VPAP COPD and across our pipeline in the COPD space. So that's the first market that we have huge opportunities for our bilevels. The VPAP COPD product was just launched in the end of Q4. So it's initial part of its S-curve. It involves some interaction through the pathway, with the sleep lab, where we have excellent channel access and channel control. And we have our VPAP Tx titration devices available in sleep labs across the country, and so we're really excited about the opportunities in COPD. Secondly, in the bilevel side, long-term, there's a huge opportunity in heart failure. And as you saw, we talked about our European growth being very strong during the quarter. That is helped by the fact that we are running SERVE-HF in France, Germany, the Nordics, as well as the U.K., as well as sites outside Europe. But we're seeing a halo effect from that trial, in the cardiorespiratory space. So, the order set CS product, which is an adaptive servo-ventilation product, an extension of those bilevels, saw some incredible growth. Not just during Q1, but over the last number of quarters. That is a long S-curve, and as we get to the end of results from SERVE-HF, which is mid-2015, there could be an inflection point in really accelerating those cardiorespiratory sales. So I'd summarize, Ian, by saying we've got great initial movement on our S9 bilevels, but there's a heck of a lot of runway ahead for us, particularly in the cardiorespiratory space. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : For my second question, can we -- just changing topics to DMEs. Just wondering, if you look at your U.S. business and breaking the DMEs into some of the large nationals, and then obviously you've got the regionals and then some of the smaller single-person operator. If you look at, say, your business last year and then projecting your business -- maybe not this year, but maybe another year out -- to what extent do you see the percentage of your business changing across those sort of various classes of DMEs, is it going to be material or is it going to be relatively gradual? Michael J. Farrell: Yes. We have good relationships with all those segments of customers from large nationals to regionals, to mom and pops. As to the exact change of it over time, I'm going to hand it to Jim Hollingshead for some thoughts there. Jim? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Mick. The consolidation has been a gradual tectonic move in the channel over the last several years. And I think it will continue at that. Logically, you might expect a little bit of acceleration to consolidation because of CB2, but right now, we're not seeing a massive step change on that basis. And bear in mind, too, that DME is such a local business, that in many cases the local setup shall still be done by DMEs who are now subcontracting, right? So I continue to see it as a more gradual movement. Michael J. Farrell: Partnerships like our partnership with Brightree really help the regionals. We've got EDI partnerships which really helped the nationals. We've got PCP awareness which helps the mom and pops, the regionals and the nationals. So we're willing to partner across the segments and across the categories of customers and products, and we see it as a pretty solid and steady move going forward, would be my summary there. Operator : Our next question is Dan Hurren with UBS. Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : We've noticed, when we're talking to the market, that there's a range of deals out there -- as we'd expect for sort of discounts of volumes and those sorts of things -- just wondering how they impact the P&L over time, and the other discounts. Upfront or is there a count-back? Does a customer have to do a certain volume before they get the rebate? So will that hit the P&L later on? Just wondering how that flows through over time. Michael J. Farrell: Brett, you want to talk about how we count for our deals? Brett A. Sandercock: I mean, they'll be a combination of all those, Dan, really. And on things like volume rebate and so on, what you do there is you have to be -- it's pretty dynamic in terms of estimating where you think volume is going to be. And then if we think they're going to hit those, then we certainly accrue as we go. So it's not like you're just going to get lumped with them all of a sudden. That will be spread out through the course of the year or whenever the volume contract is over. And then, of course, you have to make a call on what you think's really sticking and what you think that particular customer will achieve in terms of volumes. Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So, I guess what I'm trying to understand is that are we seeing sales today that will actually result in lower sales when the rebates gets headed back in future periods. Brett A. Sandercock: No. No, because we'd be accruing or offsetting an accrual for that rebate as we go. Operator : Our next question is Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Jeffrey Chu : This is Jeff filling in for Jason. Wanted to switch gears a bit and ask about the termination of the distribution agreement with CareFusion, which I think you announced about this time 1 year ago. First off, is this timing correct? And secondly, I was hoping you'd quantify the U.S. Flow Generator business during the quarter that were from products that were part of this distribution agreement. I'm just trying to understand the impact over the next several quarters, as you anniversary this termination of this agreement. Michael J. Farrell: Jeff, the distribution agreement with CareFusion was immaterial 1 year ago, and it remain immaterial now. How we're distributing the Stellar range of products which were involved in that agreement is that we have our own respiratory account managers across the U.S. market, which is where that bill is focused. And our respiratory account managers and our respiratory clinical specialists, who are part of our core sales force, have picked up this product. And we did better in our first quarter with our team selling our product than another team trying to sell our product over 1 whole year. So we're seeing some good momentum with Stellar, which has done incredibly well in France and Germany, where it was primarily designed for. But some really good upside opportunities that have come to us in the U.S. But, particularly, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, Stellar is a great product in the Americas geography, for Brazil, where we see the need for home care ventilation. And in some of those emerging markets, our products that are in the value space in respiratory care, have a great opportunity in that geography. So, in the Americas, I'd say one of the best geographic opportunities is right there in Brazil. But here in the U.S., we've taken over that distribution and we've started to move pretty well in it. And there's more, as I said in my opening remarks, in this market, through the end of fiscal '14, we're going to see some very interesting platform launches in the respiratory care space. Operator : Our next question is Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : One on mix and one on the overall U.S. market. On mix, I know you don't tend to give mix on Flow Generators, but certainly, APAP over CPAP has been a driver. It seems that, that was a driver in gross margin in this quarter as well. So I'm wondering if you can just give us an update on the runway there is still left in that mix shift as we move more towards APAP over CPAP. Michael J. Farrell: Yes, so we won't break it out, Anthony. But what I'll say is that, with 35% of the diagnoses in the U.S. market being home sleep testing, pretty much every prescription that comes from a home sleep test requires some type of APAP device. And so there's a sort of good relationship between us. It's not necessarily one for one, because physicians get to see products like the S9 order set and get to love it and want to use it for many of their patients and prescribe it for [indiscernible] from the lab as well as from HST. But if you're looking for an indicator, that may be one that can help you in your calculations for working the downstream split between APAP and CPAP. But one thing remains, is that there is a positive mix shift from CPAP to APAP. Why? Well, of course there's the HST trend in the U.S. market. But if you look at other markets around the world, APAP, and particularly the S9 order set, has gained share because it's better for patients. It adjusts during the night, it adjusts night to night and it is very good long-term care. And so we're seeing good outcomes from that. There's people focused more on the outcomes and the value of therapy. We're seeing products like the S9 order set get more and more attention. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : That's very helpful. And then just on the U.S. market, just going back to reimbursement trends overall. I know in the past you've touched on private reimbursement relative to CMS. Is there an update as to where they stand relative to CMS at this point? And perhaps, again, as you look forward, is there any indication of direction or where private pays may be going? Michael J. Farrell: Yes, sure, Anthony. Well, as I said earlier in the Q&A here, CMS announced CB2 in February, it went into effect in July and we saw some effect in Q1. But private payers, during the last 90 days, did what they've done over the last 9 years, which is the steady reductions over time, by geography, by state. There's been business as usual as we look across the private payer space within the U.S. market. Operator : We are now at the 1 hour mark, so I will turn the call back over Mick Farrell for his closing remark. Michael J. Farrell: Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for coming and listening in on this call. I'd like to say thanks to our investors, to the analysts and our many customers who listen to this conference call. Importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to the 4,000-strong global ResMed team, from Asia-Pac, Europe and the Americas, for your hard work, dedication and continued excellence. Together, we are improving, literally, millions -- multiple millions of lives in respiratory medicine, 1 breath at a time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the Q1 2014 ResMed Inc. earnings conference call. Thank you, all, for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Earnings Call. My name is Sherry and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded. Before we begin, ResMed has asked me to remind you that during this call ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from those forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is included in the ResMed SEC filings which are available on the company's website. (Operator Instructions) Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO, and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Sherry, and thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I will review the highlights of our fiscal Q2 and then I will hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in some more detail. So first the financial summary. Global revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 grew by 2% year-on-year to $384 million, that\u2019s up 1% on a constant currency basis. Europe, Asia, and rest of the world headline revenue increased 8% for the quarter to $178 million, which is 5% on constant currency terms. Americas revenue decreased by 2% to $207 million. We believe the long-term global growth rate for our industry remains in the 6% to 8% range. Net income for the quarter increased 11% to $86.6 million. GAAP EPS increased by 13% to $0.60 for the quarter, while hybrid EPS which includes the amortization of intangibles, was $0.61 per share. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from the global team. Let me start with the Americas, where clearly we had some external headwinds and where we were not satisfied with the results. The Americas had a challenging quarter with overall sales decreasing by approximately $5 million year-on-year, which was 2% on a year-on-year basis. It's interesting to note that it was approximately $5 million increase on a quarter-to-quarter basis which is a 3% sequential quarter-to-quarter increase. Sales revenues from masks were flat year-on-year while flow generator sales revenue declined by 5% year-on-year. It's also of note that we were up against some very tough prior year comparisons in both those categories. Float generators were up 16% in Q2 fiscal 2013 and masks were also up 16% 12 months ago in Q2 fiscal '13. However, the result was not solely a reflection on these comparables. I will walk through the two key areas of impact in this regard. Firstly, competitive bidding, and secondly, competitor actions in the marketplace. So first, on competitive bidding. U.S. market dynamics were challenging in Q2 and remain challenging today as we have been discussing. The distraction we saw in Q1 continued throughout Q2. As we had indicated it would on our core. And our customers have grappled with the U.S. reimbursement changes that went into effect in July for Medicare patients, which is a CB2. As we discussed on our Q1 call, winners and losers of competitive bids adjusted their market strategies and structures. And this temporary distraction caused a net reduction in sales volumes for the quarter. Patients are navigating their way through the new HME landscape while HME providers simultaneously try to ensure that patients they are picking up meet their reimbursement and documentation criteria. This occasionally causes what are so called orphan patients, who are not able to be serviced by the old or a new HME. And this has reduced net volumes for the quarter. This also impacts new patients as winning HMEs establish a presence in territories through subcontracts, acquisitions of assets or Greenfield [indiscernible]. As we work through these challenges with our U.S. HME customers, we continue to believe that this interruption in volume is temporary. Customers are developing new business models and footprints and finding ways to serve both new and existing patient needs. While it is hard to predict the future precisely, we continue to think that there is a number of months before the market stabilizes. The key signs we see indicating that this the case are that the distraction is beginning to recede in some leading indicators in the U.S. market. First, we continue to see new patient growth in the U.S., in PCP visits, in elective procedures, and in referrals to sleep physicians. Second, many of our U.S. customers are picking up existing and new patient volume through asset purchases and referral pathway development. The other key area I want to walk through in regard to competitor actions. We saw impact from our competitors in Q2 in addition to the external market conditions. On the product introduction front we saw strong competition in both the nasal mask and the nasal pillows categories. Product introductions from our major competitors have reversed some portion of the share gains that we have had in these two categories over the last number of years. Competitive pricing, particularly in the CPAP category, also influenced our results. And we are establishing appropriate value pricing premiums to ensure that we get back to taking share in that category too. Let me go into a little more detail on product introduction. We are executing to our plan that we talked about in our Q1 call to bring a strong product pipeline to the market. This product innovation dynamic is returned to the competitive product cycle that we have demonstrated for over two decades in this market. We are confident that our new product offerings and our pipeline can address this challenge. It is a game we have played before and we know that we can win. Last quarter we said we would launch three new masks throughout this fiscal year and we are executing well against that plan. At the beginning of last week, we launched the AirFit P10, our latest nasal pillows system. This is our quietest mask to date. It is 50% quieter than the market category leader, our existing Swift FX. The AirFit P10 is literally whisper quiet. It is also 50% lighter, weighing in at just 1.6 ounces. And finally, its revolutionary vent technology which we call quite air, gently diffuses the air, minimizing disturbance to both the patient and their bed partner. After only two weeks in the market, the AirFit P10 has received many positive reviews in social media, on the online stores, and from patients who have tried the product with our U.S. HME customers. I personally have been using this product for the last two months and I got to tell you, it's the most comfortable, quite and effective mask that we have brought to the market. Continuing with our announced product innovation plan, we will launch two additional new masks during the balance of fiscal year 2014. We expect them to similarly be well received by patients, providers, physicians and patients. Let me also go into a little more detail on pricing. Clearly the pricing environment is very competitive in the Americas, pricing declines impacted our results across the board in the U.S., but especially in our CPAP product category. Going forward we will continue to evaluate our price premium, category by category, segment by segment. And we will ensure that we are appropriately positioned reflecting both the current market realities and the superior value proposition that our products deliver to our patients and to our providers. Importantly, I want to let you know that for competitive reasons, we are not going to announce the details of our average selling price changes. Whether global or by region, or by product segment. The reason behind this is that one, other market participants do not publically reveal their amount of detail, and two, we are concerned this information may affect us in the marketplace. In short, we don\u2019t believe doing so is in the best interests of our shareholders. Finally, on the Americas and before turning to Europe, Asia and rest of the world, there are a few bright spots in the Americas results for Q2. We saw good growth of our Adapt SV and Stellar devices, reflecting our emerging growth in both cardiology and respiratory care markets. The Stellar received regulatory approval in Brazil during the quarter and we are encouraged about the prospect for respiratory care in the Latin America market over the coming years. The VPAP COPD, which is the first and only device with an FDA clearance with an indication for use to treat COPD, is gaining traction in respiratory care. And finally, accessories sales for both flow generators and for masks was solid, reflecting growth in the installed base. And the fact that many of our customers despite competitive bidding continued to drive an increased their focus on patient replenishment programs. So now I am going to switch to on our review on Europe where we saw good growth with solid performances in many countries, including European dealer network, the U.K., Switzerland and both our German dealer business as well as our German homecare business. Two of the main drivers of growth in Europe were our respiratory care and cardiology markers, including in particular the products, Stellar and AutoSet CS, which both produced good growth. It's interesting to note that in Europe plus Asia and rest of the world, our flow generator growth year-on-year was plus 6% constant currency. We also contribution from our recently released mask products in that region, the Quattro Air and the Nano. In France, the previously announced telemonitoring requirements went into effect October the first, right at the start of the quarter. We believe this development started to help and will help grow our share in flow generators in the region. The emerging focus on healthcare informatics in France and throughout Europe as it grows, plays to ResMed's strength. We are seeing interesting in EasyCare Online solutions both within France but now outside France in various parts of Europe, where customer's recognize EasyCare Online is efficient and provides adherence benefits and high quality. It also has incredibly strong and robust data protection that is increasingly important for these markets and also for our global customers. We continued to expand our reach in Eastern Europe during the quarter, building on our recent acquisition that we announced in Q1 in Poland. In December we acquired Unimedis, which is a Czech Republic based distributor of sleep disordered-breathing and respiratory care products. The Czech Republic has a population of over 10 million and its healthcare spending ranks just below the general European level and has more physicians per capita than most other EU countries. This acquisition allows us to drive market growth in emerging markets opportunity in Eastern Europe, in Poland and now Czech Republic across sleep disordered-breathing, homecare ventilation, as well as cardiology markets. In the Asia Pacific region, sales growth was light. Although we were encouraged by progress in our cardiology sales in Japan, overall sales to our Japanese customers were not as strong as we would have hoped. We expect Asia-Pac to be stronger in the second half of this fiscal year as patient flow remains solid in the region overall. And we are partnering with our customers in the regions to do so. We saw good growth in China in Q2 and we remain confident in the long-term opportunities of emerging markets in Asia-Pac, as well as the more established markets in the region of Japan and Australia, New Zealand. Turning to R&D. In addition to the patient interface product development that we mentioned on our press release earlier in the call, we are also making good progress in our respiratory care pipeline. We are on track to launch our next generation respiratory care platform in Europe during this fiscal year, with a subsequent launch into the Americas and then into Asia-Pac. We have a strong R&D team focused on bringing meaningful innovation to the market and the benefit to patients, physicians and providers in this space. It includes the diseases of COPD, neuromuscular disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and beyond. We are very encouraged by the results of the first patients who are being put on this next generation respiratory care product and we will go into further detail in the coming quarters. In short, horizon two of our three horizons growth strategy, which is this respiratory care market, is lining up for growth in Europe and then the Americas and Asia-Pac. Watch this space. Let me close with this. We remain focused on the long run. Our markets remain underpenetrated and absolutions provide symptomatic relief of patients while slowing the progression of key chronic diseases, while saving money to the entire healthcare system. We have the right solutions, we have the right people, and we have the right strategy to succeed. We are confident that we will continue to do so. Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the December quarter was $394.3 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. While in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 1%. Income from operations for the quarter was $105 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, and net income for the quarter was $86.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for the quarter, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the December quarter was 64.7%, an increase of 290 basis points compared to Q2 FY '13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing improvements, favorable product mix and favorable currency movements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 65%, assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structure. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $111.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. While in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% compared to the year ago figure of 28.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 29% for fiscal year 2014. R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.5 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 5%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.7% compared to the year ago figure of 8.1%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline, tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar as the majority of our research and development is undertaken in Australia. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 20.8%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $206.6 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter. While sales outside the Americas totaled $177.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $88.7 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other sales were $117.9 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $118.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $59.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1%, while masks and other also increased by 1%. Cash flow from operations was $84.2 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $19.7 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $18.6 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for consideration of $74 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 2.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $537 million, and at December 31, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion. I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : I actually have two. The first one happens to be, how much of the foreign exchange uptick year-over-year is associated with foreign exchange. Michael Farrell : Brett? Brett Sandercock : How much of the earnings? Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : Well, no. I mean your -- the gross margin was up well over 200 basis points year-over-year, almost 300 basis points. And I am just wondering how much of that is from foreign exchange. Brett Sandercock : On the margin, yes. So on the year-over-year, Joanne, on the FX was about 140 basis points of that. Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : And that\u2019s mostly related to the Aussie, the Australian dollar? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Predominantly. We have a -- there is a little bit of benefit from the euro but that\u2019s predominantly the Aussie dollar weakening. Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. And then I understand why you don\u2019t want to talk about your pricing paradigm, but can you step back and talk a little bit about what's happening to pricing in the industry? Michael Farrell : Yes, Joanne, I mean they are pretty much the same thing asking what we are doing in pricing, what the industry is doing with pricing. Given that we want to maintain our appropriate value premium over our competitors but ensure that we are competitively priced to make sure we get back to taking share. So specifically within the U.S. market, we are looking at our value premiums and ensuring, based upon the market dynamics that are going on throughout Q1 and as we saw in Q2, to make sure that we get back to taking share across the segments. So we are looking at pricing on a category by category basis and SKU by SKU basis and the segment by segment basis, based upon how the customers look at it. But to qualify that, whether by industry or by us, we would sort be parallel and it doesn\u2019t make sense to break out either. It's just not in the interests of our shareholders to do so. Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Just [indiscernible] a little bit on that. One of the things I am seeing from other companies that have products with competitive bidding is that the other companies around them are dropping prices that they need to respond to. I am going to assume that\u2019s what's going on in your world also. Michael Farrell : Look, Joanne, we are the value premium leader. We don\u2019t generally in our industry move down ahead of the curve. So I think that\u2019s a safe assumption to say and, yeah, it's safe to say that we are more responding on the downward approach and trying to find and elicit the appropriate premium to maintain across each of the SKUs. And we have got pretty good signs behind this and it's really just an adjustment of external dynamics with our internal dynamics to make sure that all makes sense. But the premise does sound like what we have been executing to. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David Clair of Piper Jaffray. David Clair - Piper Jaffray : So I was just hoping, Mick, in the commentary you talked about a moderating impact to competitive bidding in the quarter. Can you just give us some additional thoughts there? And I know you talked about 6% to 8% global growth, do you think that U.S. grew as a market or did it decline? And when do you think that we should expect ResMed to kind of rebound and put up positive growth in the U.S. Michael Farrell : Yes. I mean clearly in the U.S. market, we talk about 6% to 8% as the long-term growth of this industry. Clearly there is some impacts through competitive biddings. We talked about the patients who get moving from HME A to HME B, you know these last 90 days, that will have some impact on the growth. We don\u2019t have it down to the decimal point, and to your point, it doesn\u2019t make sense to go there. But the leading indicators that we see that -- and we have a lot of data on this and some of it's public. And we have shared that on our latest investor presentation that patient flow to primary care physicians are picking up. Patient flow for elective procedures which are analogous to referrals for sleep-disordered breathing, such as hip and knee replacements, are starting to move up. Referrals specifically in our industry to sleep-disordered breathing specialists are starting to move up on the diagnostic front. So all these leading indicators are macro and generally public, and allow us to talk about them. We have many other indicators that we have customer by customer as they buy assets of patients. So they are starting to monetize that asset. Getting the pipe work together. Working with patients to ensure that pipe works is of the standard of the acquiring HME versus the HME who sold the asset, and ensuring that they can get that replenishment revenue and get the patients back on the right care that\u2019s needed to happening there. So they are the sort of what we would call, David, the green shoots of growth that we are seeing on these leading indicators to make us believe that the impact of competitive bidding is beginning to moderate in the market. We are not done but there are green shoots starting to appear which, as we look forward the next 12, 24, 36 months, we see a whole lot of opportunity. The change that we often get asked that is, will be it a one month or a three month, or a five month. We don\u2019t know exactly. And so we say it's a number of months for those green shoots to start turning to moderation of the entire market and for us to, as an industry, get back on the growth track. And we think we are well positioned to do that, we are partnering with our HME customers to do that. David Clair - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the pipeline, I mean obviously you guys have a lot of stuff going on there. Can you give us a sneak peek at Medtrade? Should we expect some material product launches coming up here? Michael Farrell : So David, we don\u2019t give sneak peeks on any trade show. Not one for Medtrade or about trade shows in medicare in Europe or elsewhere. But I will recite what I said, that we have three amazing new masks coming this fiscal year. The first one is out there, the AirFit P10. The other two masks will go on other categories and they are very exciting. Can't give you any details, David. I can tell you that we have a respiratory care next generation platform that has had its first patient on therapy already in Europe, and we are excited about a full product launch of that product before the end of the fiscal year. That I can share with you. But no details on any of the trade shows throughout 2014, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Andrew of William Blair. Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: So let\u2019s see. If we think about volumes and new patients are growing and overall domestic CPAP was down 5%, in the lower side masks were flat. That has to suggest that existing patient volume on masks was -- volume was either negative or modestly positive if price is probably worse this quarter than it had been. Is that a fair way to characterize it? Michael Farrell : Well, Ben, you used a number of different parameters there. What we saw and I think what we said, is that in the quarter there were some volume impacts from competitive bidding. I mean that\u2019s clear. As a patient is moving from HME A to HME B and that asset is picked up, you know if they were on a replenishment cycle that was every three months and then they are changing from HME A to HME B over a three months or a six months process, that maybe one of those masks in terms of the pickup or one of those cushions in terms of the pickup is left out. So that temporary distraction is real for competitive bidding and will have an impact on market price within a particular period of time, for a particular DME. But to ramp that up over the 4000 to 6000 plus HMEs out there in the U.S. marketplace, it's really difficult to know exactly, you know precisely pick where that volume change is occurring. But the leading indicators of patient flow into the channel are there. The analogy that we used at JPMorgan last week is it's like you have got a garden hose, where the garden hose is the flow of patients is the water, and the garden hose has got a crimp in it, which is this competitive bidding. And it's a [indiscernible] bend in the curve of the pipe. And we starting to work with our HMEs to uncrimp or unkink that garden hose and the water is starting to flow. So the patients are starting to come through the channel and they will get to an HME. The new HMEs that are establishing in the areas where they have won have to establish referral pathways and pick up those patients. And even established HMEs have to ensure those referral pathways are solid. But as we look to the long-term, we see getting back to that 6% to 8% market growth rate as something we will absolutely do. This is not a structural change, it's a temporary change that will allow us to help the customers and get us back to growth. Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Mick, I guess my second question would be, as the HME customers obviously have seen their profitability tighten, they are clearly coming back at you guys and asking for concessions. You competitors are responding, you are not going to respond to them more aggressively, you are not going to give us pricing information anymore which I understand. But shouldn\u2019t we assume that this is a more permanent dynamic on the pricing side and that the volume as they come back over the course of time with the new patient flow that the structural growth rate has to be lower than it was before. Michael Farrell : So I will hand to Jim to go in a little more detail on the profitability of the HME customers and then I will come back to talk to your point about long-term and why I think we can get back to the 6% to 8%. Jim? James Hollingshead : Hi, Ben. I don\u2019t think the market dynamic that we are seeing now is a permanent market dynamic. I mean that\u2019s your question. I think what we are seeing, we have been talking internally about how to describe what we see going in the market, and the metaphor that we keep coming back to is, it's like a thunderstorm has passed through town. The storm is through but there is cleanup, right. And so -- and talking to our customers what we are seeing, we have talked about in this call before, is the things that our customers have to go through with doing subcontracting, and a lot of the larger customers are doing acquisitions, and as they do that they are buying a -- they are either buying a business whole or they are buying a list of patients. They then have to figure out how to get those patients in their replenishment systems and so on. There is a lot of logistics and administration that is working its way through the HME world right now. There is pricing pressure, there is clearly pricing pressure. And as Joann said earlier, you have seen that in all the competitive bid markets. But I don\u2019t think there is any reason to believe that what's going on right now is just sort of a new normal that will last forever. I think the market is working its way through what we have previously described as distraction. And I think over the next several months, and it makes very difficult to know how long that timeframe is, but over the next several months we will see it stabilize. So, no, I don\u2019t think this kind of challenge is a permanent challenge. I think we have to work our way through it as an industry and we are working with our customers to do that. Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Right. And, Jim, what I was trying to get at is that I think the value proposition for a user in a lower reimbursement environment to the HME is more compressed and so they are going to be more price sensitive to the higher end products or to any product, and less willing to step up on the mix side which is a structural change versus the ability you have had in the past to keep moving that mix a little bit higher and holding price as a result. That\u2019s what I am concerned about. Michael Farrell : I think the mix dynamic is still there, Ben, and here is why. The CPAP to APAP mix shift is still going even despite the compounding of the two effects. We talked about competitive bidding and the volume impact, the competitors actions and the pricing impact. So all that hit at once. Yet, still, we see some growth there for us. And as we are partnering with our customers to try and understand how to make that happen, the move to HST is implied. And we said somewhere between 30% to 35% of the tests, the diagnostic tests done in the U.S. were home sleep tests in the last 12 months. That will get to 40% within the next nine months. And it will then go to 45% and up and beyond. And we have said it many times, that the analogy is some markets in Europe, where you are talking about 70%-80% of the test being home sleep tests. This is sort of endpoint. That drives volume into the market. It allows more patients to get into the diagnostic channel who man not have gone to a PSG. This is all being driven by the insurance companies and payers but it has a benefit of providing more volume as a long-term. And the positive mix-shift, to your point on pricing, that allows that CPAP to APAP mix shift to happen. Additionally, for ResMed, as we start to launch more of our respiratory care products that we are launching in Europe and also launching in the Americas over the coming year or two, will have a mix shift for ResMed that allows us to move to higher end products. Where ASPs are just higher and there is mix shift from segment A to segment B that is a positive tailwind for us. So that\u2019s why as we look at the market and as we look at our opportunities, we think a 6% to 8% market growth rate makes a whole lot of sense. But going from the global macro, I will drill back down to your question which is on the Americas. Jim, do you have any more to add there? James Hollingshead : Yes, thank you, Mick. I just wanted to add one thing to that, Ben, which is, what we are seeing is actually what we have anticipated happening in the market. Which is as HMEs are working through the challenges that reimbursement cuts have posed for them, there is pricing pressure and that makes sense to us, but they are also looking for more efficiencies in their business. And so they are looking to a couple of things. Everybody wants to drive up their compliance rate and that actually works in our favor because our products have higher compliance, both on flow gen and on mask. The other thing they are looking to do is to get each patient compliant and then to get them into replenishment programs in the cost effective way. So that\u2019s why you have been seeing us focus on some of the [indiscernible] You have seen us improve EasyCare Online platform. You have seen us with our [indiscernible] subsidiary driving some automation into the business process. And you will continue to see things like that from us over the coming months. We are working with our customers -- you know our products still get a premium. They get a premium because they are better products but we continue to enjoy good position with the customers because we are helping to drive efficiencies into their business. And so we are very bullish on where we are taking our offering in that direction. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Matthew Prior of Bank of America. Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question in regards to the exit trajectory from the quarter. Mick, you spoke about, obviously, this being a question of months not necessarily quarters, in terms of when we see those green shoots having benefit. But in terms of the three months of the quarter can you talk us through, given the last six months of seeing the impact of competitive bidding, was September the darkest month of the six? To give us a sense as to how that line would look over the six months. Michael Farrell : Yes. To determine the exact trajectory of this combines a whole bunch of factors across 4000 to 6000 customers, and as they look at their patient referrals in and as they look at subcontracting, as they look at building facilities, and as they look at developing new organic referral pathway. So to pick down exactly where the nadir is and when the curve starts to move up, is very difficult. And that\u2019s why we are here saying, look, it's going to be a number of months for us to get through this and we don\u2019t know exactly how many. You know by customer of course you have all the dynamics going on, but if customer A buys customer B than one has a 100 percent growth, they are doubling, and the other is going to zero. Yet, the volume remains the same. So putting that across the whole weighted average of our customers is a difficult equation. And then you are predicting other market dynamics as to who is going to be better at developing referral models to cardiologists or to new pulmonary referral sources, or within the U.S. market as the development of the accountable care organizations or ACOs, where hospitals and primary care physicians are now working together with shared costs. You have other dynamics of cost and volume that go in on a market-by-market basis. So predicting exactly where the bottom is and how many months it is to see the trajectory moving up is very, very difficult, Matt. Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, I guess to clarify, Mick, what I was really after was, do you think that second quarter is the worst that we have seen in terms of all the dynamics going on around price and competitive effect and irrationality out in the marketplace, and behavior of DMEs and disruption of patients finding equipment? Is it just a question of the rate of exit in terms of things get better from here or given the dynamics are still in flux, could we see, obviously, another quarter of weaker performance than what we have seen? I am trying to get a sense as to the dynamics you have seen, how long have they been going on to the extent of could things get worse from here, or is it just a question of the rate of trajectory out of the quarter? Michael Farrell : Yes. You listed about 15 things which we are trying to predict all of them as we go forward. And to say precisely on all those 15, we don\u2019t know. Here is the thing we can control. We can control our new product launch. And we just launched the AirFit P10, which in its first two weeks if flying off the shelf. We will be launching two other new masks between here and June 30 that similarly have huge opportunities for value generation. For patients, providers and for physicians. And we are also launching, I would call a leapfrog next-generation respiratory care system that I might ask Geoff Neilson to talk about some of its value as we have started to get our first patients on therapy in Europe for. So we know that we have the pipeline to start delivering and turning to strong growth here, and to get back to share gain in some of the categories like nasal masks and nasal pillows. And then also in the CPAP category with regard to appropriate pricing. So we have got the plan of action ready to go. And I will go back to what I said in the early notes when I said at the start of your question, Matt, which is, it's a number of months for us to get back to that growth trajectory but there a number of bits in play. Some are macroeconomic that we can't control. Some are directly within our control, like delivery of products. And we have done a pretty darn good job over the last two plus decades on that and we plan to execute on that over the coming 6-12 and beyond. Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Mick, understood. My second question is in regards to France. You know given the changes to reimbursement there and obviously informatics. Have you seen anything in terms of the second quarter around mask consumption relating to those informatics in France in terms of that shift that has occurred? Michael Farrell : I will hand to Rob Douglas to talk about that France and the HI. Robert Douglas : Yes, thanks, Mick. Matt, the French business has been going well. We are encouraged by the performance of our system, our online system and how we are picking up all the patient numbers and managing the data. And also compiling with all of the privacy rules and that type of thing, which are quite complex throughout Europe. We think that\u2019s performing well. In terms of, other sort of structural changes in terms of mask usage and things like that, it's still too early days to make a comment on that. But we are pretty happy with the way the French business has been going in the light of those changes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Low of Deutsche Bank. David Low - Deutsche Bank : If we just switch in to the rest of world [indiscernible] right there. Mick, you began talking about that you think market growth could be 6% to 8% again. Help us understand why rest of world growth, constant-currency growth, I think is 5% versus that 6% to 8%. What's holding back that business or perhaps the market outside the U.S. at the moment? Michael Farrell : Yes. So, David, the line was cutting in and out a little bit, but you were asking about Europe, Asia and rest of the world growth and who to get that to the 6% to 8% range. Look there are many impacts that are -- I mean counties obviously when we say Europe, Asia and rest of the world. We are talking about the other 99 countries we are in other than the U.S. But within those markets there are many different market dynamics. We talked in some detail in the call earlier about Japan being soft in Q1 and also being soft in Q2. We think there is some tailwind for us potentially in Asia Pac as we look to Q3 and Q4. So that has an opportunity to get us back to stronger growth rates and we think that can help get the rest of world number to where it should be. Look, I got to tell you, I was incredibly impressed by our European team. We don\u2019t breakdown the particular countries within the Europe or the particular countries within Asia Pac. But there was some really good performances, particularly in Northern Europe, within our teams of partnering with insurance systems. Understanding the total value of the healthcare system and how ResMed takes patients with providers. Takes patients out a hospital, puts them in the home, and treats them more cost effectively and saves money for the healthcare system. And when you have socialized medicine and governments involved in healthcare, as you do in northern Europe, they'd very heavily involved in analyzing all that. So we have a lot of partnerships in the U.K. and Northern Europe that are moving us down that road and we are very excited about it. So as we look to that long-term and talk about 6% to 8% market growth. And do I feel confident that our Europe, Asia, and rest of the world group can achieve in that range, I absolutely do. We have got the right strategy, we have got the right people, and they are starting to execute on it. There will always be some lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter but as you look forward over 4, 8, 12 quarters, we can absolutely see our growth being very solid within that range. David Low - Deutsche Bank : Great, thanks very much. And just coming back to the U.S. Trends in the mix shift through auto setting devices and then bilevel devices. I know you have mentioned it particularly the gross margin, but just wondering with this move to competitive bidding and DMEs being under pressure, are you seeing any sort of pushback towards a basic CPAP where in the past you were seeing a trend to auto setting devices? Michael Farrell : Look, this is all being driven by the payer and insurance companies, right. When they move the market from PSG to HST, they are driving it. And so when the payer establishes a home sleep testing protocol, it's going to require that the device that goes out is an APAP. Because otherwise you have to bring them back into the lab to get them titrated. So payers are generally driving the HST shift. They are also then driving the APAP shift. So that\u2019s just a fact. It's going to happen. The bilevel opportunity is really about a broader opportunity which is about non-invasive ventilation. And the idea there is bringing something that\u2019s been pretty well established in Western Europe, which is using non-invasive ventilation to treat patients with COPD, neuromuscular disease and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, to bring more of that and to grow that category within the Americas market. I am going to ask Geoff Neilson to talk a little bit about our global respiratory care business and how that might apply to allow us to get some of that positive mix shift in our ventilators. Geoff Neilson : So if we take COPD as an example, you know bilevel treatment for COPD in Europe is well established, particularly in Germany and ResMed is competing well in that space. There is a huge opportunity for COPD globally, including in the U.S. But it's somewhat muted by the reimbursement pathways to actually get patients on to therapy. However, on the other side, that has created some larger opportunities around higher-end ventilation products for COPD. And that\u2019s a segment that should really be growing quickly. So that brings me into the our ventilation platform, which can be positioned for COPD in the U.S. and also globally across the range for life-support and ventilation. So our Astro platform, we have started market trials in Europe. So we have had significant number of patients on that device now. It's being incredibly well received. As Mick mentioned there, this is a leapfrog platform that was developed from scratch over the past year and we are looking forward to launching that globally, but certainly in Europe by the end of this fiscal year. And depending on FDA timing and so on, as soon as we have a 510(k) approval, we will route further up our ventilation sales force in the U.S. and start driving into that couple of hundred million dollar market with this product, which is replacing our Elis\u00e9e and VS ranges [ph]. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall of UBS. Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Actually, just to take up that point on ventilation. You mentioned it's been growing quickly and I know you don't break it out at the quarter. But could you just characterize it at the quarter? Was it actually growing and did it contribute to growth in this quarter? Michael Farrell : Yes. So Andrew we don\u2019t break out ventilation and we will, as Geoff talked to, it's a material opportunity for us, but not yet by country and by segment a material business that we will break out as yet. But we are very excited about that product launch. And you know over the coming quarter, two or three, we will start to go into more detail as to the product launch and how that moves over time. We are already quite well established respiratory care player in some countries in Europe. So the product will roll into an existing referral and sales channel that we have already developed. In other markets, as Geoff was talking about the U.S. market and some others globally, we are developing the referral channels and the pipeline as well as bringing the product to market. So it's an S curve that will go rapidly in some countries and slowly in other countries. But specially to your question, Andrew, we are not going to break out the details in Q2 but as we look to going forward we will give more details of the products as it's launched in each of the different geographies worldwide. Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Okay, and just with the masks, I think going into this quarter, you would have full contribution from the Quattro full face Air and the Swift Nano FX. Obviously from the quarters, there is a lot of noise in the numbers, pretty difficult to understand sort of what traction you're getting. Could you just again characterize what they might have been doing on an underlying basis? Michael Farrell : Yes. So Quattro Air was launched sort of mid-calendar year. So we are in month five or six of that. We are actually seeing in the full face category, we are doing pretty well and Quattro Air is a strong part of that. And we like what Quattro Air is doing and customers seem to like the fact that it's 3.3 ounces and incredibly light on the face for the category of patients, the segment of patients that it's able to treat, the Quattro Air is doing well. Having said that, the Mirage Quattro and the Quattro FX, the other two full face masks we have are also holding share quite well. So we are reasonably comfortable with those. The Swift FX Nano has had a good start up, particularly in Europe, Asia and rest of the world. I mean masks were up, 6% headline and 4% constant currency in rest of the world. So the Swift FX Nano has started to have a pull up. But it was launched in the September timeframe in the U.S. and a little later in Europe so we haven't seen as much material contribution from that in the nasal category. But we are looking forward to that over time. But we are also, Andrew, looking very much forward to the next two masks and what contribution they are going to bring as we look forward. Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Okay, and just a final bit of housekeeping. Just going to ask the FX contribution to EPS, and I think we got that number here from Brett? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Andrew that was $0.05 this quarter, the EPS impact. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Abbott of Goldman Sachs. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs : My first one is around share loss in masks. Do you think you're losing share just in new patients or do you think there is some spillover into existing patients? Michael Farrell : So as you know we don\u2019t sell directly to patients so we don\u2019t have any idea as to whether it's a new patient or an existing patient. In the U.S. market we sold to distributors who move that forward. As we look at the temporary distraction from competitive bidding impacting as well as the competitor actions of new product launches, particularly in nasal masks and nasal pillows categories. There is a whole combination of factors going on there. It's very difficult to discern that. And underlying fundamental is that it is difficult to switch existing patients out. So like a comfortable pair of jeans or a pair of shoes that you love wearing, you tend to stick to the same ones. It's difficult to get a patient, particularly something they were every night if they are comfortable and happy. Firstly, you probably don\u2019t want to do it if you are physician or a patient. And then even the provider who might have some margin gain. The margin gain of that versus the margin loss of potentially losing the patient to another HME or not being able to switch the patient and spending the cost to do so, generally means that they are not switched as often. Having said that, we believe that the new products, the three new products that we are bringing out this fiscal year, the AirFit P10 and the two others, will allow us to get back to rapid gain of new patients and establish therefore installed base that should be a replenishment for years to come on that basis. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs : Great, and my second question was around the cost side of things. You have raised your guidance on SG&A from 28% to 29%. R&D, you pushed the guidance just to a straight 8%, previously 7% to 8%. Is that a function of higher investment or is that more a function of lower expected sales outlook? And I suppose if there is, if it's the latter, I'm just wondering how much ability is there to start to trim those expenses and how long would that take? Brett Sandercock : Yes, Ian, there is rough estimates or a range where we think it will be. So I mean that can easily move around from that number so it's not kind of, probably not the precision that you are thinking about. We have got this pipeline through on product and so on so you can expect R&D will really, I think to some extent a factor of a pretty solid pipeline in R&D that we are undertaking. And also we are taking a foot off in terms of R&D and what we are doing there. And in SG&A we need to contain those. I think we have done a reasonable job and we will continue to make sure we are spending effectively and efficiently. But we will certainly be investing in some of these newer growth areas around respiratory care, around cardiology. Geoff mentioned earlier in terms of ramping up, for example, in the sales force in the U.S. when the time is appropriate to support sales there. So there is a number of those programs or projects that we definitely want to support. But notwithstanding that, clearly we want to continue to leverage on SG&A and make sure we are driving R&D expenditure efficiently. So we will continue to do that. So the short answer, yes, I think there is scope that I think that we can continue to be effective in those areas and drop that benefit to the bottom line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Saul Hadassin of Credit Suisse. Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse : Mick, just two questions. First one is, I think in your opening remarks you spoke to what was happening on the competitive dynamics on the CPAP side of the business. I assume you were referring to fixed pressure devices. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color as to what you are seeing there, whether it's share loss as opposed to just competitive pricing and just what your response is to that? And the second question is, just with regards to your customer, well, to your DME customers, whether you are actually seeing any consolidation yet, actual closures of particularly small to medium-sized players? Thanks. Michael Farrell : It sounds like a U.S. folks [ph] question. Jim, you want to address that too? James Hollingshead : Sure, I shall. So, yes, the CPAP dynamic that Mick was referring to in the opening comments was about the fix pressure devices. What we are seeing is continued growth in the AutoSet or APAP part of the market. There is a mix shift underway across the whole markets. AutoSet where we continue to do well. In CPAP what we are seeing is increased pricing pressure, especially at the low end. That is a decreasing part of the market. So the low-end CPAP is actually a smaller part of the market than mid-tier CPAP which is, it's about smaller than AutoSet. And that we are seeing more severe pricing pressure at the low-end. So we have lost some share and there is pressure down in that part of the market. And as we said in the opening comment, we are looking hard at how we want to be positioned in that space in terms of -- we have a great offering, we are looking hard how we want to be positioned as the category declines and we see pricing pressure there. Michael Farrell : And the second one was with regard to DME customers and consolidation. And on that one, Saul, clearly we have -- 4000 to 6000 plus HMEs in the U.S. market. There are some changes as we talked about as we go through. I liked the analogy of the storm going through and it's led some order there. There is some cleanup there and there will be some consolidation and we have seen, and some of that has been public of some of these companies selling their assets from company A to company B. And the fundamental is that the patients are there, the volume is there and it will increase over the coming years. And so to what extent there is consolidation, we can't precisely tell but we are working with those who won bids within the competitive bidding environment and those who are bidding on the future. And as we look around the HME landscape, there are definitely signs of an HME that is planning for future growth. If an HME is investing in EasyCare Online, is driving usually to drive patient engagement and get patients adherent to care. And if an HME is using our electronic data in the change and programs to say, use our billing systems, such as say Brightree, where you can do a one stop shop and click to purchase ResMed products. Then they are thinking about efficiency, they are thinking about scale, they are thinking about cost and they are thinking about the long-term. And they are the type of HMEs that we are spending a lot of time working with to say what's an appropriate price premium for our products and what value will it drive for you in the market over the next 6, 12, 24 months. And we are working through all that. So we are very confident that we are working with those who are investing in the long term for this industry and those who are preparing for the long-term growth that we see of patients coming through the channel. Both in sleep and in home care, respiratory care and as longer-term, as we are already doing in Europe and Japan, in the cardiorespiratory space. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Ben Haynor of Feltl and Company. Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company : Just had a bit of a mechanics question on product introductions. When you introduce, say a new mask, do you typically see larger stocking orders to the DMEs and HMEs when the product is first introduced than you might see in subsequent quarters? Or is the reorder rate often enough where that doesn't factor in? Michael Farrell : Yes, Ben, it's more often than not it's an S curve that goes up over time. There is not usually large lump at the start, it's more around spending time with the physicians, spending time with the providers, and spending time working with the channel to help get them familiar with the benefits of a new mask. For instance the AirFit P10, being 50% quieter and 50% lighter, you have to sit down there with the doctor and explain and show the benefits for it. And I think there is some early clinical data and a white paper showing, a patient gets 40 minutes more of sleep from that product, for instance. So you then need to talk to the physician and get them onboard with that. You have to talk to the provider to make sure it's on their schedule and negotiate pricing and so on. So it you like, it's an S curve with a bit of lag at the start, but then acceleration from there rather than the other way around. Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company : Okay, great. So with a product like the AirFit P10, we should expect to see that go up the S-curve as time goes on? Michael Farrell : Correct. Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company : Okay. Great, well, congrats on that product. It seems like it is blowing the doors off. Operator : And we are now at the 1 hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks. Michael Farrell : Well, thank you. And as always, I would like to say thanks to all of you on this conference call for your interest and support of ResMed. Most importantly, I would like to thank the global ResMed team for our focus on improving the lives of patients, one breath at a time. We are about 7.5 million patients improved over the last 12 months. I couldn\u2019t thank you enough. Thanks a lot. Bye bye. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Q3 2014 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. Thank you all for joining us today. Before we begin, ResMed has asked me to remind you that during this call ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the company\u2019s products. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is included in ResMed\u2019s SEC filings, which are available on the company\u2019s website. Please limit your questions to two at any one time. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO; and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead. Mick Farrell : Great. Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I\u2019ll review the highlights of our fiscal Q3 and then I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail. So, first, the financial summary. Global revenue in the third quarter of fiscal \u201814 grew 4% year-on-year to $398 million. That is up 3% on a constant currency basis. America\u2019s revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis at $216 million. Europe, Asia and rest of world headline revenue increased 8% for the quarter to $182 million, which is 6% growth in constant currency terms. Net income for the quarter increased 6% to $90 million. GAAP EPS increased by 9% to $0.63 per share for the quarter, while hybrid earnings per share which excludes the amortization of intangibles was $0.64 per share. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from our global team. Now, let me review the operating results in a little more detail. We look at our sales performance in the Americas in the context of year-on-year, as well as sequential quarterly results. Last year in Q3 of fiscal \u201813, we grew Americas revenue by 13%. Given this tough comparable and challenging market conditions in the U.S., keeping our topline flat on a year-over-year basis was a good result. Also, I\u2019d like to note that we grew the Americas revenue sequentially by 5% or around $9 million from Q2 to Q3. By category, in the Americas, revenue from masks grew by 2%. Flow generators declined by 2% year-over-year. We were up against very tough prior comparisons in the flow generator category, which grew at 21% during Q3 of last fiscal year. It\u2019s important to note that both of these categories on a sequential basis were an uptick from Q2 to Q3. U.S. market dynamics began to improve in Q3, although the environment is still evolving. New patient growth while still subdued is continuing and importantly, resupply to the installed base of patients is also growing. We continue to promote resupply and a nationwide research study we commissioned recently confirmed that resupply programs work. They provide better care for the patient and better results for the homecare provider and better outcomes for the payer. Our customers are also beginning to see stability in their businesses. As they adjust to the U.S. reimbursement changes from competitive bidding that went into effect in July last year for Medicaid patients in CB2. Many customers are growing back to -- getting back to growing patient volumes. These leading indicators tell us that the U.S. market is starting to stabilize. In January, just 90 days ago, in our Q2 call, we said that, we were going to adjust our pricing in response to competitive activity, particularly in the U.S. market and that played out during the quarter. We regained share during the quarter, although pricing adjustments were an offset to those volume gains, resulting in a flat quarter in revenue terms for the Americas. The U.S. market remains a highly competitive dynamic and going forward, we are going to make sure we are appropriately positioned for revenue growth as the competitive environment develops. We\u2019ll continue to use our innovation and our value propositions across the categories, including products, services and solutions to shape the variables that drive product preference and purchasing decisions. Our sales results for combined Europe and Asia-Pac and rest of world were led by constant currency growth in the mask category of 14%. The flow generator category across Europe, Asia-Pac and rest of world was 2%. We see upside for growth in this flow generator category going forward, with the launch of our respiratory care platform in these regions. And I\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes. Europe delivered another quarter of very solid revenue growth in Q3 as it did in Q2. Our wholesale businesses did particularly well in major markets France, Germany and the U.K., as well as across our European dealer network, which includes the emerging Eastern European acquisitions that we talked about last quarter Poland and the Czech Republic. Our teams in Europe are well-positioned for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We remained on track with our previously announced product introduction plans. We launched the AirFit P10 as promised during the last quarter and that product is selling very well in the U.S. It is just launching as we speak into Europe and Asia-Pacific. During our last conference call, we promised to deliver two additional new masks to the market this fiscal year. We delivered on that promise this week, with the launch of two more AirFit branded mask offerings. The first, the AirFit F10, where F stands for full-face is the lightest full-face mask on the market. The AirFit N10, where N stands for nasal mask, is a new patient-preferred nasal mask that is highly unobtrusive and allows patients to have clear line of sight. These products deliver what patients want most, a light, comfortable, unobtrusive mask that is easy to use. Our pre-launch testing demonstrated that patients prefer these new mask offerings to those currently on the market and we expect physicians and providers will like them too. We\u2019re launching both of these new masks during Q1 -- during Q4 in the U.S. and most other geographies and we will continue the launch throughout Q1 in fiscal \u201815. In the flow generator category, we\u2019re delivering on our commitment as we said and are moving forward to full commercial launch for our new respiratory care platform, the Astral. The Astral is a new life support ventilation system that has competitive advantages in size and weight and it\u2019s being very well received by patients and providers during the controlled product launch that we\u2019ve been conducting in Europe during Q3. This product solution will enrich life for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and neuromuscular disease. We are now ready to move to full commercial launch this quarter in most of our European and Asia-Pacific markets. We already have a strong homecare ventilation presence in these regions with a channel that\u2019s ready to go and the Astral will complement our existing respiratory care product offerings. We are in process for FDA clearance. Our 510(k) is submitted in the U.S. and we hope to launch in the U.S. later this calendar year. The hard work of our research and development teams is bearing fruit this quarter, with the multiple product launches across the globe running on schedule. And the strength of our design capability was recently validated when both the Astral and the AirFit P10 were awarded Red Dot Design awards. This is a global prestigious international product design competition, in fact, the largest design competition in the world and these two awards join our award from a few years ago. I think it was 2010 when we received the Red Dot for the S9 platform. Our clinical research continues to demonstrate the wide-ranging impact of sleep-disordered breathing on a variety of chronic conditions. I want to highlight three recent publications in this space before we go to Brett and then Q&A. First, on the clinical development front, there have been several recent studies suggesting intriguing links between sleep-disordered breathing and cancer. A pair of studies from 2012 and 2013 suggested an association between sleep apnea and increased risk of cancer incidence and mortality. Here in 2014 already, just earlier this month, Dr. Sina Gharib and his colleagues published a study in sleep, concluding that effective therapy of OSA with CPAP is associated with alterations in circulating leukocyte gene expression. They suggested potential novel mechanisms linking OSA with cancer-related pathways. It\u2019s too early to understand the workings of the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and cancer malignancy or the interactions of CPAP therapy with cancer progression definitively. However, these early investigations confirm the systemic impact of sleep-disordered breathing and the potential benefits offered by our therapies to patients in this category. Second, in a more commercially-oriented study, Dr. Julian Guest and his colleagues are publishing a study in May and it\u2019s already online in the journal Diabetes Care. They are reporting on a resident-sponsored U.K. based study on a cost and outcomes data over a five-year period, treating patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant obstructive sleep apnea. This study concluded that initiating treatment with CPAP in OSA patients with type 2 diabetes leads to significantly lower blood pressure and better control over the diabetes and it affords a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. So it improved outcomes and at better costs. Third and on the healthcare informatics front, the upcoming American Thoracic Society or ATS 2014 meeting, which will be here in San Diego next month, will feature a presentation demonstrating that our U-Sleep automated adherence and compliance program achieved positive patient outcomes with significant reductions in labor. The abstract of this presentation is already available online on the ATS website, so it\u2019s in the public domain and it shows that in a randomized trial, with one group receiving standard care, another group receiving standard care plus help with our adherence system called U-Sleep. The U-Sleep cohort achieved 83% adherence, whereas the standard care group achieved 73% adherence. The U-Sleep system also produced a 59% reduction in labor, that\u2019s 5-9, 59% reduction in labor for those improved outcomes. This is a validated example of the solutions we bring to our customers to promote not only superior patient outcomes, but also improved customer efficiency and thinking about both the healthcare clinical outcomes and the healthcare economics of the channel. So, finally in conclusion, we remain focused on the long run. Our markets remain under-penetrated and our patient solutions provide symptomatic relief for those on therapy, while slowing the progression of important chronic diseases, while additionally saving money for the entire healthcare system. We have the right solutions. We have the right people. We have the right approach to succeed. We\u2019re confident that we will continue to do so. So, now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brett. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the March quarter was $397.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter, in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 3%. Income from operations for the quarter was $104.7 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $90 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.63 for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the March quarter was 63.3%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to Q3 FY13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing improvements, favorable product mix and favorable currency movements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeting at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $115.1 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 7%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.9% compared to the year ago figure of 28.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 29% for fiscal year 2014. R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.5 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, in constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.4%, compared to the year ago figure of 8.1%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in a diverse product pipeline. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.3% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21.4%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will be in the vicinity of 21%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $216.1 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $181.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $93.9 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other sales were $122.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $118.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 2%. Masks and other sales were $62.9 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1% while masks and other increased by 6%. Cash flow from operations was $101.1 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $17.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $17.2 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.64 million shares for consideration of $72.5 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 19.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $543 million, while at March 31, total assets stood at $2.4 billion and net equity was $1.7 billion. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. Please go ahead. David Stanton : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. I wonder if -- I\u2019ve got two questions, please. Firstly on bundling, we\u2019ve been hearing stories about the fact that there perhaps might be bundling from competitive bidding coming. I\u2019d like some color on that. And then just one for Brett on gross margin going forward, you\u2019ve guided to 61% to 63%. I presume that\u2019s for FY \u201814. Can you give us some color about why the guidance is down for gross margin? Thank you. Mick Farrell : David, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take the first part. I\u2019ll hand the second to Brett. Bundling at CMS, yes, we don\u2019t know where CMS is going with this. They have introduced a discussion item and asking for providers and other physicians in the industry to give feedback. There are two ways to look at this. If CMS does decide to implement bundling, ResMed is not only ready, willing, but also able, to respond to a market like that because we already are in one. In France, we have a bundling model where providers are paid a fixed amount per member, per month to look after patients on sleep apnea therapy. And we work with them. There are certain minima in terms of the number of masks that they have to provide the number of visits, they have to provide the number of tubing, accessories and filters and interaction with the patients. So our assumption is that CMS, if they did go forward, the bundling approach would have such minima in their programs. Looking at it from another angle. There was a recent OIG report that looked at the replenishment rates that are currently there for CMS patients in the U.S. And what it found was for the vast majority of patients they are well under half the maxima requirements by the different category units for existing competitive bidding programs. So we don\u2019t think its way up on the radar. And in response to that OIG report, CMS decided to stay with the current system. So from our perspective, we\u2019d be ready to go with either a bundled model or a not-bundled model. It will be interesting to see where providers land on this but I think that no matter where the market goes, we\u2019ll be prepared to move with it on that front. Brett, do you want to take the second part of the question regarding gross margin? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. On the gross margin front, we sort of ticked down a little bit. And look, it really is a reflection of some of the ASP declines that we\u2019ve seen recently. And I think that had some impact on our margin in Q3. And we just down-ticked a little bit in terms of margin guidance to account for that. And the other factor, I suppose, that\u2019s been helping us out over the last little while has been some FX benefit, particularly with the depreciation in the Aussie dollar. That\u2019s flattened out somewhat now. So those FX benefits, I think, were certainly far less than what we\u2019ve experienced in the past, particularly if you look at it on a sequential basis. So they are kind of those two are the underlying drivers of the slight decline expected in the margin. David Stanton : So -- and just to confirm that\u2019s an overall -- that 61% to 63%, that\u2019s an overall number for the rest of FY \u201814 or \u201814, sorry? Brett Sandercock : Yeah. This is -- as you know, Dave, a lot of moving parts on the margin. So it gets more difficult to predict, but that is, yeah, that is more a Q4 short-term prediction on the margin. David Stanton : Okay. So that\u2019s Q4. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. David Clair : Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one is just on pricing. You mentioned in the commentary that you have done some pricing adjustments. Are these largely done at this point? Mick Farrell : Sure, David. Well, pricing is an interaction between us and our customers on a day-to-day basis. It\u2019s a supply-and-demand interaction that goes on. If you are asking specifically whether the effect of CB2, particularly on our U.S. market, is playing out, then I think the answer is yes. We\u2019re nine months into the play-out of CB2 within the U.S. market and we\u2019re 12 months into when the prices were announced for CB2 in the U.S. market. So clearly, our customers have known about this for 12 months in terms of the new pricing. We\u2019ve been working for them over the last nine months. And I think, clearly, in the last quarter, we sent a strong signal to our customers that we\u2019re here to work with you. But I\u2019d like to make the point that we\u2019re here to work with them on two fronts. We\u2019re here to work with them on pricing and terms, but we\u2019re also here to work with them on business efficiency. So we have the ResMed online store which provides HME partners with an automatic access to order 24/7, 365 from ResMed. We have electronic data interchange, which not only large nationals, but now a number of the regionals are getting involved with. We have EasyCare Online, which is an informatics platform available to all our customers. And many, many more patients every day get connected with EasyCare Online. And our providers find it\u2019s a great way to track adherence, drive adherence and measure outcomes. And finally U-Sleep. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you\u2019ve got a trend 10% increase in adherence and you\u2019ve got the opportunity to lower labor costs by 59% by partnering with ResMed then is it all about $1 on the upfront price or is it about $5 saving in the net present value, over a 12, 24 month time period with the patient? So we\u2019re looking at pricing in multiple variants. David, what was your second question? David Clair : My second question is just -- you described -- it sounds like the U.S. environment is stable to improving. Do you have any metrics you can provide on patient volumes or I guess any color you could provide would be great? Mick Farrell : Yeah, I\u2019ll ask Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to address the U.S. market. Jim Hollingshead : Yeah. I think stable to improving is probably the right way to describe it, David. We don\u2019t have -- as you guys know, on these calls, we don\u2019t have perfect data on underlying market demand. We piece it together, just like you guys did too. What we\u2019re seeing is really decent patient volume growth. Our general sense is that, as CB2 has stabilized and the Medicare contracts have shifted, a number of the accounts that won Medicare -- a number of our customers that won Medicare contracts are actually seeing growth in volume. The customers who lost Medicare contracts have in many cases, gone out and worked on referrals that would allow them to capture commercial pay patients. And so you\u2019re seeing some movement in both directions on that front. We think patient growth remains pretty good, both for new patients and also for resupply. So, overall, that trend is, I think, fairly solid in the U.S. market. David Clair : And then just one last one, if I can sneak it in here. In terms of the AirFit mask launches that are going on right now, do you expect these to carry a price premium to the older masks? Mick Farrell : Well, traditionally, David, we\u2019ve priced our new masks in line with the products that are currently in market. I mean clearly, we all know that reimbursements generally are moving in a downward trajectory. And so we need to be able to take cost out of the system by business efficiency, but then be able to ensure pricing is relatively stable. So in general, we\u2019ve kept pricing in parity with our new masks with those in the market, or very close to. And that\u2019s the plan not only for the P10 as you mentioned, the pillows mask, but also for the AirFit N10, the nasal mask and the AirFit F10. The full trilogy now of AirFit masks are in the market and we\u2019re really excited about their potential. But pricing is going to be pretty much on par. David Clair : Great. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Prior from Bank of America. Please go ahead Matthew Prior : Yeah good morning guys. Just two questions, both in relation to rest of world flow gen, if I can. Mick, just in terms of the strong comments you made in regards to Europe, if I can just ask any color around France in particular, given that change to informatics regulations as of October. What you\u2019ve seen there; whether that\u2019s helped you in terms of patient compliance or the business model? And then secondly, just given the 4% growth number out of rest of world flow gen, that still remains somewhat depressed versus prior year. Can you give us some sense as to whether Japan is still dragging there or ex-Europe, what\u2019s going on in terms of rest of world flow gen? Thanks. Mick Farrell : So, I\u2019ll have a go at the France side. And then I\u2019ll ask Rob Douglas, our President and COO, to talk about Japan. I mean the short answer on France is we don\u2019t break out rest of world, as you know, Matt, into detail. And certainly, we don\u2019t break out Europe and then we don\u2019t break out France on the flow gen front. But I can talk to you qualitatively about what\u2019s happening in France, which is a very important market for us. The head of the group that looks at regulatory approval and pricing for this market for us in France established a differential reimbursement model for devices that have wireless capability and devices that don\u2019t have wireless capability. And it was a planned, sequential, phased differential between the two different types of product categories. That was put into place in October last year and has been running for four months. There have been some court appeals by some patient groups and some folks who were involved in the industry that have slowed down the response on that. And that is still in the court for deciding what is the best approach. From the payer front and from the patient front, we think enabling and liberating the data from the bedside table for the payer, for the patient and for the provider is the best thing. And we think that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to land. Having said that, while this has been in play, we have certainly been able to not only sell our device systems but also our EasyCare Online system, which was ready to go October 1, 2013, when that was put in play. So we are prepared. We\u2019re already working with our home care providers in France to make that work. And we see good signals ahead as that plays out in France. But I want to say that that play is well beyond just the country of France. We think that will apply not only in France and Germany and the U.K., but also across all of Western Europe and has high potential in that space. Rob, do you want to address the Japan question? Rob Douglas : Sure, Matt. Japan remains a lumpy market for us. It\u2019s basically a good market with good reimbursement and really good focus on patient care. But how the -- in terms of specific ordering patterns of our customers and the way their managing their fleet, that type of thing it remains a lumpy market. It hasn\u2019t been a strong quarter for us in Japan. Matthew Prior : Great. Thanks, guys. And if I can just have one more in terms of the U.S., in particular, on CPAP, Mick, you mentioned last quarter that the price competition was particularly focused in the CPAP category. Have you seen that bleed into APAP at all, in terms of discounting pressure? Mick Farrell : Matt, we don\u2019t -- as we said on the last call, we don\u2019t go into details on pricing across the whole category of flow gens and certainly won\u2019t go into details on individual categories. But as a summary statement, pricing impacts have been across the board on categories. And what we\u2019re doing is appropriately pricing across SKUs but across customers, across segments, across geographies for appropriate pricing, to ensure solid volume gain and long-term good revenue growth. And to signal to our customers that we\u2019re therefore doing CB2, but also that we are there for you to drive business efficiency, as well as looking at the upfront pricing. Matthew Prior : Great, understood. Thanks, guys. Mick Farrell : Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from Bruce Du from CBA. Please go ahead. Bruce Du : Yes, can you hear me? Mick Farrell : Yes. You must have been on mute. Bruce Du : Yes. Okay. Great. I just had a question in relation to the masks. And specifically around your experience in terms of the AirFit P10, whether you are predominantly seeing that growth in new patients, or you are seeing actual conversions from existing patients. Given my understanding, obviously, is that historically patients have been quite sticky on masks and you guys obviously would have a benefit if you can convert those patients given the fewer parts in a lot of masks and whatnot. But just could you talk to your experience, in terms of converting the North American patients or whether or not the growth dynamic there is mainly existing versus new patients? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Bruce. Well, you\u2019re right in that. It is quite sticky. Like a great pair of jeans or a pair shoes that you love, patients tend to stick to the existing product, even when they go for the new purchase and that trend has remained. The AirFit P10, which we launched in January, is now in day 90 in the U.S. market. And as we said earlier, is just launching into Europe and Asia-Pacific, as we speak here in Q4. So talking about the U.S. these last 90 days, we\u2019re sort of starting that S-curve of penetration of a fantastic new product. I actually personally use the AirFit P10 every night. I wore it last night. And it is an unobtrusive, light and very comfortable mask. And it\u2019s particularly -- its diffusion of the air is so comfortable for the bed partner, that we do expect great success from it. But we expect that success primarily with the new patients. Bruce Du : Okay. Great. And just I guess, you referenced before the GAO report, just wondering, obviously one of the things that data point showed was quite a significant consolidation in terms of the market share of the four largest distributors. Is that pretty consistent with what you\u2019re seeing in the Round 2 regions thus far as well? Mick Farrell : Bruce, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll get the gist of your question. Can you ask it one more time and then Jim and I will have a go at getting to it? Bruce Du : It was just in relation to I guess the Round 1, the GAO report recently released showed the concentration of market share in the Round I areas of the four largest DMEs in the U.S. had increased quite considerably over the first 12 months of Round I. I was just wondering whether or not you had seen, I guess a similar pattern evolving the Round 2 regions thus far? Mick Farrell : Dave, why don\u2019t you -- David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. David Pendarvis : Sure. So, Bruce, I\u2019m pretty familiar with that report. And obviously, it was based on some early data, Round 2 of competitive bidding, a much bigger chunk of the overall U.S. market. And as Jim was saying earlier, while we\u2019re seeing things play out in terms of market share shifts in the winners for Medicare patients and also in terms of the commercial patients shifting, it\u2019s probably too early to say whether there\u2019s any significant consolidation along the lines that that report found in Medicare, so just early days. You could posit that it would be the case, but we haven\u2019t seen it yet. Bruce Du : Okay. Thank you. Brett Sandercock : Thanks Bruce. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Michael Matson : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I was just curious about -- with your pricing adjustments, the timing of that. I know you discussed it on your last conference call. But that was already a few months into the March quarter. So is that something that started kind of at the very beginning of the calendar year? Or was it something that was kind of done mid-quarter? Because I guess your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter kind of -- fiscal fourth quarter, kind of implies that there\u2019s some additional declines coming in gross margin. So, maybe you could just clarify that for me? Mick Farrell : Yes. So, Mike, the call that we did was actually in January, so we were in month one of Q3 when we made the call. And we said, we were going to appropriately price to ensure volume gains and revenue gains. And also, as I\u2019ve been focusing on this call, about the efficiency gains that we can provide, the solutions we can give to our HME providers. I would say, those discussions happened throughout the quarter. With well north of 4,000 customers in the U.S. and you think, globally, you are in the tens of thousands of customers this is something that happens throughout a daily basis, a weekly basis, as we interact with our customers. So, clearly, the spread is throughout the quarter. Brett\u2019s guidance of $0.61 to $0.63 I think is solid. It takes into account what we have done and have seen and what we expect to see here in Q4. So it all makes sense. And it all makes sense for ensuring we\u2019re appropriately priced, we have got the appropriate terms and we focus on the efficiencies we can provide by talking to customers and providing that value to them. Michael Matson : And just so that I get it clearly here, the bulk of these adjustments are -- have already taken place, as of the end of the March quarter? Is that a fair statement? I know you are always having these discussions, but I guess this was kind of a bigger than normal type of cycle that you went through here so? Mick Farrell : Yes, look, clearly, Mike, there are many factors involved in the supply-demand, our activity, competitive activity, changes in the market. But yeah, as I said earlier, given that we\u2019re 12 months into the pricing of CB2 within the U.S., nine months into the play-out of how it hits the P&L for our U.S. based customers, that being the largest impact change that\u2019s happened on the reimbursement front, I think your assumption is right. The bulk of the impact is there and our guidance going forward is that we\u2019re going to work with our customers to make sure it happens. And we\u2019ll be flexible, based on the needs of the market. Michael Matson : Okay. Thanks. And then just one question on the Astral family of products. Is that a completely new product category that you\u2019re entering? Or is that sort of a redesign of an existing product line that you already had? Mick Farrell : So, I will hand over to Geoff Neilson, our President of the Respiratory Care business. Geoff Neilson : So that\u2019s a completely new life support product platform. And we do have life-support products through our Elisee and VS lines available in rest of world, but we haven\u2019t brought these products to the U.S. market. So this will be a new product line in the U.S. market. We estimate the global market for that product -- the available market for that product to be around $200 million something and evenly split between the U.S. and Europe. So we\u2019ve got that upside for bringing that product to U.S. Michael Matson : Okay. Thanks. And then just one final question on the flow generator business. I know in the past few years you had been seeing a really nice mix shift towards some of the auto setting and bi-levels. And some of that, I guess, was being driven by the move toward home testing. So, are you still seeing that mix shift happening in that part of your business? Mick Farrell : Mike, we are. Home sleep testing, we are tracking very closely. And on a trailing 12-month basis, between 35% and 40% of U.S. diagnosis and these last 12 months were through home sleep testing. With the prior authorization and the focus of insurance companies on this space, the needle continues to tick up on that. And as you look forward the next 6, 12 months, we\u2019ll be looking at 40% to 45%, approaching 50%, of diagnosis in the home sleep testing front in that timeframe. So we think we know that that will start to move up and we know that that will drive a mix shift from CPAP to APAP on a continuing basis. We also think the introduction of products like the Astral with its large $200 million addressable market, globally and then you add all the other respiratory care ventilators that we have in our pipeline and will continue to introduce. There\u2019s a lot of upside on the flow generator front in terms of positive mix shift for us. Michael Matson : All right. Thanks a lot. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Mike. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sean Laaman : Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me, perhaps for Brett; relates to FX. Just if you could give us, Brett, a bit of a guide on the benefits seen in COGS from movements in FX. And secondly, what hedge gains were there, or might there have been in the other income line? Brett Sandercock : Yeah. Sure, Sean. I\u2019ll do it a few different ways. If you just looked at it sequentially Q2 to Q3, we didn\u2019t see any FX benefit at all come through. It was pretty neutral. We\u2019re still getting some of the benefits coming through if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, so that was in the order of 100 basis points year-on-year was benefiting us, but neutral on a sequential basis. So that was the impact there. And then the other part of that question, Sean? Sean Laaman : The hedge gains in the other income line? Brett Sandercock : Yeah, that was in the other income. It was in the order of a few million dollars. Sean Laaman : Perfect. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks, Brett. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead. Ben Andrew : Good afternoon, guys. So, I guess a couple questions for us. Can you give us maybe some other examples of things that suggest to you that the market is stabilizing? Are you seeing promotions decline? Are you seeing kind of quarter-on-quarter pricing changes normalize? Maybe just talk a little bit more about those specific examples in the marketplace. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Ben. I\u2019ll address some and hand to Jim for some other early indicators here. We talked about this at J.P. Morgan and we\u2019ve talked about it since, but we\u2019re seeing primary care physician\u2019s visits start to pick up. We\u2019re seeing referrals from those primary care physicians related to sleep specifically, whether they are referrals to a sleep lab for a PSG, or to home sleep testing, IDTF type models increase. So the needles on both of those are moving up. There\u2019s publicly available data from the payers and there\u2019s some from CMS. And there is some private data that we were able to access from talking to some of the private payers. All of those show the needles are ticking up in terms of patient volumes. So the leading indicators on referrals and on the reimbursement are starting to tick up. And those indicate for us, that the stability in the U.S. market is starting to come back and volume growth is picking up. We also saw volume growth for ourselves during the quarter. We\u2019re not going to go specifically into that because we\u2019re not releasing our ASPs. And so if we give you the volume gains, you\u2019ll be able to reverse calculate that. And we don\u2019t want to do that for competitive reasons. But we know the volumes are starting to stabilize and starting to pick up, not just through the early indicators, but through many interactions we have with our customers. Jim, any more color to add there? Jim Hollingshead : I think it\u2019s a great question, Ben and it\u2019s difficult to point to concrete thing. But I guess I would point to two or three things. The first one is just to reiterate what Mick just said. Volume growth is strong and volume growth was stronger in Q3 than it had been over the previous couple of quarters, I would say. So that\u2019s a good indication. The topic of conversation with our customers is shifting. Every customer is different and there\u2019s thousands of customers that are different size and different business mixes. But the conversations we are having now tend to be more about how do I stabilize my own product mix? How do I do X, Y and Z, to drive profitability? That\u2019s a really different topic of conversation than it was, say, right after rates went into effect. And so you can see our customers have worked through some of the chaos that they faced with reimbursement changes and are now stabilizing their own business models and they\u2019re asking different questions. And we tend to be working with them on things like business efficiency more than we were, say, two quarters ago. And then I\u2019d say, the kind of tone and tenor in the market, just the sort of qualitative feel in the market. This is a very qualitative thing, but I\u2019d say the vibe is a bit better. Nobody is happy about reimbursement rates. None of our customers are and we are not. That continues to be a tough pill to swallow. But the tone and tenor has improved in our conversations with customers and just generally on the market. Ben Andrew : Okay. And then I guess another question of the two, for me would be to Mick. And if you take the gross margin trends, where the currency is at, you\u2019ve given us pretty specific guidance relative to the fourth quarter, if you will of your fiscal year. If we flow that into \u201815, is that stable? Or is that going to take another step lower, because of the move of some currency as we roll that in? Mick Farrell : Yeah, Ben. As you know, there are multiple factors that go into gross margin from COGS reductions, mix shifts and exchanges between the euro and the U.S. dollar, the euro and the Aussie and the U.S. dollar and the Aussie. We\u2019ve been able to achieve some fantastic efficiencies through what we\u2019re doing in our Singapore plant and growing there. We\u2019re doing some great things on the S9 platform in some of the masks that have been out there for a while. But at the same time, we\u2019re introducing new products, which can have an impact on that. Our primary focus is on ensuring topline growth and making sure that goes through. In gross margin, as you saw in this quarter and our guidance for Q4, can be a tool to help us ensure that we continue to have good revenue growth. So, I know, Ben, you are sort of asking me to posit FY \u201815 GM. We don\u2019t do that. We put it out 90 days and we give that guidance of 61% to 63% that Brett just did, because that\u2019s the sort of time horizon that we think we can predict it on, in a useful manner. So, Q4, 61% to 63%. We\u2019re solid with that. And then in 90 days, we\u2019ll get in touch regarding Q1 for FY \u201815. Ben Andrew : Okay. And maybe just another way of looking at that, is the balance of interests here between volume growth ticking back up? Is your share beginning to tick back up, as you\u2019ve made these adjustments to price, or is share really kind of stabilizing? Even just qualitatively on masks and/or generators would be helpful? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Look, I\u2019ll just talk to it generally. I would say our share not only is stabilized, but probably we took a little bit of share when you think about the global scale. And we think that\u2019s the right position for us to be as the market leader. Thanks, Ben. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Hi. Thanks gentlemen. I guess, Mick, to just follow up on the market share comments that you just threw out there. I mean, was that specific -- it sounds like you\u2019ve put in a new pricing strategy here in the U.S. and then had sort an effect on market share shifts. So, specifically in the U.S., did those price changes result in a share gain, say, amongst your large DME customers, Lincare, Apria and Rotech, for instance, or did you see more share gains on smaller customers? Just trying to get a sense of how that played out in the quarter. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Anthony. We don\u2019t go into the detailed share across the categories, certainly not by individual customer type. But qualitatively and generally, looking at the U.S. market specifically, we think -- what we said 90 days ago is that we\u2019re going to appropriately price to ensure that ResMed remains the market leader and ensures providing business efficiency for our customers. We executed on that in the last 90 days and I do think we got some volume share gain. And clearly, there were some price concessions that were a part of that. But more importantly were the hooks we put into our customers for the long-term, which is we\u2019re working with you, we\u2019re partnering with you and we\u2019re going to help you lower your costs. So it\u2019s a high value for you, the patient and ultimately the payer, who will save as we keep these patients out of hospital and in the home. But, no, we won\u2019t go into further detail than that. Anthony Petrone : Sure. No, fair enough. And maybe just with this new pricing strategy within the U.S. and it seems amongst the competitors, I mean, is there a way where to sort of look out and sort of judge timing-wise, where -- not necessarily it\u2019s a floor, but it goes back to where the normal was, which I think, if we go back a couple of years ago, it was normal to see 4% to 5% price declines in the industry. It seems like it\u2019s more than that now, certainly in the U.S. But is there a time where it gets back to normalization? And then just one quick follow-up on CMS audits. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Anthony, so if you look back at the last five, even 10 years, there are step changes and then there are settling, slow gradient changes that have happened in our industry. Clearly, we have had a step change. I\u2019m not going to go into specifics of percentages and year-on-year, as we talked about 90 days ago. That doesn\u2019t make sense for competitive reasons. But qualitatively thinking about it, there are step changes that happened and that has happened. Do we expect that stability after a step change? Yes. Are we working towards that? Yes. Would our customers like it? I actually think yes, because stability in this market, now that CB2 has been digested and planning forward now, which is for how do we get to the $40 million to $60 million Americans, right? We\u2019re talking about the U.S. market, $40 million to $60 million Americans that have sleep disordered breathing. Remember we\u2019ve only got $6 million of them diagnosed and treated. It\u2019s going to happen through stability in the investments in working with primary care physicians; working with patient awareness to drive the patients through to the channel. We\u2019re starting to see that stability, starting to see the needle pop up and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So your third, sneak question there, Anthony, was regard to? Anthony Petrone : Yeah, I apologize. Just we attended Spring Medtrade and there was just this whole focus on CMS audits of DMEs. I\u2019m just wondering if you have an opinion on that and how that just sort of shaking out? Thanks again. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. I\u2019ll hand that to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Yeah, we think that the audit rate and the procedure for audit is a huge burden on our customers. And we would prefer to see Medicare get their act together. Mick Farrell : Fair enough. Thanks, Anthony. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please go ahead. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much guys actually, that was a question I had. That was the hot topic we found at Medtrade, as well. And I guess Jim answered that just in terms of the intensity there, I guess they would the intensity they -- I guess you would expect to grow. I guess what my question was, is anything that impacting sales? And is there anything you can do. I know you\u2019ve spoken to U-Sleep to help with DMEs through that audit process? Mick Farrell : Actually, we\u2019ve seen some stability. Look, I\u2019m not as close to it as Jim, so I\u2019ll let him answer it in a second. From where I\u2019ve seen it and certainly as you look at American Association for Homecare and a lot of the providers now getting on Capitol Hill and working with CMS to understand how to solve this. They are certainly focusing on -- audits are important, because if there\u2019s fraud abuse, you need to catch it and move it out. But you can\u2019t have the one bad apple spoil the whole barrel. And clearly, that\u2019s the message from the providers. And clearly, nine, 12 months into these changes, I think even CMS and the auditors are starting to realize that changing the game and ensuring these patients stay out of hospital is the right thing for the U.S. healthcare system; and particularly, Medicare going through all the changes it\u2019s going through right now and all the patients coming in with the Affordable Care Act. So as we look towards it, we actually see some stability rather than growing of the audits, in terms of how they are looking at it. But, Jim, I don\u2019t know if you have any color there. Jim Hollingshead : So what I would say is we have very little we can do about Medicare and how they\u2019re doing audits. So it\u2019s a burden on our customers because, as you guys know, there\u2019s a big backlog in audits and Medicare is not processing them, in many cases, in a timely fashion. And that hurts our customers\u2019 cash flow, because their payments get held up. And so, it is a hot topic. And it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s a hot topic. We don\u2019t see any measurable, direct impact on sales, because patients come in the door and they need to get set up and DMEs will set them up. But it\u2019s frustrating for us to watch what our customers have to go through in that regulatory environment that is actually not operating efficiently, right. So, I think it\u2019s a positive that there\u2019s a spotlight put on it. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s been raised and I think it has been raised also at the Congressional level. Now it\u2019s gotten some scrutiny and the OIG has looked at it and so on. So, hopefully, there will be a resolution. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to get more intense before it gets better. But, as I said, I think it would be better if Medicare could find a way to relieve that, especially the backlog. It\u2019s completely appropriate for Medicare to be policing what DMEs do, what -- in any space that they are reimbursing and making sure that there\u2019s no fraud and abuse and that patients are being treated appropriately. But to place an extra burden in terms of volume of audits and then not be able to process them within their own guidelines is arguably unfair and needs to be corrected. Mick Farrell : I guess the follow-on there is just from a technology front; is there anything that you can bring to the table I guess going forward that might help them with the informatics and the documentation they need to provide here? Jim Hollingshead : I think we\u2019re looking at a range of solutions that are business process automation solutions. Every flow point, every business flow point for our customers is an area under scrutiny. And with some areas in development, we\u2019re not going to talk about our product roadmap for competitive reasons. Andrew Goodsall : Sure. Mick Farrell : Thanks for your questions, Andrew. Andrew Goodsall : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ian Abbott : Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, just looking at the sequentially -- a question for Brett -- looking at the impact of FX on gross margin, heading into Q4. I know it\u2019s been quite volatile over the last few months. Can you perhaps give a bit of color as to what that impact will be? Brett Sandercock : Yeah. I think going into Q4 -- look, I\u2019d estimate we\u2019re at probably a slight positive for us, probably in the order of 30 basis points on a sequential basis. It will probably eat a little bit. The currency has been jumping around a lot likely; it\u2019s pretty volatile. So I think that you\u2019d probably see a small benefit in Q4. And then on a sequential basis, you kind of lose that, I think, going forward into Q1. But it\u2019s nothing like what we were getting over the 12 months year-on-year period. It is starting to certainly flatten out. Ian Abbott : Okay. And then my second question is on the accounts receivable. That seemed to go up quite significantly during that balanced state. Is there anything driving that? And would you think that would normalize going forward? Brett Sandercock : Revenues are up sequentially and the receivables would be up. If I look at the days sales, that\u2019s pretty much in our -- how we look at it, pretty much in our historical range that we look at, Ian. So it might be an uptick in absolute terms, but I think when you look at DSOs, that it looks in the range. Ian Abbott : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Wheen : Yeah, good morning. And I just wanted to ask about the new product launches that you have. What sort of impact they -- you could expect to see on the gross margin, from perhaps efficiencies in manufacturing processes? Mick Farrell : Well, so, we\u2019ve launched the AirFit P10, the AirFit N10, the AirFit F10, as well as the Astral, so it\u2019s quite a complex set of products to talk to. Rob, do you want to have a go? Robert Douglas : Yes. I mean, again, Steve, we don\u2019t break out all the details of this. But, generally, our policy with our R&D and our product teams is to continually improve products by making them simpler, less parts and better supplier relationships. Obviously, as you introduce new products, you then restart on an experience curve, which you then start putting on continuous improvements onto and that will ramp down. And then as we go up the learning curve, building initial launch volumes and all of that type of thing, it\u2019s quite a complex thing. So there\u2019s many factors at play here. And then net of it is -- the intent of our product program is to drive cost out of the products and keep trying to improve them and make them better in many parameters. And we expect to see that continuing. Steve Wheen : Okay. And just also in the gross margin, we\u2019ve been seeing that - this perhaps is a question for Brett that mix shift advantage from CPAP to APAP. Has that largely run out now, that we\u2019re -- I would say, probably to move into that sort of shift? And are we more, now, just particularly in this quarter, seeing mix shift advantages just because masks will be greater than flow generators? Brett Sandercock : Yes, Steve. I think, look at over the last few years, you can probably -- that shift, or mix shift impact, has probably moderated overtime either time. I think it\u2019s still up and it\u2019s moderated to some extent. But I think some of the other new generation platforms such as Astral and so on -- as we get through that, as we get deeper into FY \u201815, I think some of those will be supportive of product mix and then supportive of gross margin as well. But it\u2019s really early -- as Rob said, it\u2019s really early days in the launch. We have three new mask products. We have the brand-new Astral platform. And we do certainly see, as we work through a lot of the margin expansion initiatives, that we can drive those costs, over the next 12 months as our experience increases on these new products and certainly think we can get some upside there, Whether that plays out in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix, I think there areas there that are certainly providing potential for us in my view. Steve Wheen : And so I guess and more specifically to the quarter, was there quite an advantage, just given that very strong mask growth rate from a mix shift perspective? Brett Sandercock : You know what? If I looked at it -- so if I look at it year-on-year, we still had a strong. If f you like, we still had product mix benefits flowing through and that was meaningful. If you look at it purely sequentially, it was more of much smaller -- it was a much smaller impact. Steve Wheen : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Andrew Hanover : Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrew Hanover in for Joanne Wuensch. I just wanted to ask a couple, or one, strategic question. And that is in relation to Japan and what will it take to get Japan on more steady footing? Mick Farrell : Andrew, I will hand that question to Rob Douglas. Robert Douglas : So, on Japan, it\u2019s a long project for us. It\u2019s always been a lumpy market. And quite frankly, that\u2019s just the way structure -- the way that our customers are structured and the way they run their business. For us, it means it\u2019s a very efficient market. There\u2019s only a small number of customers. They are running these large businesses. It\u2019s good market for us, because we don\u2019t need a large team to service it, but we do have the downside of this lumpiness. So we don\u2019t see that type of structure changing at all. In a sense, some of that lumpiness will continue. Our view of the Japan market is that underlying it, it\u2019s actually still quite underpenetrated. And so our efforts are generally around either providing clinical evidence of the benefit of our products in Japan, or driving demand and patient awareness in the medical system there to drive patients in. That\u2019s got to be offset by relationships with the reimbursement authorities in Japan, so that -- or the funding can all add up to that, as well, But that\u2019s been an ongoing project and we\u2019ll keep on with that strategy. Andrew Hanover : Great. And actually one more question and it\u2019s in relation to diagnostic testing. Back in October, you said that approximately 35% of diagnostic tests were being performed home -- via home sleep testing. And it was supposed get to 40% to 45% in the U.S. over the next 12 months. Just wanted to get a perspective or an update on that. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yeah. So, Andrew, I just said a little earlier in the Q&A that we\u2019re a little north of that 35% from October. We\u2019re now looking at 35% to 40%, so the needle is still moving up. It\u2019s not moving up as fast as it was, but it\u2019s moving up in that sort of 5% increments over those two quarters. As we look forward towards October, at the end of this year, we still think it will be at that 40% to 45% area. And even by the end of the calendar year, that 45% might tick-up a little and start to approach 50%. But it\u2019s payer-by-payer; it\u2019s group-by-group. And it has really been driven by the payer authorities working with their sleep physicians and the home sleep testing as well as the sleep labs, to ensure that patients can get through on therapy. Moving to a scaled one, allowing the mix shift from CPAP to APAP, we see that trend continuing to play out. Jim, do you want to provide some more color? Jim Hollingshead : Yeah, I\u2019d just add a couple of interesting tidbits on that. The first one is that our data show that, right now, roughly 60% of sleep labs are doing home sleep testing. And that\u2019s pretty dramatic movement over the last several months. Many sleep labs were trying to avoid doing home sleep testing, but now roughly 60% are engaged in home sleep testing. And the other thing that\u2019s quite interesting in our dataset with sleep labs -- sleep labs that do actively engage with home sleep testing actually end up doing more overall volume, including in-lab overnight volume. And so both of those things suggest that home sleep testing adoption will continue to move forward. Now that sleep labs are realizing that it\u2019s in their interest to do it as well. Operator : We are now at the one-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks. Mick Farrell : Great. Thanks, John. As always, I\u2019d like to thank all of you on this conference call for your interest and your support of ResMed. Most importantly, I\u2019d like to thank the global ResMed team, providing solutions in over 100 countries, for your focus on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Thank you very much. See you in 90 days. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Larissa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Larissa, and thank you for attending ResMed's live earnings webcast. Joining me on the call today is Mick Farrell, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. We have also posted an updated investor deck, which may be found on the Events and Presentation section of the company's Investor Relations website. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could also cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to everyone who is joining us today as we provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014 results. I'll review the market dynamics, provide an update on product launches and review progress against our Three Horizons growth strategy. Then I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Brett, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. To briefly review the highlights, Q4 revenue was flat on a year-on-year basis and declined 1% excluding currency impacts. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 3% for the quarter to $0.64. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding amortization of intangibles, was $0.66. Our revenue was lower than anticipated during Q4, primarily due to headwinds in our U.S. sales. This was offset by very strong growth in Europe, particularly, as well as in Asia. Before I discuss our Americas results in more detail, I'd like to emphasize that we believe that our performance in the U.S. will improve over the coming fiscal year, and there are 3 reasons for this. One, the U.S. market structure is stabilizing as we anniversary the second round of competitive bidding with patient referral volume starting to grow. Two, the pricing adjustments that we put in place during Q3 will begin and continue to wash through the comparisons. And three, the change in buying behavior that we saw from some U.S. customers in Q4 to move away from end-of-quarter bulk deals to a more consistent ordering pattern should continue. This latter point is good for us in the medium to long term as it steadies the supply chain for our customers, our suppliers and for our global operations team. However, it clearly had a negative short-term impact that we saw in Q4 in the U.S. numbers. In terms of the factors that we control, our ResMed team will continue to execute on our strategy of launching new products, services and solutions that provide exceptional value for our customers. I remain confident in the more than 4,000-strong ResMed team, our global growth and our ability to execute to our long-term strategy. Okay. Let me drill down into our U.S. sales in 2 categories : first, our flow generator category; and second, our masks and accessories category. We have seen continued stabilization in the underlying market trends with patient referrals and growth in volumes and referrals to diagnostic channels in our flow generator category. However, flow generator and the accompanying mask revenues softened at the end of Q4. There were 2 key reasons for this : one, the change in buying behavior that we noted previously in some large U.S. customers; and two, industry rumors circulated during the quarter regarding a predicted launch of a new ResMed sleep flow generator on July 1. There was actually a particular date that was part of the rumor. Since we are past that date, it was clearly a false rumor. In fact, we're 30 days past it. But nevertheless, it caused some customers to hold off on ordering from ResMed during the fourth quarter. Consistent with our past approach to this topic, we have not given a timeline and we do not intend to discuss the details of our plans for our next-generation sleep flow generator platforms. And we are ready -- and when we are ready for full commercial launch, we will issue a press release. And before that, we will talk to our sales team so that they can talk to customers, whether they be physicians, providers or technicians. Looking at the masks and accessories category. Sales were lower in the quarter compared to Q4 2013 due to 3 factors : one, variations in customer-buying behavior, as we just talked about; and two, the continued year-over-year impact of new pricing structures that we introduced during Q3, as we also just talked about; and three, the transition to our new generation of masks, the AirFit series. So as we regain market share and ramp-up on the AirFit series, that is part of the complication. Specifically, we have seen good adoption of our AirFit P10 product in the pillows category since its launch in January. Additionally, we just launched the AirFit N10 and the AirFit F10, respectively, in the nasal and full-face categories during the fourth quarter. So our results for Q4 only include partial quarter sales for those products. We expect that the F10 and the N10 will ramp-up swiftly over the next few quarters, and they have had a very solid start. Physician, HME customer and patient feedback has been excellent on the whole AirFit series : the P10, the N10 and the F10. It's important to note in this mask category that we have a relatively high comparable growth hurdle from Q4 fiscal '13, which was tough to overcome, especially with the brand-new ramp-up of the F10 and the N10. As you may remember from our call last October, we promised to launch 3 new mask systems during the back half of fiscal '14, and we have delivered on that promise. With the global launch now of the AirFit family of masks, ResMed continues to lead in product innovation, particularly in this mask category. We have quieter, lighter, less-obtrusive and easier-to-fit masks than ever before. We expect the mask product categories to perform very well in fiscal '15. On the diagnostics front, we continue to see an increase in home sleep testing, and we expect that trend to continue as sleep labs expand their diagnostic options. North of 60% of sleep labs now offer home sleep testing in addition to polysomnography, and approximately 40% of U.S. diagnoses in the last 12 months were through home sleep testing as insurers and insurance company colleagues continue to drive that trend. Finally, on the Americas. We are seeing strong traction of our healthcare informatics offerings. EasyCare Online continues to expand its reach, and U-Sleep is rapidly increasing its penetration of accounts. U-Sleep's core value proposition is to increase patient adherence while also lowering HME labor costs by up to 60%. In a fast [ph] competitive bidding world, this type of cost reduction and efficiency improvement is a necessity for our home care provider customers. The ability for U-Sleep to text, email and to use interactive voice response, or IVR, has been well received by patients and helps coach them on their treatment journey. The net result is increased adherence, which is good for everyone in the supply chain and the value chain. The bottom line, the improving market conditions, new product flow and informatics solutions should enable us to significantly improve our Americas sales as we move through fiscal year 2015. Moving on now to sales outside of the Americas. Our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions were bright spots in the quarter, especially with respiratory care and cardiology sales. Growth in these regions, particularly strong in Europe, partially offset our Americas performance, bringing us to a flat global headline result. The benefit of having around 50% of our revenue outside the U.S., particularly in tough times like this in the U.S., was well exhibited during fiscal year '14 and especially during Q4. We launched the Astral life support ventilator in Europe and Asia during the quarter. Although it is still very early in the life cycle of the life support ventilator, the Astral has demonstrated very good traction during Q4. Astral is ramping up even faster than we expected, and its value proposition in this platform has been presented to physicians, providers and patients across the regions. Customer demand is growing very rapidly, and we are ramping up our operational ability to deal with that increased demand. We are excited about the prospects for this platform in FY '15 globally. Our gross margins came in at the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter. We continue to manage the key parts of the P&L that are in our control, including initiatives to lower product costs and COGS and to leverage our global manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. Now I'd like to spend some time talking about the progress against our Three Horizons growth strategy. We're continuing to innovate in our First Horizon, which is focused on our core sleep-disorder breathing business. During the fourth quarter, we completed a detailed review and then made changes within our commercial and R&D teams to do 2 things : one, to better align those resources and teams with our strategy; and two, to further increase the efficiency of our overall business and SG&A. Brett will go into further details regarding the restructuring charge we took during Q4 as part of those changes. Additionally in our First Horizon, we have been taking actions to enforce our intellectual property throughout the fiscal year. During the fourth quarter specifically, we incurred significant SG&A legal costs as 2 of those cases went to trial. Those efforts also produced some early wins on the legal front. We don't like to be in court. We prefer to be in the design labs and talking to customers, but we like it even less when we believe our competitors are copying our inventions and infringing our intellectual property. When we are in court, we like to have some battle victories, even if they're a smaller part of a larger campaign. These last few weeks have seen 2 victories for ResMed over a small Taipei-based competitor. The first win was in the U.S. in the International Trade Commission, where the ITC ruled that, despite a redesign of its iCH CPAP device, the Taiwanese device manufacturer continued to infringe ResMed's humidification patents. Also in Germany, we won a permanent injunction against the same manufacturer, prohibiting sales of infringing headgear used on 2 of its mask systems. The judgment was entered by the Regional District Court in Munich, is appealable and covers the entire jurisdiction of Germany. In today's more dynamic and competitive market, we're committed to innovating and providing solutions to our customers while improving patient outcomes and reducing costs for global healthcare systems. We invest 7% to 8% of our revenue back into R&D, and we're choosing to defend that innovation in court to ensure that we can continue to have the ability to innovate and, ultimately, make life better for millions and millions of untreated sleep apnea patients. We're also making progress against our Second Horizon of growth, which includes both the respiratory care market and new geographic market expansion opportunities. With the full product launch of our new Life Support Ventilator, Astral, in both Europe and Asia, we executed against that plan during Q4. Also during the fourth quarter, we received FDA clearance for the Astral for the U.S. market, and we are expecting to execute that launch before the end of this calendar year. On the geographic expansion side, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets, and we had strong growth this quarter in these geographies, particularly in the countries of Brazil, India and China. We intend to remain focused on geographic expansion to drive growth within these countries and also other important emerging markets. Our Third Horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory and other new market opportunities. SERVE-HF, our 1,325-patient clinical trial in heart failure has now been fully enrolled for 15 months. Our partners in SERVE are focused on event-driven data collection in the clinical trial size. We currently expect the first publication from this study during calendar year 2016. As this is a completely blinded trial, we will not know the results until the first part of the study is released late calendar year 2015. We will continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached. During the quarter, I visited Professor Martin Cowie, who is the Cardiologist, Principal Investigator of SERVE-HF based in London at the Brompton. In summary, the clinical trial appears to be running very smoothly from a logistics perspective, which is a very good sign at this stage of a large clinical trial. Also from Europe on the clinical front, there has been some recent encouraging data on the use of noninvasive ventilation and its impacts on mortality for COPD patients. In this study recently published in Lancet, Dr. Thomas K\u00f6hnlein and colleagues found that the long-term use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for patients with hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed a substantial improvement in both survival and quality of life. With the use of effective noninvasive ventilation, 1-year mortality was 12%. This compares to 33% in the control group, leading to a relative mortality reduction of 76%. This is quite an astounding result from the largest study of its kind. This augurs well for future growth of our respiratory care business. During the quarter and for the full year, we have continued to generate strong cash flow, and we maintain our commitment to return that cash to shareholders. We have just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 a share, which represents a 12% increase from the previously declared quarterly dividend of $0.25. This is the second consecutive increase since we began paying a dividend in September 2012. In addition, we ended the year having repurchased 4.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $208 million for the year. We plan to continue with a strong capital management campaign for fiscal year 2015. At a broader level for fiscal year 2015, we are expecting to see top line constant currency revenue growth improvements as we continue to drive innovation with the launch of the new products in both our core sleep and our new and emerging respiratory care markets. The sleep disorder breathing markets remain underpenetrated with continued growth in patient volumes. Clearly, short-term market conditions in the U.S. are tough right now, and we will continue to carefully manage our expenses in that geography while appropriately funding our long-term growth initiatives globally. In the U.S. market, we are seeing the annualization of CB2, which is the biggest round of competitive bidding, and this augurs well for ongoing channel stability and patient volume growth in the U.S. In the Europe and Asian regions, patient volume growth has been strong in Q4, and we expect it to remain so throughout fiscal year 2015. Here at ResMed, we lead the industry with innovative product offerings, and we see ample opportunity to drive revenue growth through solid execution of those new product launches. The solutions will bring value to our customers in FY '15. We will reduce costs for broken healthcare systems that badly need our help and also improve the lives and the quality of life for millions and millions of undiagnosed patients of sleep-disordered breathing, COPD and cardiorespiratory disease. We have exciting plans for fiscal year 2015 with new products, services and solutions. In fact, I would say that we have the most-exciting product pipeline that I have seen in the last 14 years here at ResMed and probably in our 25 years of existence. Our team can't wait to bring that value to customers globally. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett. Brett A. Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the June quarter was $415.2 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, revenue decreased by 1%. At a more detailed level, overall sales in the Americas were $214.9 million, a decrease of 7% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $200.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $99.3 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, reflecting continued pricing pressures in a tough prior year comparable. Masks and other sales were $115.6 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior year quarter, reflecting very competitive environment. We expect an improvement in our mask trajectory in fiscal year 2015, as our recently launched masks continue to gain traction in the market. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $136 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or in constant-currency terms, an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $64.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, and in constant-currency terms, an increase of 4%. Globally, in constant-currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1%, while masks and other decreased by 4%. Before I move to the P&L commentary, I would like to take a moment to walk you through the charges that were excluded in our non-GAAP earnings per share. We have excluded the impacts of the restructuring charge this quarter and the onetime Sydney University charge in the prior year quarter. As a result, non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter was $104.8 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior year quarter. And non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $92 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, was $0.66 for the quarter. Now on a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $87.7 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Gross margin for the June quarter was 62.9%, down sequentially from Q3 FY '14. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin benefited from favorable foreign currency movements, a favorable geographic mix, and manufacturing and supply chain improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. For fiscal year 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $122.2 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 6%, primarily due to higher legal expenses associated with patent litigation. Excluding these legal expenses, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 3% year-over-year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 27.8%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $31.8 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter or 3% in constant-currency terms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials consistent with our strategy. During the quarter, we incurred a restructure charge of $6.3 million, resulting from the reorganization of our commercial and research and development teams, primarily in our Sydney and San Diego locations. The restructure charge included severance payments made to employees. This is a discrete charge, and we've expensed the full amount of $6.3 million in our fourth quarter results. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.4 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.8 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects the tax benefit from the restructure charge and the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rate associated with our Singapore manufacturing operations. Excluding the impact of the restructure charge, our full year effective tax rate was 20.1%, and we currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 will be in the vicinity of 21%. Cash flow from operations was $115.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.5 million, while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $19.8 million. Our share repurchases continue to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares, a consideration of $40.4 million, and we ended fiscal year 2014 having repurchased 4.4 million shares for a total consideration of $208 million. This represented approximately 3.1% of total shares outstanding. At the end of June, we had approximately 18.3 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. In addition to our share repurchases, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. This represents a 12% increase over our previously declared dividend and demonstrates our commitment to delivering shareholder returns through our capital management program. Indeed, as of fiscal year 2014, we returned 110% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to maintain an active share repurchase program in fiscal year 2015. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $605 million. At June 30, total assets stood at $2.4 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Larissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I'm going to assume that you won't [indiscernible] grab the new product. So perhaps, I can just ask the extent to which you think the deferrals impact -- impacted in the quarter in anticipation of that product. And if I can just throw a tricky one in just quickly ask just also the impact of FX on gross margin or masks on -- just what influenced the gross margin increase as well. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll take the first part of the question and, Brett, you'll take the second. Very hard to understand exactly the extent to which the circulating rumors impacted our flow generator sales in the Americas. It was really just in the U.S. and just from a couple of competitors. But it was reasonably broad spread. It wasn't just 1 territory or 2 territories. I know some executives were traveling in the field during the quarter who told me they heard it from every customer, and so it was pretty broad. Understanding the depth of that impact and how it specifically hits our numbers in terms of flow generator growth in Q4 is very hard to say. The good news is that our news from the field is that patient volumes as the channel has stabilized now with the annualization of CB2, that the patient volumes are there. And so, therefore, a missed sale in Q4 should lead to, throughout fiscal '15, as the inventories were quiet and patients continue to come through the channel that we start to get those back. It won't be immediate, but Andrew, I'm sorry, it's just very hard to quantify exactly what the impact of it would be, but it was there. It was probably, slightly material in some aspects in terms of the U.S. sales. Brett, you want to take the second half of the question? Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, sure. Andrew, yes, on FX on gross margin, year-on-year, it was in the order of 150 basis points favorable for us. If you looked at it more on a sequential basis, it was a benefit of around 30 basis points for us. And then currencies where they are just on a -- if you look at Q1 like going forward, it would probably have a -- we'll have a headwind of around, probably, 30 to 40 basis points going into Q1. Yes. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And to what extent do you think your AirFit 10 mask sales picked that margin up as well? Brett A. Sandercock: It's just -- it'd be pretty small, really, Andrew. I mean, they only just came through in the quarter. So really, at the early stages of traction in those new masks. So I think that'll manifest more through FY '15. Operator : The next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : So let's talk about masks in the U.S. And you guys have high market share, obviously, you're a juicy target even with the great new products coming through. This is not a great mask number. What happened there? I mean, because obviously, you're still selling the older mask through the bulk of the quarter, and then the new one is starting to roll out, but what are you seeing competitively there? You mentioned bulk versus kind of regular way, but maybe just give us a little bit more flavor on U.S. masks. Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Ben. So, I mean, there are 3 factors that affected U.S. masks. One, is the variations in customer-buying behavior, right? Moving from a bulk order to a throughout the year type of steady behavior, which is tough short-term better in the long term. Two, there's the impact of the Q3 pricing reductions that we put in place, so they'll need to roll through the comparisons over a 12-month period of time in terms of the pricing impact. And three, there's the impact of the transition to our new masks. We've just launched the N10 in the nasal space and the F10 in the full-face space, literally during the quarter, so you only got a half-quarter of sales or so from those 2 products in the category. So they're the 3 major effects. You mentioned the fourth effect, which is there in terms of the competitive dynamic. And there are some reasonable masks from our competitors. They're not as good as ours, but we do compete out there, and it's a tough market at times, but we think that with the product portfolio that we've just launched, this AirFit series that over FY '15, we have very strong possibilities for not only maintaining but growing share and rising with the market there. Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I guess I'll stick to one follow-up and just ask directly, did pricing get worse in the fourth quarter versus third quarter? Or was it the same? And do you think you gained or lost share in masks in the fourth quarter in the U.S.? Michael J. Farrell: Well, that was technically 2 follow-up questions, Ben. But I think that the price changes that we put into place in Q3 were reasonably effective and, probably, just went broader to more customers during Q4 so relatively stable on the price side from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, on a year-on-year basis, there was a significant price relief for our customers that, of course, we don't quantify now on these calls. To your question about market share, it's very hard by each category to get the details of market share in categories. What I can say is that it's early in the ramp curve of the N10 and F10, so my conjecture would be that the N10 and F10 have a lot more runway to get market share over FY '15. And that if there's any market share gain in Q4, it would have been in the pillows category. If there were any stresses, it would have been in the nasal and full-face category. But that's sort of just based on the timing of those product launches and where they are. And thanks for the 3 questions, Ben. Operator : Our next question is from David Low from Deutsche Bank. David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Mick, could I just start with the [indiscernible], just get you to perhaps talk to us about change. Then, I guess, the question that comes out of that is if you've seen a hit in Q4, presumably, we start to see a benefit, particularly in the first quarter when things are typically a little weaker. Michael J. Farrell: David, you were a little light at the start of that question. Could you repeat the whole question? I couldn't quite hear you. David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Let me try again. So the change in buying patterns that you talked about with major customers, I just want to understand what changed, and then, therefore, what the impact's going to be in the future. Most notably, it seems to me that Q4 is the strong quarter when there is a lot of deals done towards the end of the period. So presumably, we see some benefit from this changed pattern, particularly in Q1. Is that reasonable? Michael J. Farrell: So good question, David, so more granularity on the changing buyer behavior. So what we're referring to is that, sometimes, during the quarters, whether it's Q1, Q2 or Q3, but particularly in Q4, there are larger bulk purchases by, usually, larger customers towards the end of the quarter. And we saw those throughout fiscal year '14, Q1, 2 and 3 but not in Q4. And I mean, the difference between missing or hitting on the U.S. sales could be 3 or 4 deals to sort of make up that difference. And if you think about 4 deals of in that sort of $3 million to $5 million range, you can start to see those types of numbers adding up. The question of why those deals didn't happen in Q4 and why the customers are choosing probably to have a lower inventory stake or a more-efficient operation, I think the answer is that they've all faced the reality now of 12 months of -- in particularly in the U.S. market, 12 months of competitive bidding round 2 impact. And everybody in the space is looking for efficiency, for supply chain efficiency, for ordering efficiency and for making sure that their -- that operations are delivered to patients, but they don't have excess inventory. So I think it was part of that, and it came to a head in Q4. I don't think the wash-through is a 90-day wash-through. I think the wash-through on an inventory supply chain, when you start to look at it as more a 365-day timeframe. It's total conjecture because I don't know the details of the operations of the 5,000 customers in the U.S. or even the top 50 to that great level of detail. But my conversations with top customers in the U.S. are that they're looking for operational efficiency. They're looking to take costs out. For instance, that's why U-Sleep has been so popular not only in Q4 but throughout the whole year because people say if I can increase adherence by 10 percentage points and take labor costs out by 60%, that's the technology I need. So I'll start using then : EDI technologies, just-in-time delivery, dropships to patients. All these types of things are being used by our customers. So there -- that's sort of the summary of that 50,000 feet of changes in buying behavior. And I just don't have the granularity on a 10-, 45-, 90-day scale, but my best guess is that it's a 365-day sort of adjustment that you'd have if you're running a large business on that front. David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just one follow-up then. Brett, the legal cost looks to me like sort of close to $4 million based on the comments you made about growth in SG&A. What should we expect going forward? Are we going to see further legal costs of that magnitude in Q1, Q2? Or is it going to come down? Brett A. Sandercock: I mean, to some extent, it depends on timing of court cases, trials and so on. I mean, there'll be -- you can expect there'll be some continuation of litigation costs through FY '15. I mean, the main thing is we're committed to protecting our patents in the marketplace and our innovation. So we'll continue to do that. And if that means we spend some money on litigation from time to time, then we'll certainly do that. There'll be some come through. It was -- this quarter, we did have a court case, which was kind of happening in that quarter, so it probably popped it a little bit. You could expect some base litigation, I think, will continue for next few quarters. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Hadassin from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just a quick question on U-Sleep if I could. There's been some discussion more recently about the compatibility of some of the other manufactured devices across that platform. Can you just clarify, Mick, whether all manufactured products are still compatible with the U-Sleep product? Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So I think the question is whether U-Sleep is compatible with all manufacturers' products, and the answer is yes. The technology is perfectly capable of taking data from all manufacturers who are able to get data to the cloud that can interface with an API that can be accepted by our product, which is all the major manufacturers' capabilities. So U-Sleep is perfectly technically capable. Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Great. Just a follow-up. So you published that study quite recently, the abstract about the labor cost base. Can you talk to how effective that's been in terms of driving some higher U-Sleep subscriptions? Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Look, without going -- because we don't go into detail of individual customers, but what I can tell you is that, that presentation at the American Thoracic Society from the main stage and then some posters and some follow-up with customers created some great buzz amongst key opinion leader physicians because they see that the world of telemedicine is coming. Digitized data is here to stay, and that efficiency is needed for our global healthcare system. So the key opinion leaders are on board. Specifically, as we talk to customers, particularly in the U.S. with all the price pressures they've had, particularly from CMS, they're really looking, as I said earlier, for efficiency tools. And the data in that study were 59% reduction in total labor costs. And if you're running your P&L and you look at what that reduction on that line is, even if you halve it, say, that was a clinical study, in practice, I'm only going to get half of that. It's a huge potential cost savings for customers. So what we've seen is a lot of customers asking about it. Our territory managers and our corporate account managers are talking to customers about it every day, and we're seeing good uptake from those customers who are doing pilots and trials. Obviously, it's sort of an S curve of penetration for anything, whether it's a mask, a software product or a new platform. But a software platform, when it goes, it can go pretty fast because it's very scalable and it's digital, and that's how it's designed. We're very excited. It's early days, but we're very excited about U-Sleep and the value it can bring to our channel, particularly the providers but also the patients. Patients just love being coached and engaged on their therapy. And moving adherence from 73% to 83%, as was shown in that study, may not sound like much, 10 percentage points, but for 7 out of 10 to 8 out of 10, that's a big needle move when you look at what pharmaceutical compliance rates are in the 50s and 60s at best with all the coaching materials they had. The difference is that we have electromechanical device that we can send data to the cloud, and we can coach that patient on what actually happened not whether we think they took the pill or opened the cap. So we're pretty excited about U-Sleep and its penetration, and we can give updates as we go through FY '15. Operator : The next question is from Eric Fong from Bank of America. Eric Fong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Mick, can I ask for an update on the Japanese market? And as my follow-up, can I confirm whether you are assuming the same level of market discounting in FY '14 as was in FY -- sorry, FY '15 as was in FY '14 in respect of your gross margin guidance? Michael J. Farrell: Sure. Rob, do you want to take the question on Japan, maybe both the questions. Rob? Robert Douglas : Sure. The -- in Japan, as we've constantly said, Japan does stay a lumpy market given the business structure of our few customers there. This quarter, we had a pretty good run at it, and the business goes there. And Japan remains a very, very good market for us with good patient reimbursement and a good opportunity because we think we can still get a lot more patients in that market. In particular, our cardiology products continue to do very well there. Sorry, Eric, your second question on pricing, could you repeat what you said? Eric Fong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It was on gross margin guidance. So are you assuming the same level of market discounting in FY '15 as was in FY '14, the guidance of 61% to 63%? Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Maybe I can take that, Eric. On the gross margin, yes, I mean, we're guiding 61% to 63%. If you look at the price and if you look at it year-on-year, certainly, with the pricing or some of the adjustments we've made in Q3 that'll wash through Q4, and you're seeing that year-on-year impact, that year-on-year impact that will still be with us through, if you like, the first half Q1, Q2. So we'll still see those year-on-year price declines if you like. And then -- but when you look at the second half and a lot of that would sort of anniversary in terms of some of those adjustments. So now we're not going to make any predictions on where pricing might head that far into the future. But think of it at that first half, we got a wash-through. Second half might be kind of more normal with the caveat that, that's going to be unpredictable, really. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I just wanted to get you to clarify that restructuring charge of $6.3 million, where that fits and whether or not there's any likelihood of ongoing restructuring charges going into fiscal '15. Michael J. Farrell: Brett? Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Steven, by where that fits, what do you mean [indiscernible] ? Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So what sort of -- just where -- what line item would we be looking up if we were trying to normalize that. Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, so it would be -- it's a combination around SG&A and R&D, probably a little more skewed on the SG&A side for that if you're thinking about that. And at the moment, I mean, it's important for us to keep looking at making sure we're doing things as efficiently as we can. It's important for us to make sure our resource allocation is really focused on achieving strategic objectives. So we'll do that. But at this -- right at the moment, we've not -- there's no plans on the table for further restructuring. But we need -- yes, we need to continue to make sure we're operating the business as efficiently as we can. Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes, okay. And just back to that comment on Japan, Rob, if -- there was some issue with one particular distributor that had sort of slowed down quite significantly. Have you got any update on the way they're seeing that market and whether or not they're sort of back to sort of full run rate? Robert Douglas : Yes. Look, Steve, we don't really want to break out customer by customer data, and Japan's interesting because there's only a few of them as we said. But pretty well, I'd stick with what I was saying, that the underlying business remains pretty strong. We had talked to some issues around -- similar with other markets around inventory policies and stuff like that, but we think that the business will go forward on a pretty steady basis. And the patient flow's really solid there, so that creates the underlying demand for the products. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Smith from Citigroup. Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : You mentioned in the U.S., the patient volumes are there. Can you give us an estimate of what you think's going on at the market level in terms of market growth rates in terms of volume? Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Alex. I'll hand that question to Jim. James Hollingshead : Yes. Alex, we think that patient growth rates are about in line with where they've been. We haven't seen a big dropoff in patient diagnostics in any way. We don't actually name the percentage growth rate on this call anymore. We stopped doing that a couple of quarters ago, but we haven't seen any measurable decline in patient volumes in the U.S. Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, so really, the dynamics you're seeing are around price and share. You're not really seeing a huge change to underlying demand. Michael J. Farrell: Yes, it's the flow-through of the Q3 price changes. It's the changing in the buying behaviors of customers from more bulk to more steady and some of the channel changes that have happened throughout competitive bidding round 2 that have impacted, all together, those 3 factors have impacted the U.S. growth results there in Q4. Operator : Our next question is from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Two questions really. One is you talk about revenue next year being greater than this year. Could you ballpark what greater means? And then my second question is CMS has introduced a pilot program for bundling products. Could you please comment on that? Michael J. Farrell: Sure. Thanks, Joanne. I'll take the first part, and then Dave Pendarvis can take the second part regarding CMS. Yes, Joanne, we don't give guidance with regard to revenue. We are going to improve. Globally, we're going to improve in the Americas for FY '15 because the macro conditions are going to get better. CB2 is done, which is the largest round of competitive bidding. We're going to wash through the pricing changes from Q3. We're going to work with customers to take waste out, including moving from more bulk to more day-to-day sales as best we can, and we're going to manage that volatility. So with all of that, we know the needle is going to normalize, and we're going to move the needle in the right direction. Dave, you want to take the second part of the question, which is with regard to the CMS pilots that they're looking at? David Pendarvis : Sure, Mick. Yes, thanks, Joanne. The -- it's a little hard to tell at the moment. What we've got is a proposed rule from CMS, which hasn't become a final rule. And the proposed rule itself is proposing pilots in about, I think, it's 16 markets as part of competitive bidding 3. Of course, the timing of the third round of competitive bidding is itself part of a proposed rule. It's not final yet, but assuming all these things go through, it would be sometime in 2016 that they would start piloting in some of the CB3 regions of some form of bundling. We don't know what form that'll take. And depending upon how it goes, we'll, obviously, react to it and help our customers operate with that kind of a model. So it's long ways off, remains to be seen how the final rules come out and then how the pilots come out. But we're familiar with bundling as it operates in different markets throughout the world. So we're confident that we'll be able to work with our customers and work through it as it gets rolled out and look forward to the pilots. Operator : The next question is from David Clair from Piper Jaffray. David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : So the first one I just want to see, is there any way to quantify the change in buying behavior on the U.S. flow gen and mask results? And then if I'm hearing you right, you think that this will take a year to normalize? Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So David, difficult to quantify the exact one, and you're going to need a handful of customers to talk about changing a $3 million to $5 million end of quarter buying to others to have an impact. So we don't -- my answer to the question of how long it will take to wash through that changing in buying behavior, I don't know if it will be a rapid deployment of their sort of efficiency approaches and they can get it done in a 90-, 180-day period, or if it'll be a little bit beyond that. The 365 is the absolute outlier, right, because then it's annualized. It has to be less than that. The answer is we just don't know. It's -- how long is a piece of string on that? So you're asking me to quantify something that I -- it's dependent upon the psychology of the customer, and it's very hard to go. What we're doing with our U.S. customers is partnering with them across the board. Solutions like U-Sleep that we talked about to bring efficiency, products like Astral. When we launched this life support ventilator, which is the first life support ventilator we've ever launched in the U.S. market, during this calendar year, we're going to be bringing to them choice. The first time they've had choice in life support ventilation, and they're screaming for it. And we can't wait to bring that for them. And so we think that will bring some faster orders and maybe some upfront stocking orders as they need to stock, to train their staff and get them up to speed on a great life support ventilator. So there's so many factors, including the new masks and how quickly they roll up and what inventory's needed on those, but understanding the exact inventory policies of even the top 10, 50, 100 customers, let alone, the 5,000 in the U.S., is very difficult. So that's why, David, getting a specific quantification of the days of inventory rolled through on average across the customer base is just very difficult. I was sort of giving you the guardrails between 90 and 360. The answer is I don't know exactly where it'll be within that. David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. And then just as a follow-up here, the reorganization, so what exactly did this entail? Why are you doing it now? And will there be any kind of disruption? Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Jim, you want to take that? James Hollingshead : Yes. Well, I can speak to the Americas reorganization. Really, the way to think about what we did in the Americas was to align with the strategy. And so without getting into great detail, we made some changes and some additions to the sales force in preparation for the launch of Astral. And then we made some changes to align across some business aisles [ph]. So we've done some things to better align the marketing organization and also to create better alignment between sales and marketing. So it was, obviously, a lot of, if you will, effectiveness moves and alignment with strategy there. In doing that, we also took the opportunity to look for efficiencies. Michael J. Farrell: Don Darkin, do you -- Don, do you want to talk a little bit to some of R&D restructuring that we did and how that positions us for the future? Donald Darkin : Yes, so we basically just shifted a few people around to really try and reshape the organization for some of the approaches we're moving into going forward. So apart from some minor reductions in some areas, we've -- we're reshaping and creating some new areas for targeting going forward. Michael J. Farrell: So I mean, look, David, in net, we're talking less than 1% to 2% or around 1% to 2% of our global workforce here, not a huge amount. But it was important for us to refocus our team towards the strategy and to where we need to be in 2015 and towards our Three Horizons growth strategy. And so it was really around aligning our SG&A and aligning our R&D around those long-term strategies and making sure the long-term bets are all accounted for, and some short-term efficiencies can be gained where we no longer need to expand assets and resources. Operator : Our next question is from Bruce Du from CBA. Bruce Du - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division : I just had a question around pricing. I guess it's more specifically to masks. You mentioned that you haven't really seen sort of a change from Q3 to Q4, but you're offering the sort of broader -- discounts more broadly. What are you seeing with regard to the pricing behavior of your competitors in 4Q? Have they changed much at all from Q3 to Q4? And do you anticipate yourselves potentially having to move again? Or has it been relatively stable? Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Look, I think some of the competitive moves were more in Q1 and Q2 from our major competitors in the U.S. market associated around competitive bidding round 2. And our moves in Q3 were a response to maintain our appropriate premium over our competitors in that space, and so it was steady. Predicting what's going to happen in FY '15, I will predict there will be some price competition, but what I predict is when we launch our Astral product, which is the second of its kind, right, it'll be 1 of only 2 players in that market that price will not be the issue. It'll be about efficiency, long-term cost of ownership, the value and efficiency for the customer and the value to the patient of that life support ventilator. In our new masks, where you're able to get first-time fit and easier to fit and easy to use, those values become very important when you're looking at the full P&L of managing your HME business. So price is there, will always be there. Our job and job of our R&D teams, the job of our marketing teams is to produce and then position and then provide through the sales team that value to customers so that they can get the efficiency. And we're going to do that throughout FY '15. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I had a question around your -- on the balance sheet. The days sales outstanding seems to have gone up again, and I was perhaps a little bit surprised to see that go up given you've talked about some -- in absence of sort of end-of-quarter sales. So I just wonder if you can reconcile that for me. Michael J. Farrell: Brett? Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Ian, that's, I mean, in particular in the U.S., there's some longer payment terms, I think, that are out in the market nowadays, really, on competitive response from us. And you'll see -- and obviously, that sort of doesn't manifest straight away but will build up over time. So you're seeing a little bit of that coming through in the days sales outstanding but not really -- it's kind of not really a factor or relation to some of the ordering cycles. It's really something that was put in place a while ago that then starts to manifest in days sales outstanding. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And as a follow-up, could I ask around some of the higher-end products? I'm not sure if you mentioned on the call whether the shift just from CPAP to APAP is still ongoing and also some of the high-end products in the bilevel segment, just how they've performed during the quarter and what the outlook for those is. Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So we alluded to it a little in the prepared remarks. Ian, you're the first question on it. But the home sleep testing is now at 40% when you look at a trailing 12-month period of all U.S. diagnoses, 60% being polysomnography. It's being driven by the insurers and specialty benefits managers and others associated with insurance companies driving that switch, and the channel is responding. When home sleep testing increases, it does almost directly impact the shift that is continuing between CPAP to APAP. And so we're continuing to see the APAP category increasing, and that did continue during the quarter. We didn't see any big major changes in Q4 for bilevel, pretty steady as a sort of -- as a percentage of total sales through there. The impact on all of them was the changing in buying behavior, the pricing and all the macro effects impact across all those segments. But within the individual CPAP versus APAP categories, we are seeing a positive mix shift from CPAP to APAP continuing, bilevels being steady. And as we launch the Astral life support ventilator, we will open up a brand-new category for us at the really highest end of the spectrum in terms of value and margin and value all the way through to the COPD patient, the neuromuscular disease patient that it might treat. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just a little bit, Mick, on the DME ordering patterns. Is there any, maybe, clarity you can give around all those long-term supply agreements where they've committed to purchase commitments? Or are they just in a position now where they're ordering based on their needs? And then one quick follow-up. Michael J. Farrell: All right. I'll hand that to Jim regarding U.S. DME purchasing patterns. James Hollingshead : Yes. I'd -- thanks, Anthony, for the question. This is going to sound like a bit of a clich\u00e9, but every customer is different. And so what we're seeing is a wide range of behaviors. We've got customers who are getting more aggressive about managing their own inventory balances. We have a wide range of different types of agreements. And so it's actually very difficult to characterize in the context and the way you framed it. But I think we can say that we did see, at the end of the quarter, a change in behavior with some of our customers in -- being more reluctant to do larger deals. And I do think that, that is hand-in-hand with some of the anticipation that's out in the market based on the rumor that was spread by one of our competitors that we were launching a product platform imminently. So those 2 things were connected. But it's very, very difficult to say because of the variety of behavior across the customer base. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up for Mick. Is -- previously you spoke on consolidation within the U.S. of DMEs, and that number was sort of in -- close to 8,000 and coming down a bit. You characterized that number lower. So I'm just wondering are we mostly kind of complete with consolidation in your view. Or is there still a little bit more to go? Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Anthony, it's a good question, and it's hard to know the exact answer to it. I mean, we sold to more than 5,000 customers during Q4 just in the U.S. As Rob was talking to earlier, I can count on my right hand, less -- half of it the number of Japanese customers. And so yes, it's north of 5,000. Will there be more consolidation? I will expect some further mergers and acquisitions activity within the DME channel. I think quite a lot of it was pre-CB2 and during CB2. I think now it's almost the survival of the fittest. Those who have got through this year and have still got their cash flow and still got operating businesses and good relationships with referring doctors and good relationships with the patients who are members of their sort of portfolio, that they have the opportunity continue to do that. We're going to partner with all our customers : the small, the mom and pop, the medium regionals, the large regionals and the nationals. And we are helping all of them with efficiency. A lot of the tools we provide, such as U-Sleep, can apply to a customer across that spectrum. So we don't have to be a large customer to use it. Some of the others have sort of electronic data interchange and interfacing with their billing capability. We can do with -- through partnerships with some of the small guys and directly with some of the larger ones. So whatever the opportunity to bring value to all those segments of customers, we're looking at doing it. But to answer your question directly, do we expect further consolidation? Yes. Do we think it'll be dramatic? Probably not. Probably an ongoing quarter-by-quarter consolidation of them without a major step-change. Operator : We are now at the 1-hour mark. I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell: Well, great. In closing, I'd like to thank the more than 4,000 ResMed employees, who sometimes listen to this call, around the world, for their contribution to the world-leading respiratory medical inventions that position us for the future. And we're going to continue to execute against our Three Horizons growth, and we're very excited about the product pipeline that you guys have developed and we get to launch during fiscal year '15. Our global team continues to be more than ever focused on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Agnes? Agnes Lee : Yes.

My name is Larissa, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Larissa, and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast today. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it could be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today\u2019s investor call as we provide an overview of our first quarter fiscal year 2015 results. I\u2019ll provide an update on our new product launches, some key sales highlights and our progress against our Three Horizons strategy. Then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. As we promised during our investor call last quarter, the ResMed team has been focused on executing on our strategy of launching new products, new services and new solutions that provide exceptional value to all key players in our value chain. That includes physicians, providers, payers and most importantly patients. We have delivered exciting offerings that begin to fulfill the promise in our core sleep apnea market with the launch of the Air Solutions ecosystem and its key enabling component, the AirSense 10 platform. We are very pleased with our strong first quarter growth and our overall results. We saw strength across our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, as well as solid growth in the Americas. These results are primarily due to the success of our new product launches in both the sleep disorder breathing and our respiratory care markets, which includes COPD as well as neuromuscular diseases. On a constant currency basis, we grew 6% year-over-year for our global business in Q1. We delivered gross margins of 62.4%, which is right near the middle of our guidance range. We have continued to invest SG&A to promote our new product launches. As you\u2019ve seen from our recent press releases, we have launched products across our portfolio, including sleep apnea, sleep wellness and respiratory care. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.58. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share was a $0.01 higher at $0.59. In the first quarter, we grew at 11% on a constant currency basis across our combined Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. Sales growth came from flow generators associated with our new product launches, as well as masks and accessories. With the launch of the AirSense 10 platform in its early days, we see upside in Europe and Asia-Pac as both the AirSense 10 and our new Astral platforms continue to ramp. In the respiratory care market, our leadership positions and our established channel in Western European countries have allowed us to rapidly grow our business and build good momentum with the launch of our new life-support ventilator, the Astral platform. We expect this momentum to continue solidly in Europe over the coming quarters and fiscal years. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in Asia-Pacific. This quarter we took advantage of opportunities to realign our distribution channels in several Asia-Pac markets, and we have started investing in a dedicated Asia growth initiative with a focus on China and India. We are planning for strong growth from China and India, as well as emerging markets, including Brazil and Eastern Europe during fiscal 2015. Moving on to Americas results, we had a very solid performance this quarter from the region. With the America sales team achieving a 10 percentage point growth turnaround from Q4 to Q1, resulting in 3% growth for the region in Q1 on a year-on-year basis. We are seeing U.S. patient volumes growing in both flow generators and mask categories. We are very pleased with the initial progress of our U.S. flow generator product launches. I\u2019ll talk first about our sleep apnea category product platform, the AirSense 10, and then I\u2019ll talk about our new respiratory care platform, the Astral. We have received very positive feedback from our customers for AirSense 10, and although it is still early days, our sales are ramping up quickly, exceeding our original expectations. As a result of this excess demand, we ended the quarter with a modest backlog for some categories of AirSense 10 devices in the Americas. We are swiftly accelerating our manufacturing and supply chain, and we believe that we will catch our supply curve up to that growing demand curve during this fiscal quarter Q2. In September, we also announced the launch of our new life-support ventilation platform, the Astral, into our U.S. market. The Astral platform has some of the most advanced engineering that ResMed has produced, delivering key advantages for customers such as lower total cost of ownership for HME providers and increased battery life, which means up to 24 hours of freedom for patients. We have received good feedback from our HME customers and our key opinion leader physicians on the Astral product, and we look forward to growing our U.S. life-support ventilation presence with Astral. Moving back to the sleep apnea market, the ongoing product mix shift from CPAP to APAP continues steadily as home sleep testing continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 40% to 45% of diagnoses in the last 12 months in the U.S. were through home sleep testing. Almost every player in the industry from sleep physicians to HME providers expect that private insurance companies will continue to drive this trend above 50% in the near future and beyond. Looking at the masks and accessories categories, our AirFit range of masks had solid volume growth in the quarter. We gained share on a sequential basis. Customer feedback on the P10, N10 and F10 has continued to be excellent. On a sequential basis, volumes were up, and prices were relatively stable in masks. On a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re still annualizing price changes from earlier this calendar year. As a reminder, we are still expecting price to be a negative factor for year-on-year revenue numbers until the quarter ended March 2015. The anniversary of price adjustments that we made earlier this calendar year. Now, I\u2019d like to take a broader longer-term view and spend some time talking about progress against our Three Horizons strategy. In our first horizon of growth, we\u2019re driving engineering and innovation with the launch of our Air Solutions ecosystem and its key component, our AirSense 10 platform. We expect our bilevel range of devices, which we will call the AirCurve 10 platform, to launch in the U.S. by the end of this calendar year and then into other key markets globally thereafter. We\u2019re expanding our digital informatics offerings by increasing the connectivity from our Air Solutions ecosystem to the informatics ecosystems of our customers. In September, we announced the integration of Air Solutions with Fairview Health Services and their Epic electronic health record system. This is just one example of ResMed looking to eliminate non-reimbursed costs from the value chain and to provide increased efficiency and profitability for our customers. We continue to look for opportunities to link our technology to streamline healthcare processes and to drive efficiencies for our partners in the channel. Earlier this week, we announced the availability of the ResMed Data Exchange program, enabling even more customers to integrate sleep and respiratory data into their own software systems. We want to liberate the data. Watch this space for further expansion of our healthcare informatics offerings for our partners, including HME providers, physician practices, hospital systems and beyond. At the Medtrade conference in Atlanta earlier this week, we demonstrated a new personalized therapy management tool, which we call myAir. myAir is delivered through web-based applications that can run on both Apple\u2019s iOS and Android platforms. myAir allows sleep apnea patients to see data about their positive airway pressure therapy and to improve their engagement in their own health care. This patient engagement tool could reduce or potentially eliminate non-reimbursed costs for our HME provider partners and could ultimately support better outcomes for their patients. myAir will be commercially available in the U.S. market next week, and then we will release it to other key markets in the future. We continue to believe that ignorance of the impacts of untrained sleep apnea is our major competitor in our first horizon of growth. So we are focusing even more are focusing even more attention on the importance of sleep quality for good health. In this vein, earlier this month, we launched two important sleep awareness initiatives. First, we launched an education- and product-focused campaign called Better Sleep for Women. As part of this campaign, we created a new website that educates women on how to achieve a better night sleep and to provide a forum for women to discuss their sleep issues. Women are 40% of the patients presenting for sleep diagnostics, and they are well over 50% of the decision-makers in the healthcare space for themselves and their families. This is true across healthcare and particularly in the sleep space. Our new AirSense 10 AutoSet for Her product with its unique patented algorithm designed for female SDB respiratory patterns is a key part of this offering. This is not just great marketing. It is also solid science. This product has been very well received in its early weeks on the market. The second initiative we launched is the world\u2019s first non-contact digital help device, which tracks both sleep quality, including light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep, and the bedroom sleeping environment, including temperature and light levels. The product is called the S+ by ResMed. The S+ by ResMed is a combination of a sleep wellness product and a sleep coaching service that delivers personalized sleep strategies to individuals. The S+ has a patented non-contact sleep sensor technology, as well as sophisticated cloud-based algorithms that are backed by solid sleep science. The data can be reviewed on a dedicated ResMed app, which runs on both Apple\u2019s iOS and Android compatible devices. The app itself is a free download from the cloud. The S+ by ResMed sleep wellness device is priced at $149. We\u2019ve made the S+ plus available in the U.S. market in the future at select Apple stores, as well as Bed Bath and Beyond stores, as well as online for U.S. customers at both Amazon and a dedicated site mysplus.com. That is all one word. The S+ has already been reviewed favorably in the Wall Street Journal, in Time magazine and on Fox television. We believe this tool can help engage some of the hundreds of millions of consumers around the world who have sleep issues and who want a sleep wellness tool to help them sleep better. We believe that it will create meaningful conversations about sleep between consumers and their caregivers and loved ones, as well as with expert clinicians and physicians. On the legal front in the first quarter, we reached a settlement with a small Taiwanese manufacturer called APEX. The agreement met our goals to protect our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and showed ResMed\u2019s strong defense of its intellectual property. We will continue to take actions to enforce our intellectual property and to defend the significant investment of approximately 8% of our revenues that we make into science and engineering within our global R&D team. We are also making progress within our second horizon of growth, which includes both our respiratory care market and new geographic market expansion. We have continued to see solid growth in our European respiratory care business where we have had a leading presence in home care ventilation for a number of years. We expect to grow Astral, and it will build on its momentum from Q4 in Europe as government insurers continue to see the value of moving patients from costly hospitals to economic and more patient-friendly treatment in the home. In September, we launched the Astral life support ventilator platform in the U.S. As I outlined before, we have received good initial feedback from customers. Combining our existing VPAP COPD noninvasive ventilation device and our new Astral life support ventilation device, we now offer our HME provider and pulmonary physician customers the opportunity to provide the right treatment at the right time for both COPD, as well as neuromuscular disease patients. On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets with double-digit growth this quarter. I traveled to our India national sales team meeting this month, and I\u2019ve got to tell you the energy level was palpable. Our country leader there, [Jito] (ph), and our entire India leadership team have an incredible outlook. Their commitment to real-time expanding the future growth targets during a sales meeting is something that I have not seen in over 14 years at ResMed and 20 years in the healthcare and technology industries. We intend to remain focused on geographic diversification with an emphasis on China and India, as well as emerging markets beyond Asia, including Brazil and Eastern Europe. So that in the future these markets become a material contributor for ResMed\u2019s global growth. Our third horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory disease and other new market opportunities. In terms of current contribution, our cardiology products grew strongly in Europe this quarter. Even though it is now 18 months since enrollment was completed on SERVE-HF, we\u2019re still seeing excitement in this space and good partnerships in patient care between cardiology and pulmonary physicians. In terms of other ongoing clinical trials in heart failure, we are currently enrolling patients for our CAT-HF trial at sites across the United States. We expect to complete CAT-HF soon after the SERVE-HF trial data is first published, which we expect to happen during calendar year 2016. CAT-HF is powered to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, whereas SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity with both studies using ResMed\u2019s proprietary, adaptive servo-ventilation technology. We\u2019ll continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached for both of these important clinical trials. It is worth noting that there continues to be clinical interest in positive airway pressure technology as a tool to help reduce the cost of care for cardiac patients. Dr. Richard Schwab and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center published a study last week in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine showing a reduction in hospital readmission rates for cardiac disease patients with adherence sleep apnea treatment. Reduction of hospital readmission rates costs \u2013 helps reduce costs and can help mitigate the reimbursement penalties that hospitals face when Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of a discharge. I talked to a lot of hospital CEOs and CFOs, and they are looking at heart failure and they are looking at COPD patient readmission rates very closely. We know we can help them with technology that includes positive airway pressure and also technology that goes way beyond their future. Finally, on the capital management front, we continue to generate strong cash flow during the quarter, and we have maintained our commitment to return cash to you, our shareholders. We have just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which is a 12% increase from our previous dividend. And during the quarter, we repurchased 835,000 shares at a cost of approximately $43 million. We plan to continue with a very strong capital management strategy throughout fiscal year 2015. Let me close with this. The next 12 months will be very exciting for our global ResMed team as we continue to ramp up the launches of the new products that we discussed here as well as others and new services and new solutions across our Three Horizons of growth. We continue to focus on improving patient quality of life, halting the progression of severe chronic diseases and lowering the costs of highly stressed healthcare systems around the world. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials and then to Q&A. Brett? Brett A. Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the September quarter was $380.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 6%. At a more detailed level, overall sales in the Americas were $207.2 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $173.2 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 11% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $95.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $111.9 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $119 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms also an increase of 15%. Masks and other sales were $54.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior quarter and in constant currency terms a gain in increase of 2%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 12%, while masks and other were flat compared to the prior. Gross margins for the September were 62.4%. On a year -over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 130 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements. Looking forward for the full fiscal year 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. With respect to currency impacts on gross margin going forward, on a sequential basis and assuming current exchange rates, we expect to see a minor negative impact on gross margin as the impact from a weaker euro will be largely offset by the weaker Australian dollar. Finally, we continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $110.5 million, an increase of 9% over the quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 9%, primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with recent product releases, additional headcount to support commercial activities and an increase in variable, employee compensation. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% compared to the year ago figure of28.3%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range 29% for fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $30 million, an increase of 10% over prior quarter and 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental investment in the areas of healthcare informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.9% compared to the year ago figure of 7.7%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to be in the range of 7% to 8% particularly in 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials consistent with our strategy. Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.1 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.4 million. Our effective tax rate for quarter was 18.3%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects a net tax a net tax benefit of $3.2 million, arising from the favorable conclusion of long-running German tax audit. Excluding the impact of this one-time benefit, our effective tax was 21.5%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015, excluding the one time tax benefit will be in the range of 21% to 22%. Net income for the quarter was $83.3 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of 4% over the prior quarter. Excluding the benefit of the one-time tax item noted previously, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.56 consistent with the prior year quarter. Cash flow from operations was %86.5 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $20.7 million and depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $18.6 million. You will have seen we began including the cash flow statement with our earnings release this quarter. Many of you have mentioned it would be helpful to have that with the release, and we plan to continue to include that going forward. Our share repurchases continue to play a significant role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased $835,000 shares for consideration of $42.9 million. At the end of September, we had approximately $17.4 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. We do expect to maintain an active share repurchase program during fiscal year 2015. In addition to our share repurchases, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $506 million and at September 30 total assets were $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.7billion. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn the call over to Q&A, and we ask that everyone remember to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question please. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Larissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Andrew, your line is now unmuted. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair : Good afternoon, guys. So first for us, can you talk a little bit about how quickly the DMEs are responding to the new product features of the AirSense and that connectivity capability? Is it making the sales cycle longer? A little bit more detail there. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Margaret. You know, as we said, the AirSense 10 launch is going very well. It\u2019s exceeding our expectations. We\u2019ve received very positive feedback from our customers. To your question, the discussion around healthcare informatics and its use within the business of the homecare provider is a more detailed conversation and takes a little longer to have that discussion, but we also think it\u2019 that it provides a lo it provides a lot of value to the HME provider. Some of the value to the HME provider can be the fact that with the inbuilt modem, you no longer have to manage a set of SKUs of modems and connect them and manage a fleet of modems all the a fleet of modems all the way through to dealing with customers who have their customers \u2013 the patients who have may have problems with devices that can be instantly checked that the humidifier is working, say, from the HME provider to save that cost of $75 to $100 of driving out to see the patient or the customer tax that comes with the customer coming in. So there are just some of the simple ones. They are obviously a lot more advantages as we look at Air Solutions and the value we can provide with the end to end solution and providing value across the value chain. But even those initial discussions with HME providers do provide a great opportunity to get beyond features and benefits and start talking about end to end solutions. I\u2019ll hand to Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas. Do you have any further detail on the first months of AirSense 10? James Hollingshead : Yeah, sure I would you say a couple of things, Margaret. It\u2019s not cycle devices are doing very, very well. The device is a fantastic device. It\u2019s small. It\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s very easy to set up, etcetera. But there is a sales cycle associated with then using the wide and growing range of solutions from a business process flow point of view for our customers. So the device is selling extremely well and we\u2019re in more and more conversations about how they can take our software solutions and embed those into their business process. Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair : Okay. So maybe they are a little bit longer and so that can start to accelerate and take more shares as we go on throughout the year. But the (indiscernible) go ahead, sorry. James Hollingshead : I just clarified. It\u2019s not taking longer. The devices are selling very well. What then is happening is when then is we are engaged in deeper conversations about using the device to its full effect along with our solutions. So there is some kind associated with that some kind associated with that conversation, and it is almost a solutions consultant conversation that comes on the backend. So the device sales have not slowed down at all. It\u2019s how they apply the solutions into their business that can take some time for them to embed and that part of it is what makes this so sticky. Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair : Got it. And then how much of the growth this quarter beyond the AirSense launch do you think was actually kind of the delayed sales from the man previous quarter that maybe got pushed into this quarter? Thank you. Michael J. Farrell: Yeah, I don\u2019t think, we have a material breakdown of that. There were some S9 that we sold obviously during quarter, a significant component of the sales S9 devices. The AirSense 10 had a rapid ramp faster than we had expected, and a couple of the SKUs, the categories were on backorder at the end of the quarter. I\u2019m not sure, Brett, if we have a breakdown of any material change from Q4 to Q1 then. Brett, do you want to make any comments there? Brett A. Sandercock: No, I think that\u2019s right, Mick. It would be hard to really know, if there was an impact what that impact would be. Certainly though when you look at AirSense and how it\u2019s gone the first two months, it\u2019s gone very well. But yes, I don\u2019t think we have tease out that impact. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Margaret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS: Thanks very much for taking the question. I\u2019m sorry my phone had dropped out \u2013 maybe a bit repetitive. But actually I thought I might ask you quickly just on the launch of the bi-level range, just where you\u2019re at with that. Does that appear in the inventory build and whether you have had any effect in the quarter by not having that product out there? Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Andrew, and good that your phone is working now. The bi-level products which we which we are calling the are calling the AirCurve 10, we did show at the Medtrade conference earlier this week in our U.S. market, and we will launch the AirCurve 10 before the end of the calendar year. So they are out there in the public environment. Given the competitive environment, we are not going to give the date or the level of inventory that we have or do not have of AirCurve 10 within our factories or our distribution warehouse. So it just doesn\u2019t make sense to go into that level of detail. But I can tell you, I\u2019ll stand behind what we showed at the conference and what we said at the AirCurve 10 will provide fantastic value. It will be part of the Air Solutions ecosystem, and we look forward to launching it in our U.S. market before the end of the calendar year. Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS: And I guess last time with the launch with the delays, obviously it was a prolonged delay last time. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s any small levels of deferral that you\u2019ll experience between now and then? Michael J. Farrell: You know, Andrew, given that we will be launching the AirCurve 10 within three months of the AirSense 10, we don\u2019t expect any dramatic holdovers on the bi-levels like we had from the S8 to S9 or the S9 to S9 bi-level timings. As you remember, those were more of the order of 24 months and 36 months respectively. So, we are talking three months. Any impact may have happened in Q1 where we had the Airsense 10 products and the CPAPs and APAPs but not the bi-levels. The bi-levels were still on the S9 platform. But we think it\u2019s relatively de-minimums, and we think going forward that the full value proposition we will have by the end of Q2 will be in the market, and we shouldn\u2019t be materially affected by that. Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS: Okay. That\u2019s terrific. Thanks very much, and I\u2019ll get back in queue. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Andrew. Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS: Thanks. Operator : Thank you and your next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan: I just had a quick question for Brett on the currency effect on the gross margin for the current quarter. At the last quarter, you highlighted that there might be a small headwind. Are you able to quantify it? And then just talk to what sort of benefit we may have seen from the weakening of dollar and going into subsequent quarters. I take your point about the euro, but just if we could provide (inaudible) on that, relativity (inaudible) that would be useful. Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, sure, Steve. Yes, if you look at our margin sequentially through Q4 to Q1, there was a currency headwind. It was around 50 basis points. So that certainly did impact our gross margin when you looked at it sequentially. If you look forward Q1 to Q2, we certainly have a headwind from the weaker euro, which is impacting revenues and then margin. If you look at that \u2013 I think, we that, we get a small headwind, it will probably I suspect be around the 40 basis point marks for that. As you know, the only dollar benefit tends to lag by a quarter or so. So more of that benefit would then flow through into Q3, we are infecting Q3; I think on a sequential basis, we get some more upside from currency because of the weaker Aussie. So that sort of plays out like that Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan: Yeah, that\u2019s very useful. And then just separately a quick question on Japan. Been waiting for some \u2013 it has obviously been a market that has been a little bit disruptive over recent quarters. Could you just give some update as to what might be happening there? Brett A. Sandercock: Rob, our President and Chief Operating Officer will answer that. Robert Douglas : Yes, thanks, Steve. So the fundamentals of the Japan market haven\u2019t changed dramatically. We still have a good patient flow. We still got a really good business with our cardiology product, and we\u2019re seeing strong product flow there. Because of the structure of the way we go to market, these are lumpy businesses it reflects in our sales. And this quarter we had a positive result from that lumpiness. But we will continue to see that lumpiness through there and we will have positive strong quarters, and that\u2019ll be offset periodically. It\u2019s pretty well going pretty well. Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan: Right, thanks very much. Brett A. Sandercock: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thanks very much. I was wondering if we could just touch on mask sales. So the numbers or the growth rate is relatively weak there and particularly in light of the fact that there\u2019s a number of new products being launched. Could you talk to what\u2019s causing the weakness with that new product range being out? Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, David. Yeah I will mention three things and then maybe hand Don Darkin, President of our SDB business, to talk after that. First point, we saw volume growth in the quarter sequentially increase, and we expect that to continue as we ramp up. So we saw a sequential increase in volume from Q4 to Q1. Masks were down. Second quarter masks were down in Q1 on a year-on-year basis due to the lower prices that were washing through from the sort of January to March 2014 quarter that will happen January to March 2015 quarter. And so we are still expecting that to wash through on that time horizon. But the third point is we have seen really good traction of the AirFit range from the P10, which I personally wear and have been for a number of months, the N10 and the F10 and the growing share sequentially and the anecdotal feedback from customers is they really like those masks. So I think that augers well for us as we look to future volume growth and then future revenue growth as we look to our end of Q3 and Q4. David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks. So you would classify that as \u2013 not off on share. It is more around price than it is share loss. Michael J. Farrell: I\u2019d actually say we took share, David, from Q4 to Q1 on a sequential basis and that the year-on-year numbers you are looking at obviously we are watching through the price changes that have happened there. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d nuance that. David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thanks, Mick, and just maybe one for you, Brett, just on gross margins. You talked about there being a negative mix effect in there. Could you just touch on that whether you\u2019re talking geographic or products, please? Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, that would be on the product side, Dave, and it\u2019s really that as you saw the kind of flow generator growth relative to the mask growth was the big driver there. David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank : So would it not be right to say that geographically there was a positive mix effect? Brett A. Sandercock: Yeah, if you look at year on year, yes, correct. But fairly \u2013 pretty small, pretty small. David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank : All right. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks very much. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, David. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse. Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks, good morning. First question maybe just for Brett. Brett, operating cash flow was actually down on the PCP. Earnings were up slightly. Can you just talk to what the drivers of that was? Is it receivable days that have increased on a PCP basis? Brett A. Sandercock: Yeah, that would be. Yes, these are around some modest increases in working capital on a relative basis. The receivables DSOs is little higher, and probably the other driver there would be some inventory build as well. So they are playing out with a modest increase in working capital, which has lowered cash flow a little bit. Having said that, I still think the $86.5 million is still pretty strong cash. Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse : Sure. Okay and just a separate question for Mick. Mick, October saw the introduction of the CMS penalties to hospitals with readmission rates, one of them being COPD. Are you starting to have any increased dialogue where engagement with those hospitals with regards to use of bi-levels in particular for management of COPD in the home? Michael J. Farrell: Saul, that\u2019s a great question and actually leads into something I had in the prepared remarks, but COPD and heart failure together are two of the top readmission disease states for hospitals CEOs and CFOs as they look at this in the U.S. And yes, currently it\u2019s around a 30-day readmission cycle. And the penalties are significant and they go across the whole Medicare CMS reimbursement for that hospital. So this is real money that you\u2019re looking at. You have to be above the million, above the 50% mark for hospitals across the United States to not get a penalty. So it\u2019s a competitive game that gets more competitive as everyone gets better. We are certainly partnering with our hospital customers and our DME providers to make sure there is a strong hospital to home transition for those patients with COPD. The opportunity is twofold. It goes beyond just bilevel. The opportunity is our VPAP COPD, which is the bilevel noninvasive ventilation device and it\u2019s also for the Astral for the Astral, which is a life support ventilation device that can be used for both COPD and neuromuscular disease patients. So there\u2019s a right solution for the right patient at the right time that the hospital and the HME provider can get. And so we are partnering with discharge planners and hospital systems across the country. And frankly in the new world of ACOs, accountable care organizations, where hospitals and primary care now share per member per month budgets, we think the time is right to move we think the time is right to move on this, and we should see progress on this over the coming quarters and fiscal year because this is a long development cycle but again has stickiness as you look to that long term. Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the David Clair from Piper Jaffray. David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one for me, you guys have been very active on the informatics development recently. Can you just remind us how are these initiatives going to translate into revenue for ResMed? Michael J. Farrell: Well, that\u2019s a great question, David, and I will hand the second part of Don Darkin, the President of our SDB business. But the informatics investment is a major one for us. As you can see with Air Solutions, which comprises both AirView, which is the combination of our EasyCare online, well as U-Sleep, as well as now myAir. You\u2019ve variety of applications that are primarily cloud based and can interface with HME providers, hospitals and also with U-Sleep to coach patients. These are major investments, and the way in which this connects through to revenue is that as for instance take one of the plays in the channel, an HME provider realizes they can save non-reimbursed costs by drive outs, pickups and no-fault balance with devices, they will want to adopt this new technology. And as they see its capabilities on that front, they will realize the value that they value that they get is far above the price that we are charging them for access to data points. And for us, taking weight out of the system and providing investment to get some return from that is also a positive economic argument. So it works for us, and it works for our HME providers. If you take another example the Epic hospital integrations with Fairview, not only is the HME providers that are involved there getting the benefit of reducing non-reimbursed costs, but the hospital system that is looking to manage say the COPD readmits or say their accountable care organization, total economic or total cost of ownership or total patient management approach, they can find both a clinical and economic value out of that And that should for us lead to more share and more stickiness with those hospitals, HME providers, patients throughout the value chain. Don, anything to add beyond that regarding our healthcare informatics investments and any connection to revenue. Donald Darkin : Yes, David, the broader issue here would be to look at it, like a Kindle. If you think about how people will select the best conditions for whether they are a large HME or a small HME in running too many realizations of revenue from troubleshooting. You want to roll the truck to check if whether unit is working or not. You will be looking at share shift on big customers to who want to get more units into that solution into end. The compliance programs will drive more usage, usage, better outcomes for the patient, better outcomes for the HME. This will also then drive programs for accessories, which will again increase better patient compliance and a better business for the HME. So there\u2019s a multitude of areas here notwithstanding the actual costs coming out of the actual value chain and increasing profitability for the customers as well. And they are all on top of any sort of flat fees that may be paid for purely phone usage either way. So it\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. It will reflect itself in many, many ways, in many, many countries. David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Thanks for the answer, guys. Just a quick one on emerging markets for my follow-up. I\u2019m just curious are you planning on selling the same products in emerging markets or you\u2019re going to be launching low cost, low wear cost alternatives? Michael J. Farrell: David, great question. I\u2019ll hand that to Rob Douglas Robert Douglas : Thanks, David. So the emerging markets have got quite lot of different dynamics in them. Each one of them is complex as any of the other markets. Some of them are actually high price markets and some of them are lower price markets. And then they\u2019ve got different medical reimbursement schemes and different system. So it is less focused on compliance management than in developed countries. And so in some markets the value of proposition of the telecoms in the device will be different. And so, in a sense really what we\u2019re going to do is go market by market, and configure products that are appropriate for them and we\u2019ve got a platform solution that lets us do that very effectively. David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Thank you. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks for your questions David. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Bruce Du from CBA. Bruce Du \u2013 CBA: Hi guys. Just two questions for me. Just to clarify, so in terms of the timing for SERVE-HF, I think you mentioned the initial results would be in calendar year 2016. Has that time table been pulled back a little bit? Michael J. Farrell: No Bruce. We\u2019ve always say that the final patient the power around the study. It\u2019s an even driven trial so, we don\u2019t know the exact date but the based on the power analysis and the even rate, that we have predicted the formal patient should hit the two year mark from initial setup some time in 2015. Then the primary investigators have to collect the data, analyze the data, create a peer view publication, go through the peer view prices and then get published so that they can present it ACC or HFSA or AHA. And so that process will result in a first publication and presentation sometime in calendar year 2016. I\u2019d like to make the point, that there will be multiple publications that come from this study. And this is just the first publication that we think it will be a seminal one. That\u2019ll come out during calendar year 2016. Bruce Du \u2013 CBA: Okay. Great. Thanks. And just the second one was around the Astral in the US. Could you perhaps give us a bit of color in terms of the degree of I guess understanding and sophistication by DMEs around the product given it is a relatively new product for you? Does that imply a relatively slower ramp up? Michael J. Farrell: So there will be a slower ramp up of the Astral product in the U.S. market. These of the our European market, because in Europe we played in home life support ventilation for the last seven years. Since our (inaudible) longer than eight years since our acquisition of Saime. In the U.S. market, we are developing our channel with our risk free account managers and interfaces between them in our territory mangers in through our U.S. channel. I can tell you, we\u2019ve been ramping up that team over the last 6 to 12 months. We trained them very well at the America\u2019s sales meeting a couple of months ago and they will be and they will be and are talking to customers on a day-to-day basis already in the market. The customers have used a similar product from competing companies and so there are number of HME providers who are well versed in using home life support ventilation. So the customer education is not the issue and the customer is actually would like other supplies based on our initial conversations and we think that the value we provide with the lower total cost of ownership, increased freedom for patients, increased ease-of-use and increased maintenance and capability of these devices for both the patient and the provider that there\u2019s a very good value proposition. But if you like, there will be a faster ramp-up of the S-curve of penetration in western Europe versus for the United States. Use of the Americas. In Canada and Latin America, the ramp will be faster more home ventilation supported markets there where we\u2019ve been selling products already from our existing portfolio there. David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Market. Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrew Hanover in for Joanne Wuensch. I had two questions for Brett, but I wanted to start off with the first more strategic one for Mick just as a follow-up to the last question as it relates to the sales force for Astral. And you know do you believe that you have the right size sales force right now, or are you expecting to increase or decrease it? Michael J. Farrell: So I\u2019ll take the first take the first half of that question, Andrew, and then I\u2019ll hand the second half of it to Jim to talk about the readiness. Our sales teams globally are very ready for Astro and particularly in France, Germany, and the UK all of the Nordics in many countries in Asia, including Japan, are not limited to it. The teams are very well versed in life support ventilation and home ventilation, and we have an existing number one or number two market share in home ventilation in most of western Europe. So I believe the skids are greased for those country markets. Similarly for Canada and Brazil within the Americas. Within the United States, we are ramping up that team as I discussed. Jim, do you want to add any further detail to that ramp-up to answer Andrew\u2019s question. James Hollingshead : Yes, sure. We\u2019re not starting from scratch just right now. The team has been in place for a while, and we are adding incrementally to it. I think we have the right level of coverage, and I think we\u2019re fine. Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Great. And for Brett, just two quick ones. How much was FX \u2013 how much did FX help or hurt EPS this quarter? Brett A. Sandercock: Actually, Andrew, it was pretty much flat. No actual impact year on year this quarter. Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Great. And then as it relates to flow generators, flow generators were up 12% quarter in the quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year, they were up 1%. I was just trying to understand how we think about demand for the remainder of the year, and thanks for taking our questions. Michael J. Farrell: The demand for the rest of the year? Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Trend for the rest of the year, just so we get a good understanding. Brett A. Sandercock: Well, the trends on that on the flow gens are probably \u2013 probably like Mick talk about it, it is not something we give out in any sort of detailed guidance or anything. Michael J. Farrell: Now, Brett, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re not going to go into detailed guidance on that. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, about Asia. You mentioned you\u2019d in-sourced a number of distribution channels, including in Australia. Just wondering sort of outside Americas, how much do you now distribute directly, and how much is through distributors and where do you see the split moving? Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Ian, we have different models in all the different countries we are in, and we adjust it based upon the needs within those countries. So we sell or distribute within 100 countries, and there are very different models in all of them. For the vast majority of our revenues, we partner with home care providers and HME providers such as in the U.S. and France and in markets where there aren\u2019t government reimbursement. In others we have different models that apply. Our goal in all this from a strategic perspective is to think about the best needs for the health care system and the best needs for the patient and the best needs for everyone in the value chain. And what we\u2019re finding is that the solutions that we can bring to the market have applicability in each of those different country areas. And so I think Rob described it really well earlier that we customize our value prop from a platform that\u2019s flexible country by country, region by region, and frankly even within country reimbursement group by reimbursement group. Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great. And then if I could perhaps ask about the AirSense 10. Do you have sort of any \u2013 I know you\u2019re one step removed, but do you have any sense if it\u2019s driving any upgrades? Are you seeing existing patients actually coming in and asking for the new model, or is it mainly still new patients? Michael J. Farrell: So, Ian, we don\u2019t have knowledge to that level of granularity to know at the patient level who is getting the new device set up. Certainly within our U.S. environment, the HME providers that have started to order and use the AirSense 10 have been very pleased and delighted with the product. Its ease of setup. It\u2019s small. It\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s all integrated. There\u2019s no SKUs to manage, so we\u2019re seeing great benefit from that. On the patient side, there are a lot of patient benefits about being small and quiet and comfortable and having the ability to seamlessly have their data shared with their doctor so that they don\u2019t have to drive in for doctor visits. I think a particular aspect of patient engagement that\u2019s important is a product that may not have hit much on your radar, but it\u2019s called myAir. It\u2019s a patient engagement solution that allows patients to directly interact with their data. We have a system called HALO, which is an acronym that stands for Hour After Last Off. So when the patient takes off the mask, let\u2019s say, it\u2019 s 6 :30 AM, by 7 :30 AM their data is available in the cloud and then the HME provider, or the doctor, when they turn up at their office, can have those data in virtually real-time. Similarly, if the HME provider and the patient think it makes sense, the patient can go on their own app on myAir and see their own data. And there can be coaching, there can be feedback, and taking away non-reimbursed costs for the HME provider and potentially improving outcomes and certainly reducing costs for the channel within that system. So we think there are so many advantages of the Air Solutions platform for patients that it will be very engaging. But given we are only two months in, it\u2019s hard to really piece out what is channel demand from HME providers, channel demand from physicians who like features such as the AutoSet for Her, which is an algorithm specifically designed for women or features that, as you indicated, our patients may like myAir. Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Ian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. David Stanton \u2013 CLSA: Thanks very much for taking my questions and good afternoon. I wonder if you could give us some more color in terms of the numbers around whether the use of the AirSense 10 versus other products leads to a lower setup in maintenance costs for a U.S. DME and a patient. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell: David, we have some data that we presented at the American Thoracic Society conference in May this year, and it\u2019s related to the AirSense 10\u2019s automated informatics capability. And it was a presentation about a technology called U-Sleep, which an HME provider can use, and it provides information via email, text or even interactive voice response. So direct voice to patients that coaches them through the sort of 3-, 7-, 14-, 30-day process and beyond to 365 days and beyond them. And those data from that presentation showed that the costs for an HME can be reduced by up to 59%. That\u2019s 59%. And the adherence had a trend to improvement that went from 73% adherence to 83% adherence. And that may not sound like a whole lot, but 10 percentage points improvement of adherence for a payer system that\u2019s managing a portfolio of patients or an HME provider that\u2019s looking at costs in a tough P&L environment for them could be quite a material contributor to the savings of both those groups. And more importantly for the patients themselves, it means they\u2019re going to stick to this therapy, which is going to help them improve their long-term outcomes. So we think in terms of color for the AirSense 10 that the improvements are quantifiable, and our customers will start to see them and quantify them in their own way with their own systems as it rolls out over the coming quarters and months and years. David Stanton \u2013 CLSA: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And I wonder if you\u2019d make a comment in terms of period end discounting, how you characterize the market in recent periods compared to perhaps a year or so ago? Thank you. Michael J. Farrell: David, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll hand that one to Jim, and I think it\u2019s the end of our Q&A after that. James Hollingshead : Yeah. David, I would say we haven\u2019t seen anything unusual this quarter, and I think for a long time our sales have been \u2013 in the quarter have been sort of backend weighted. But we didn\u2019t see anything substantially different this quarter as we have over the past several periods. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks for your questions, David. David Stanton \u2013 CLSA: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We are now at the one-hour mark, so I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Larissa. I\u2019d like to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed teams from around the world for their contribution to our recent product launches. Your innovative engineering solutions are changing the game for customers in over 100 countries, helping them improve patient quality of life, helping them reduce the cost burden of chronic disease and helping them improve the delivery of respiratory health care. We remain focused on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Thank you and we\u2019ll talk to you again in 90 days. Agnes Lee : So this concludes our first quarter earnings live webcast. If there\u2019s any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at resmed.com. Thank you again for joining us today. Larissa, you can close the call now. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes this conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Ellen, and thank you everyone for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders, who are joining us on today's investor call, as we provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we achieved very strong sales growth this quarter with excellent progress from new product launches in our core market of sleep disordered breathing, as well as our cardio and respiratory care markets. In the introductory remarks, I'll discuss our sales achievements; I'll also provide an update on our product launches; and finally, I'll cover progress against our longer-term three horizons growth strategy. Then, I'll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. As you saw in our press release, our global business achieved double-digit revenue growth in Q2 or 14% on a constant currency basis. Including currency headwinds, our global growth was 10% year-on-year. We saw strength across all geographic regions, with robust double-digit growth in the Americas as well as double-digit growth in our combined European and Asia-Pac regions on a constant currency basis. These results were fueled by the success of new product launches in our sleep apnea and respiratory care markets, including both COPD and neuromuscular disease. We delivered gross margin of 62.2%, which was just above the middle of our guidance range for the quarter. At the same time, we continue to invest SG&A to promote our global product launches. As a percentage of sales, SG&A remained roughly in line on a year-over-year basis at 29% of sales. We also continued to invest in research and development, as we continue to innovate to build long-term, sustainable, competitive advantage in the marketplace. R&D represented about 7% of revenues, which is slightly down from prior quarters, primarily as a result of currency movements, particularly in the Australian dollar. Looking at the bottomline, our GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 7% to $0.64. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS was a $0.01 higher at $0.65. Zooming in on our combined European and Asia-Pac businesses, we grew at 16% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. Including currency headwinds, we achieved 8% headline growth for our combined European and Asia-Pac business units. This robust sales performance came from the balance of flow generator growth, associated with our new product launches, as well as strong growth in masks and accessories in the region. With long multi-year product lifecycles for new device platforms, our flow generator launches are still in their early days. We see upside in Europe and Asia-Pac for both the AirSense 10 and the Astral platforms, as we look forward. We have seen strong early interest in our Air Solutions platform in Europe, and we will continue to invest and grow that opportunity overtime. It is important to note that the digitization of medicine in the respiratory space is becoming a truly global trend. And it's a trend that ResMed is leading. Zooming out to a higher level, we believe that noninvasive homecare ventilation solutions combined with robust healthcare informatics solutions will be critical to improving patient outcomes and lowering costs for COPD and heart failure patients within global healthcare systems. This is an important macro trend and we will continue to partner with patients, physicians, hospitals, homecare providers, payers and governments to help solve the chronic disease problem. We see a significant unmet medical need and a huge opportunity. We are rapidly growing the European respiratory care market. Our established channels in Western European countries have helped us to build good momentum over the last eight months with the launch of our new life support ventilator, the Astral platform in the region. In addition, during the second quarter, we continue to invest for longer-term growth in Asia-Pacific. We are investing in both respiratory care and sleep apnea channel development to help create and lead both sleep apnea and home ventilation markets in Asia-Pac, with a focus on the significant growth opportunity potential in both China and India. Moving on to Americas results, we had a strong performance in Q2 from the region, with the Americas sales team driving 12% year-on-year growth. We have both good momentum and high morale within the team, as our innovative solutions meet and beat customer needs. We are particularly pleased with initial progress of our U.S. flow generator product launches with 25% year-on-year growth for that category in the Americas region. Let me drill into the U.S. flow generator category in some detail and talk about three key product launches, the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10, and then our new respiratory care platform, the Astral. When talking about the AirSense 10, we have to discuss the Air Solutions Healthcare Informatics ecosystem that surrounds it. One of the key reasons the AirSense 10 product has exceeded our expectations is the value provided by Air Solutions. We continue to hear positive feedback from customers about this end-to-end solution, including its quantifiable benefit for patients, providers, physicians and even payers and hospitals. We are still in early days for Air Solutions and we will continue to enhance its offerings, but all indicators point to the fact that we have a winning value proposition. We are providing an opportunity to drive more efficiency, to increase adherence and to improve patient care, all by liberating data and empowering all players in the value chain. AirView, U-Sleep and myAir are just some of the key components of the Air Solutions ecosystem. As you may remember, we ended last quarter with a backlog on the AirSense 10. This quarter, I am happy to report that our operational excellence went into play, and we've been able to swiftly ramp up our supply chain and manufacturing system to make demand. We are still working through each detail production combination to get ahead of demand and build out appropriate levels of safety stock. But it is important to note that any remaining product backlogs are immaterial to the business. The second U.S. flow generator subcategory I want to discuss is the AirCurve 10, which is the bilevel group. As expected, we launched the AirCurve 10 in the U.S. in December, the final month of the quarter. And we are receiving good early customer feedback. The AirCurve 10 devices are an integral part of the Air Solutions platform that I mentioned earlier. So this, the AirCurve 10, is a cloud connected bilevel system that leverages the same end-to-end workforce solution that we provide with the AirSense 10 device range. We have introduced the AirCurve 10 less than four months after introducing the AirSense 10. That is a significant improvement for us over the launches of our two previous generations, the S9 and the S8. With just less than a month of sales in Q2 and with its launch limited to just the U.S. market geography, the AirCurve 10 is in its very early days of launch. Looking at the masks and accessories category in the Americas, our AirFit range of masks had solid volume growth in the quarter. We continue gain share on a sequential basis. Customer feedback on the P10, N10 and F10 remain excellent. On a sequential basis, volumes were up and prices were relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, we are starting to see stability in pricing, as we are seeing more steady markets this year than last year. As a reminder, we are expecting pricing in the U.S. to be an easier comparable for year-on-year revenue numbers, after the end of our next quarter ending March 2015. It is important to note that the price adjustments that we started 12 months ago were phased in from January to June 2014 on a product-by-product and a customer-by-customer basis. The facts are that the masks and accessories category continues to be competitive and we are continuing to drive the business in a dynamic market and in a dynamic method. Moving to the respiratory care market, we continue to receive good feedback on our Astral platform, as we launch it to key opinion leader physicians, HMA customers and hospitals across the United Sates. We look forward to growing our U.S. life-support ventilation presence with Astral. With our VPAP COPD device and our Astral platform, as a combined offering in this space, we are uniquely positioned to provide doctors and patients the right treatment, at the right price, at the right time. Now, I'd like to take a broader longer-term global view and spend some time talking about the progress against our three horizons growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth, which includes our core sleep apnea market, we are driving Healthcare Informatics solutions and software engineering innovation, with the launch of our Air Solutions ecosystem and our AirSense 10 platform, as I mentioned earlier. With the launch of the AirCurve 10 platform, we are positioned to drive the efficiency, adherence and the outcomes value proposition even deeper within global markets. The AirCurve 10 range spans from basic bilevel functionality, all the way up to noninvasive ventilation as well as Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology. To sharpen our focus on informatics solutions, this quarter Rob and I established a new global business unit for Healthcare Informatics here at ResMed. This global team will be led by Raj Sodhi. Raj was the CEO and Co-Founder of Umbian, which is a software-as-a-service company that you recall we bought in 2012. Raj has deep experience in running, growing and scaling, both secure and fast moving transactional data systems. And he has had a big impact in the time he's been here at ResMed. He's made the move from Halifax to San Diego, and we welcome him onboard. Healthcare Informatics is now a core competence for our company. It is also a major area for investment that we are using to drive, count and future, customer value. We are leading the digitalization of medicine in the respiratory space, and we are just getting started. On the legal front, in December, we won a patent infringement case against a Chinese-based competitor in the U.S. International Trade Commission, when the commission ruled that their masks infringe our patents. At ResMed, we are committed to protecting our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and defending our over 5,000 patents and designs, so that we can continue to innovate and continue to change millions more lives as we go forward. We will continue to take action to enforce our intellectual property and to defend the significant investment, which is approximately 7% of our revenue this quarter in research and development, with a focus on pioneering clinical research and world leading by medical engineering. We are making solid progress within our second horizon of growth, which includes both our respiratory care market as well as new emerging market growth opportunities. We continue to see solid growth in our European respiratory care business, where we have had a leading presence in homecare ventilation for a number of years. We continue to build our respiratory care channels and strength in the U.S. geography. We have 18 million patients suffering from COPD in the word and 5% to 10 of them being candidates for noninvasive ventilation; we have a lot of runway in front of us. We start adding opportunities from neuromuscular disease like ALS, we are adding muscular dystrophy; we can help millions of patients and also save hundreds of millions of dollars for healthcare systems, by taking care of these patients at home rather than in the hospital. Patients want that, physician want that, payers want that. With accountable care organizations, integrated delivering networks and growing payer-provider models in the U.S. as well as the mostly government-run healthcare systems in Europe and Asia-Pac, we can now say that hospital systems and hospital CEO's are starting to drive towards that same goal. On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets with strong double-digit growth this quarter. We have established long-term investment plans for China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe to ensure that we help establish good protocols for hospital to home as well as the right care models, so that patients and physicians can remain connected. With increasing healthcare investments in emerging markets, we look forward to working with government, so that they can know that they are improving patient outcomes and also being efficient with limited healthcare funds using objective, quantifiable outcomes data. Our third and final horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory conditions, with an emphasis on central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration in heart failure patients. Our SERVE-HF trial is on track and going well. We are now expecting presentation and publication of the SERVE-HF data by the primary investigators some time in light calendar year 2015 or early calendar year 2016. We continue to see excitement in the heart failure and sleep apnea space, and we are facilitating strong partnerships between cardiologists and pulmonary physicians as well as homecare providers. For our CAT-HF clinical trial in the U.S., we continue to enroll patients every week, and we expect that CAT-HF results will be available during calendar year 2017. As a reminder, SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients with CSA, while CAT-HF is powered to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes and to help lead a change in standard of care for heart failure patients. It is important to note that both studies use ResMed's proprietary PaceWave, Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology. We will continue to provide updates, as significant milestones are reached in both of these important, global, pioneering clinical trials. We remain active on the capital management front, including share buybacks and dividends. You'll hear more about these actions in Q2 from Brett in a few moments. Additionally, we continue to look at M&A opportunities that are aligned with our long-term three horizons growth strategy and assets that we can leverage to enhance long-term shareholder value. We have opportunities on our radar screen of all sizes. We have over $400 million in net cash on our balance sheet and significant borrowing capacity. So we have the dry powder that we need to acquire the right assets at the right time and at the right price. Let me close with this, we are excited about our long-term outlook and our three horizons growth strategy. We are executing well to that plan. We continue to lead the market with innovative products, services and solutions that achieve three important end goals that we call, the Holy Grail. Goal one, improve patient quality of life; goal two, halt the progression of important key chronic diseases; and point three, lower the costs of highly-stressed healthcare systems around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q2 financials. Brett? Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the December quarter was $423 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $13.8 million in the second quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $231 million, an increase of 12% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific totaled $192 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific increased by 16% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $111 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $120 million, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific, flow generator sales were $129 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 17%. Masks and other sales were $63 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 20%, while masks and other increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margins for the December quarter were 62.2%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 250 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements. With respect to currency impacts on gross margin going forward, on a sequential basis and assuming current exchange rates, we now expect to see only a very minor positive impact on gross margin, as the impact from a weaker Australian dollar will be largely offset by the weaker euro. Looking forward in the second half of fiscal year 2015, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 60% to 62%, given likely trends in geographic and product mix. As always, we continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $122.5 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%, primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with recent product releases, higher variable employee compensation, some impacts on the recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29% compared to the year ago figure of 29.1%. And looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range 29% for the second half of fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.3 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior-year quarter, but on a constant currency basis an increase of 7%, reflecting incremental investment in areas of Healthcare Informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to the year ago figure of 7.7%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials, but also benefit of the weaker Australian dollar, in which the majority our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.3 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Our effective tax rate for quarter was 21.1%, and we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015 will in fact be in the vicinity of 21%. Net income for the quarter was $91.2 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange movements did negatively impact second quarter earnings per share, but this impact was less than $0.01 year-over-year. The impact from the weaker euro was essentially offset by the weaker Australian dollar. Cash flow from operations was $106 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $19 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $18.9 million. We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, and during the quarter we repurchased 667,000 shares for consideration of $33.5 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 16.8 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. To date, in fiscal year 2015, we have returned 101% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases, and over the last five years, we have returned 97% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $431 million and at December 31 total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A session of the call. We ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Ellen, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : Mick, can you maybe give us some more color in terms of components of that strong U.S. slower growth. You had mentioned that backlog was immaterial going forward, but how much of an impact did that have this quarter versus next towards auto and bilevels and vents? Michael Farrell : So the backlog was pretty modest, Margaret, last quarter. We brought it up, because we thought it was important to just be fully transparent about that. That was in a couple of different stock keeping units, the particular one was the AutoSet for Her stocking keeping unit, which was a brand new algorithm, the first ever introduced to the global market of an algorithm for female breathing patterns. And it was taken up much faster by physicians and homecare providers in the U.S. channel than we had thought. And there were a couple of other varieties, where the ClimateLine air tube goes in or not in the device and some bundling SKUs that were also in backorder. And so what we did in the 90 days is ensure that we got the supply chain up to speed and we're able to deliver that. So as you looked at the 25% year-on-year growth in Americas flow generators, a very small portion of that was to sort of catch up on the backlog. And as we look forward, as I said in the prepared remarks, there is immaterial backlog left. There's still a couple of ones that we are working through, but it's not going to affect the ongoing business, Margaret. Margaret Kaczor : And then in terms of international, I mean again very strong growth out there. What were the country-by-country breakdown, was it Japan, Germany? And then maybe give us more clarity as to why? Michael Farrell : I'll hand to Rob, our COO, present to answer that question. Robert Douglas : Yes, Margaret. We are pretty strong on most of the countries. You would call out France and Japan, but a lot of the other European countries are very strong. We don't give detailed breakdown of all of that, and so we won't be doing that. But really underlying it, patient flows remain strong in all those markets. They haven't all got AirSense 10 yet, but in the markets where they do have it, which is most of them, it's had a very good reception. And as Mick was saying earlier, the Air Solutions is very positive part of the value proposition. And then, of course, Astral was also in the market in Europe. And also, as we said earlier, we've been selling successfully our life support ventilation and it has a strong market position there, and the Astral is building on that and already generating good momentum. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Andrew Goodsall : I just want to talk about gross margin, just to understand where you are in the cycle. Previously, when you've launched a new product, you've been able to extract some costs, I guess, from manufacturers. So just trying to understand a little bit more where you are in that, and I guess, in particular, with the manufacturing mainly in Australia or Singapore at this stage? Michael Farrell : So I'll answer the first part and then maybe handover to Brett to address the second part. I mean with regard to gross margin, in general, when we are successful in growing very well in our flow generators, it's very good in driving the topline, but it has some negative implications on gross margin, so you get the positives of the revenue and the implications on the gross margin. And as we are more successful in growing in the Americas, again, it's very good in driving the topline, but can have an impact on the gross margin. So this quarter you saw very strong growth in flow generators globally and you saw very strong growth in the Americas, and so there was some impact on the gross margin. But, Brett, do you want to provide a little bit more color and detail for Andrew into gross margin, and maybe the guidance of 60% to 62% going forward. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Sure, Mick. And so we just brought it down a little bit really on those factors that I spoke about. With the AirSense and Air Solutions as a whole platform, if you recall, we did elect to put the built-in comms and reinvest some sort of typical savings that we make on platforms back into the platform. I think that's really created quite -- along with whole ecosystem, I think very compelling value prop in the marketplace. So we've done that and we do obviously run cost-out programs and so on, but just in the short-term we've really been focused on ratcheting up supplies to really make demand. So this probably puts a little bit further back in terms of some of these cost-out programs, which will certainly run. But that might be quite short-term, until we catch up with demand properly, and then we can start running those, and start optimizing the factory on efficiencies and so on, rather than just supply. So I think in the longer-term, I'm talking a lot, but after a few quarters, I think we've got some good opportunities to drive some of the cost out the platform, as we did for S9. Operator : The next question is from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Sean Laaman : Just a question on mask in U.S., could you give us a bit of sense, please, Mick, on volume against price? Michael Farrell : Yes, Sean, so actually I'm going to hand that question to Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Americas business. Volumes and price for masks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Mick. Sean, we're seeing good volume growth in masks. And as Mick said in prepared comments, the AirFit line is doing very well. It's being very well received across all three categories, and sequentially we continue to take share in all three categories. I know we've talked about a change in pricing strategy that we had several months ago, and what we're going to see I think is we're against the tougher pricing comp right now, probably through our March quarter than we have been. So I think what we'll see is, with the volume growth we'll also see some improved results, as the pricing sort of cascade through. I think its worth noting that there wasn't a cliff event in that. So what we did, when we changed our pricing strategy in the category, was we empowered our sales representatives to negotiate pricing on a customer-by-customer basis. And so I think we'll see that comparable in terms of ASP feather-in over the course of the second half of the year. Operator : The next question is from David Low with Deutsche Bank. David Low : Just sticking with that mask issue, I have worried for a while now that the mask re-supply business might slow down, as the number of masks to patients doesn't match needs. I'm just wondering whether you get any sense, as to what market growth has been like in the last quarter and even the last year across the mask end of all categories? Michael Farrell : The line was quite soft. So for those who didn't hear the question, it was about mask re-supply and questions of volume really going over versus the sort of price, year-on-year price elements that Jim was talking about. Well, yes, as I said in the introductory remarks and as Jim just commented right now, actually our volume growth both on a year-on-year basis and on a sequential basis is pretty solid in masks. And we actually have pretty good market share data, which we won't share here publicly, David, with regard to each of those categories nasal, pillows, full face, right. So with the N10, the P10 and the F10, we believe we talk incremental sequential volume share from Q1 to Q2, and the products are doing very well out in the market. And to your broader question that the market segment of mask replenishment, it's actually growing quite well, not just within the U.S. market, which I think your question was related to, but also globally. And you saw that in our numbers. One thing that we are working very carefully on is ensuring patients get access to great care. When they get great care, so the informatics systems are there to allow the doctors to interface with them through the Air Solutions platform, when they're engaging with their own therapy through myAir, which is a personalized app for patients, we find that adherence goes up. The U-Sleep program we have running there drives adherence up by up to 10 percentage points, and that drives ongoing adherence and use. So we feel quite confident going forward that volume mask growth will be there. And as we get into more stable pricing environments that you'll start to see that come in through the revenue numbers. That's our long-term goal and that's what we're executing to. David Low : And just one quick follow-up. Market growth rates, I mean clearly we've went through competitive bidding. I presume things have stabilized. Do you have any sense as to whether or do you have a view as to where the market growth has picked up in the last quarter or two? Michael Farrell : I think when you look at a global level, we've got pretty good set of mid-single digit market growth. Our goal is not to accept market growth, but to drive market growth. As you saw our numbers this quarter, we are ahead of that global market growth and that comes from our investments. Brett talked about some of the investments in putting a CDMA chip in every device. That's an investment in driving a value proposition that is now allowing us to achieve very strong flow generator growth in our CPAP and APAP category. That's then going to happen in our bilevel category. We make investments, as we talked about in China and India, by partnering with local governments and partnering to developed infrastructure and education of physicians to facilitate the growth of both sleep apnea and respiratory care opportunity. So we think that those market growth rates are not only sustainable, but we are expanding beyond them with our cardiorespiratory care, our SERVE-HF investment and others. Operator : The next question is from Steve Wheen with JPMorgan. Steve Wheen : Just a question for Brett, just on the gross margin guidance, there is obviously a few moving parts there. I wonder if you could just separate out what the currency-related effect on that gross margin shift down that you are expecting for the remainder of this calendar year? Brett Sandercock : Going forward, Steve, if you look at currency impacts and it's so volatile at a moment, I'm kind of bit reticent than say anything. But if you looked at it right here now, whilst we're expecting a reasonable benefit maybe a quarter or two ago, that's really down, I think probably a positive benefit as little as 10 basis points going into Q3. And it will be a little better in Q4 and get a bit more of the Aussie coming through, because of that lag impact. But the fairly small now, given how weak the euro has been. I mean we're still in pretty reasonable position, because the Aussie is essentially offsetting that weakness in the euro. But we are not getting as a pronounced benefit as we might have seen, if we were talking about this 36 months ago. Steve Wheen : So the major driver of you downgrading, I guess, your expectations around gross margin, what would be the major driver there? Michael Farrell : Look, the trends around geographic around product mix, I think if you looked at likely trends there, I think that's just enough that we feel that the margin might trend down a little, and we wanted to just bring that guidance down a little to account for that. Operator : The next question is from David Clair with Piper Jaffray. David Clair : My first question is on the flow generator number in the U.S. I'm just wondering if you can give us some more detail behind what drove the strength there. I mean are we seeing, is that Astral getting traction or it's just the new product launches in general? And then, you face another pretty easy comp next quarter, so should we think that I guess a result in this ballpark is achievable again next quarter? Michael Farrell : Well, thanks, David. I'll take the first half of the question, and hand the second half to Rob. With the first half of where the growth came from in the quarter for the flow generators in the Americas, we launched both the AirSense 10 and the Astral to our U.S. sales force at the same time. It was at the Americas Sales Meeting in August, here in San Diego, and then the teams had to get out there and talk to their customers around the traps and get them up to speed. For the AirSense 10, the value proposition was built-in. And as I talked about, it's not about the AirSense 10, it's about the Air Solutions Healthcare Informatics ecosystem. And it sounds like a whole bunch of buzz was, but when you drill it down, what it does is it save costs and it saves time, and it saves money for our homecare provider customers. And so patients gets more engaged in their therapy and physicians allows them to do management by exception and manage a whole portfolio of patients. And so when you nail value propositions for three of your key constituents and they get it, you get a really quick ramp up. And now our U.S. sleep and respiratory distribution system is very good, second to none in the U.S. market. And so I think that's what drove the vast majority of the very successful sort of 25% year-on-year growth for the Americas in flow gens for the quarter. Your question was, is it Astral? Astral, we are just developing the U.S. respiratory channel for life support ventilation. It's the first FDA 510(k) clearance we've had of a life support ventilator. And we've got a very strong Respiratory Account Manager or RAM team out there around the United States driving the message. But it will take some time for the homecare providers to test the product and get to like it and for the doctors to get used to, how it works, doing the settings at the RT, the respiratory therapist level and driving it. So it's a much longer and deeper S-curve, but its impact in that first quarter was much less than the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions platform. So that's the first half about the products. It's mostly AirSense 10 and much less Astral. Rob, do you want to take the thoughts for next quarter? Robert Douglas : Yes, obviously, when I get specific about what's coming up on the quarters, but what we play is it the value proposition behind the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions platform is quite solid. We're not resting on our laurels around that and our team is doing everything to promote it and convert our customers to it. Also, our in-house teams are still continually developing it, and we've got a lot of improvements, but again it come through in that system in the near-term future. So our view is that this value proposition should keep being seen by the customer, and the results will then speak for themselves. Similarly, with Astral, it's still early days in that product, and we believe that it's performing very well and getting a great response and we think that should continue. So over the long-term those products are really going to keep contributing for us. David Clair : And then any updates, where we are in terms of home sleep testing? Michael Farrell : David, home sleep testing, are you talking globally or U.S. geography? David Clair : U.S.? Michael Farrell : U.S. So within the U.S. market, we have sort of two models. We have our own ResMed model and then we have a retrospective data analysis, where we look at both public data and some private data. The proprietary data that we get access to and those models provide a range, and so we based on those two models believe that anywhere 35% to 45%. When you take a trialing 12 months anywhere between 35% to 45% of the sleep diagnostic tests in the U.S. were done using home sleep testing. But it's growing everyday, it's growing every quarter. And as broken out by geography and healthcare system type, if you take, I don't know, the northeast maybe Massachusetts and look at an area where you have a specialty benefits manager driving with a payer, a model, you can get areas where it's up to 75% or 80%-plus home sleep testing within that type of a system. And then you can get states in this out like Alabama, where there is a very strong push from the local physicians groups and it's only 5% of the tests within that geography. And so you've got a big range and it's very hard to put a precise number on it. So the range is 35% to 45%. But we expect it to go up every quarter, because the payers are driving it in and pushing that forward. Our challenge in making it all happen is ensuring that we provide the right systems to both ways of getting diagnosis done. So we have the ApneaLink Air platform, which is a cloud-connected home sleep testing system. That after the device is finished, the data go to the cloud, and you can see the doctor that day, and they have access to the information you got from that previous night. And we think that sort of efficiency in taking care of patients and helping doctors and helping the system work is very important for us. We also have partner with sleep labs, and we have the VPAP TX titration system, which is basically a box that has all of our algorithms in one box. And the respiratory PSG technicians, the RPSGTs and the sleep physicians can operate and prescribe Adaptive-Servo Ventilation or bilevel ST or APAP out of that. What we're seeing with that trend, as the home sleep testing of 35% to 45% increases to 40% to 50% and 45% to 55% overtime is that you get a mix shift in the devices that come out on the backend, so that you get more of a mix shifts from CPAP to APAP. So in our case, from our basic CPAPs up to our AutoSet type product. Operator : The next question is from Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse. Saul Hadassin : Mick, just following up on that commentary around that mix shift. I'm just wondering, if you're able to give us a sense of how far you guys are progressed in moving to APAP versus fixed pressure and how much runway you see in terms of uplift to that number? Michael Farrell : So, Saul, as you know we don't provide the details of the sort of split by product category code, but we do talk about trends. And so as you see that 35% to 45% go to 40% to 50% and 45% to 55%, you can think that the sort of a baseline of a minimum of one-to-one of what you get out of APAPs from that for new patient setups. And then there is a halo effect, as physicians see the benefits of AutoSet that AutoSet has not only intra-night variability that it monitors breath-by-breath what's going on, it has inter-night variability that people might have more alcohol on a Friday or Saturday night or during flu season might have a high pressure needed to overcome apnea with inflamed upper airway or whatever. And so we are seeing a trend that's ahead of those numbers that you see in the home sleep testing one. But we are not going to break it exactly down for competitive reasons. But it's a positive trend, it has been and it will continue to be for quite a while in the future. Saul Hadassin : And just to follow-up on the COPD space in U.S., can you give us some color around any easing of restrictions for patients accessing the VPAP for COPD? And just what you're seeing with demand and patient accessibility to that specific device? Michael Farrell : I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. David Pendarvis : Yes, Saul, there has been a lot of talk about trying to ease the restrictions for device like a VPAP COPD, so that you can get it to the patients who really need it and it can be just as easy to prescribe as other devices. At the moment, those efforts haven't yielded fruit yet, but it's still an effort that we see that is underway and we'd be optimistic that that device will be more available in the future. Obviously, it plays a good positioning in the marketplace and we've got our life support ventilation device in the U.S. that can fit other codes as well. So we feel like we're pretty well-positioned with an offering in each reimbursement category. And so that if those category shift one way or the other, we are positioned with the right device for the patients, gives them the right care, but we'll also fit the reimbursement category as the payers drive. Operator : The next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Maybe just to begin on the AirSense 10 and to drive into that a little bit. Can you give us a sense first on pricing and how the series compares to prior generations of flow generators, say, the S9? And then, Mick, you shared quite a bit on just the benefits for DME customers and driving essentially savings and efficiency for their businesses. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit and maybe quantify how an AirSense 10 is benefiting above and beyond, say, an S9? Michael Farrell : Yes. I'll hand that question to Jim, who runs our Americas. I might follow-up after. Jim Hollingshead : So in terms of AirSense 10 and pricing, we're seeing that AirSense 10 pricing is actually holding up very well. The bulk of our growth in the quarter was with AirSense 10, and we think the value proposition is strong and the pricing has held up pretty strongly. In terms of efficiencies -- well, if I just say, the AirSense 10 as a flow gen, just as a product is an outstanding product. When you layer on top of that what we called the health informatics ecosystem and then set a solution that ride on that platform, you're adding extra to just the decision on flow generate that's already a winning flow gen. The way it drives efficiencies for our customers is, as Mick was saying, it takes our cost. For example, somebody has an AirSense 10 and they're using our U-Sleep platform, they are able to manage patients by exception, so they are managing patients based upon their compliance. They are automating to some extent, coaching for compliance. So that's both a revenue generator and a cost cutter. And we published a study, it was actually a randomized control trial a few months ago, that showed that for one of our customers who actually ran an RCT in this space, they were able to increase compliance by 10 points off of the very high standard of care compliance rate from 70 to 80, but they were able to cut their labor cost to 59%. And that's just one of the features in the solution and that's just the solution that's out now. There is a roadmap for solutions that are coming. So in addition to continue to provide just an outstanding product that's comfortable, quiet, easy to fit, easy to set up, we're providing solutions on top of that that are going to increase revenue and save cost for our customers. Michael Farrell : The only thing I'd add on to that, Anthony, to what Jim said, which is really good comment, is as an addition for the ability to do remote assist, and so our HMEs can remotely, HME customers can remotely access their patients' devices over the web. So they can be on Air Solutions, on AirView specifically and interrogate the capability of a flow generator. So if a patient says, look, I've got a problem and the humidifier is not working, they are able to go online and say, well, actually, look I just did an interrogation on machine and it looks like it is working, but I see the setting is at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. What's your thermostat set on at home? And they can say real-time, well, it's set of 72, and they can say, well, you know what, it's not going to heat if it's set at 70 and the thermostat is 72. Why don't I change that up to 74, and it will heat up tonight. And that conversation, which is two minutes could have been a device driven into an HME. So the patient is upset. The DME sending it back to ResMed's tech service center, our team analyzing and saying no fault found, shipping it back, and then getting it back to the patient. All that inefficiency of the FedEx, the patient time, the RT time, our technician's time, it's all tax, it's all waste. We can eliminate that. It's good for us, as ResMed, allows us to be more efficient. It's good for our customers, our HME providers be more efficient. And most important of all, it's good for the patient, who gets the care, they can stick to the care and they're not without it and they are not upset about it. So those two examples of taking labor cost out and reducing inefficiency in the supply chain are just some of the benefits, the early benefits we're seeing with Air Solutions. Anthony Petrone : And real quick, just on buyback. Just an update there, where the program is and will you accelerate that, given where the gross margin outlook kind of is at this point and some of the FX headwinds? Michael Farrell : Brett, you want to take that? Brett Sandercock : I mean we've been reasonably consistent I think on the buyback, in some years we've buyback more than others. The baseline we look at is certainly to buyback enough to offset the dilution from any issues to employees in terms of equity. That's sort of probably around between 1 million and 1.5 million shares as a baseline. And then, typically we do a little more than that. So we did 667,000 shares this quarter. We will certainly continue to buyback stock and it will just depend on kind of what's happening, and we'll have a baseline that we'll buyback and then kind of somewhat opportunistically a little bit after that, I guess. Operator : And the next question is from Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Ian Abbott : My first question is just around competitive bidding around three. Just wondering if you could perhaps give your view on how big an event it is for the industry relative to see V2? Michael Farrell : I will hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. David Pendarvis : From our perspective in the sleep space and the respiratory space, so sort of excluding oxygen importantly, it's about 30% or so of the Medicare patients who are remaining. So you size the thing on an overall basis, think of the U.S. being 50% of our business and think of Medicare patients who are in the U.S. being roughly 20% to 25% of that. And then you've got of that Medicare population roughly 30% or so remaining in CV3. I think some of the estimates that are out there have broader product offerings from DMEs, including oxygen and other things would be greater than 30%, but from our patient perspective that's how we would size it up. Obviously, the rules that are out there are showing that it's going to phase-in in January 2016 with sort of a blend of half-and-half of the existing rates and half of the average rates from the other regions, and then that phases into a full average once you get to July 1, 2016. So that's where we see it going. There's not a lot of mystery about that. At this point, obviously we work with our customers and our customers have discussions with CMS all the time about, whether they can improve on that and do more in the rural areas, et cetera, for the few details that are left. But from a sizing perspective, it's relatively small size of our overall global business. Ian Abbott : If I could ask Brett a question, just I'm not sure if I might have missed it, but just touching on the contingent consideration write-back, can you perhaps expand on that? Brett Sandercock : Yes, sure. That was in our SG&A, and that was release that we did 12 months ago and that was just impacting the comparable for this year. Something we did at this time last year. Operator : The next question is from Craig Collie with Macquarie. Craig Collie : A couple of questions from me. The first on the strong flow gen numbers. So any chance of, I guess, splitting that out between what you think are new patients to I guess sleep therapy, and what the remaining portion, in terms of existing patients, upgrading the old flow generators? Michael Farrell : Good question, Craig. I'm going to hand that to Jim Hollingshead. JimHollingshead: It's a great question, Craig. We're not going to guide on that. If we had the data -- we don't have clear data on that to begin with, but if we did we probably wouldn't guide on it. Craig Collie : Second question on bundling, any updates on whether the pilot started and I guess any detail around that? David Pendarvis : We don't have a lot of details yet on what that pilot would include other than it's suppose to be six markets on sort of the control arm, if you will, and six markets on the bundled arm. But CMS hasn't come out with the details on that. They were suppose to be able to start anywhere in 2015, and there has been no start and no announcement of when it will start. Obviously, they can delay it or start it whenever they like, but you'd expect them to give the market a good notice. So we're waiting to get the details on what that might look like, but we're prepared to support our customers anyway we might need to. Craig Collie : And you remain relatively relaxed about that, I guess, given that the fact it's going to be appearing to be no minimum supply requirements? David Pendarvis : Actually, Craig, we don't know that. We don't know if there will be no requirements or if required two masks a year or one mask a year or how many filters and how many tubing. We actually know nothing about. They haven't given any details. As you know, Craig, we operate in a 100 countries and we operate in many different environments, including where there bundle payments and whether or not. And we sell in some markets through pharmacies, in some markets we work with otherwise to get direct to patients. And what we've found is that in the markets, where bundling has happened we partner with our homecare providers and we've been able to ensure that not only are the homecare provider is taken care of, but really importantly that the patients are able to get access to masks and accessories. And the person that really wants this new mask is a person that's putting it on every night. And if it's difficult in the reimbursement environment to get it, particularly in the U.S., with increasing high deductible health plans and health savings accounts, we're finding a lot of people who are going online to get those types of devices. And so we think that a lot of HME providers, they are establishing those sort of online networks, and we are partnering with them in many different countries in the world. And the good news about the government is it will take a while. They will have to do the pilots and they'll have to get feedback from their constituents, because these are the Medicare beneficiaries, and it will take some time for them to ramp up. It will give us time and Jim's team time to partner with the U.S. homecare providers. And what we'll do is get global earning from Germany and France and many other countries, where we operate in that environment, and make sure that the homecare providers, the patients and the healthcare system is properly taken care of. And we think that can be done quite efficiently. Operator : The next question is from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Well, I have a couple of questions. You sounded more optimistic on M&A on this call than you have at any other stage. Is there something that has changed for you? Michael Farrell : No, Joanne. I just think that as you talk about capital management, you have to talk about the three arms of it. One arm is making sure that we continue the share buyback, as Brett talked about, it's opportunistic, but it's steady. The second arm is obviously our dividends, which we've established a number of years ago and have increased most years, and we announced another $0.28 today from the board. And the third arm is M&A. And I just wanted to make it clear that with $400 million of net cash and access to over $700 million through a syndicate loan facility that we declared recently, we have the dry powder to do that. There is nothing eminent on the radar screen that we can talk about or that's there right now that we should talk about. Joanne Wuensch : And one of the things that you said, if I heard you correctly, was that there was some M&A or some acquisition revenue in the quarter. I don't remember seeing a press release regarding that. Could you remind me what it was? And what that revenue might've been in terms of dollars? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks Joanne. They are pretty small, and I'll hand that to Rob Douglas to talk about any M&A in the last six to 12 months. Robert Douglas : Yes, sure. So Joanne, we had previously talked about some small acquisitions of some Australian distributors that we've made over the last few quarters and it also included a small one in New Zealand. But what's happening in those markets is they are unique different markets. And it's quite unusual particularly in Australia, where there is strong reimbursement for getting diagnosed with sleep apnea, but little contribution from government or any public systems even towards any of the treatment. And so it's a unique market, quite differently structured, and we thought that we could help really develop the market there and drive awareness, if we're a little bit closer to some of their customers and patients. So we're just really trying a marketing experiment in those countries and we'll let you know the results, as they become relevant. Joanne Wuensch : The emails that I am getting so far are questions and you can hear it throughout this whole call about your flow generators. And it's going in two directions. One, wow, can they do 20-something percent next quarter? And two, doesn't masks and accessories follow a strong flow placement? So how would you respond to that? Michael Farrell : Well, Joanne, as you know, we don't give guidance on a revenue basis and we don't give guidance on the category basis around flow generators. So look, we do think it was an excellent performance clearly from both our Americas team and our Europe and our Asia-Pacific team on the flow generator category, but that's the result of three to five years of amazing product development work from engineering teams in Munich, Singapore, Sydney, San Diego and Halifax. And so that great level of biomedical engineering, software engineering has created a value proposition that the marketplace is finding compelling. And we were surprised at how successful it was in that first quarter, because we thought it would take some time to walk through. Some of these savings take time for the provider and take time for the patient to get, it did come out of the gate strong, and we do think there is a long runway. The value propositions that payback over many, many, not just quarters, but years for our customers and our patients and our homecare providers and suppliers. So we think it goes pretty well along that front. I don't know, if anyone else has got anything to add to that. Jim? Jim Hollingshead : I think it's actually pretty simple, which is, we are taking share in masks sequentially, we're taking share in flow gen faster, even faster. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. End of Q&A Michael Farrell : Great. Thanks, Ellen. In closing, I'd like to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their contribution to our recent product launches and for their continued commitment to our long-term goals. We remain focused on changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath, and we remain inspired by our long-term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for you time today. And we'll talk to you again in 90 days. Agnes Lee : This concludes our second quarter earnings live webcast.

My name is Adrienne and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Adrienne. And thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Agnes and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal year 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we continued to make excellent progress from new product launches in our core sleep disorder breathing market. We also saw solid progress in our cardiology and respiratory care markets during the quarter. In these opening remarks, I'll discuss our high-level top and bottom line results, our progress in healthcare informatics and the early trajectory of our latest product and solution launches globally. Finally, I'll cover progress against our longer-term three horizons growth strategy. Then I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney, our CFO to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. As you saw in our press release, our global business achieved double-digit revenue growth of 13% on a constant currency basis during the quarter. Including currency headwinds, our global growth was 6% on a year-on-year basis in U.S. dollars. We saw strength in our Americas group, with continued double-digit growth in the region, driven by robust sales growth in flow generators as well as high-single-digit constant currency growth in our combined European and Asia-Pacific region. These results were fueled by the success of new product launches in sleep apnea and respiratory care markets, including both COPD and neuromuscular disease states. Looking at the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share was $0.65 on a non-GAAP basis. EPS was $0.64 on a GAAP basis. In the Americas, we had strong performance in Q3 sales, with the commercial team there driving 16% year-on-year growth. We're particularly pleased with flow generator growth in the region which was over 40%. This exceptional result was driven by the ongoing successful rollout of our Astral, our AirSense 10 and our AirCurve 10 platforms. Customers continue to see the value proposition of our healthcare informatics platform that we have branded Air Solutions. This platform continues to drive our flow generator success. The strong flow generator sales were partially offset by lower mask sales. On that front, we're still facing annualization of price adjustments that we made from January through to June in 2014. In addition, we're facing a tough competitive environment in the mask category. However, we're confident that we will return to positive growth in the mask and accessory category as we move forward. Moving on to our combined European and Asia-Pacific region, we grew at a very solid 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. After we account for the strong currency headwinds, particularly from the declining euro and the strong U.S. dollar, headline growth declined by 6% for the combined Europe and Asia-Pacific region. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators in Europe associated with our new product launches as well as steady growth in masks in the region. With the latest launch of our AirCurve 10 bilevel flow generator platform in Europe, we continue to add to the broad suite of launches with solid multiyear product life cycles. There continues to be strong interest in respiratory care and cardiorespiratory opportunities across the European region. We have seen good adoption of our Astral platform in Europe and we're excited about future opportunities as we combine Astral with our healthcare informatics solutions. We continued to work with our European and Asia-Pac teams to develop treatment pathways that facilitate standard-of-care protocols, including both pulmonary and cardiology physician groups in both hospital and home care environments. As an important component of our SERVE-HF clinical trial, we're investing in cardiology awareness, cardiology screening and cardiology diagnostic referral infrastructure to the pulmonary folks in the European region and beyond. I will discuss SERVE HF in more detail later on in these remarks. In Asia-Pac, we're continuing to execute on our strategies for longer-term growth while working across a variety of mask and market delivery channels. In addition, we had strong double-digit growth in key emerging market countries, particularly China, as we continue to build for the future in those markets. Let me spend a few moments reviewing some of the background behind our progress in informatics. As outlined earlier, we call our healthcare informatics ecosystem Air Solutions. Air Solutions is providing significant quantifiable value to our customers, leading to discretionary share gains in flow generators sales. More importantly, Air Solutions use liberating data to help patients, physicians, providers, government and private payers and other partners in the healthcare delivery channel. We're seeing the results of our innovation, even though it is just over seven months since the launch of our first AirSense 10 product. Customers have recognized the value of Air Solutions, an end-to-end system that can help them one, lower costs; two, drive efficiencies; three, increase patient adherence; and four, improve patient care. During the quarter, we further enhanced the Air Solutions ecosystem through the integration of our AirView software with leading healthcare informatics partners. We also announced the acquisition of Jaysec. Jaysec is a provider of Internet-based software solutions for our home medical equipment customers. This acquisition allows us to deliver automated, streamlined business solutions, such as mask and accessory resupply systems, that are both cost effective and drive efficiencies for our HME partners. We're offering all Jaysec products to all customers. We see many opportunities to enhance and expand our informatics solution as the broader healthcare industry continues to move towards connected care models. We will use our newest core competence in healthcare informatics to drive channel efficiencies, to unlock cost savings and most importantly, to improve patient outcomes. Let me drill into the detail of our new product launches just a little. We launched the AirCurve 10 in the U.S. in December. And although it is still early days, we had good uptake and excellent customer feedback in this, our first full quarter of sales. We also launched the AirCurve 10 in Europe during Q3. This included an important new device, the AirCurve CS PaceWave. PaceWave is our brand name for our proprietary minute ventilation-targeted adaptive servo-ventilation therapy. The acronym for this algorithm is MVASV. But I think that PaceWave is easier to remember. Our PaceWave algorithm is unique and highly protected with patents and other intellectual property. As part of the AirCurve 10 launch, we added Air Solutions, our cloud-based software solutions technology, to our bilevel, our noninvasive ventilation and our adaptive servo-ventilation platforms. The combination of the AirCurve 10 CS PaceWave with our Air Solutions platform is particularly powerful, given the hospitalization rates and the severity of disease for patients who suffer from heart failure and concomitant sleep apnea. For our mask and accessories category, the market remains stable, but competitive. As I stated earlier, we're confident that we will return to solid growth in the mask and accessory category as we move forward. Now I would like to take a broader longer-term view and spend some time talking about progress against our global three horizons growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth which includes our core sleep apnea market, we have continued to drive healthcare informatics solutions that meet our customers' needs for efficiency, patient adherence and improved outcomes. Our recent acquisition of Jaysec and completing our integration with leading informatics partners are good milestones in that journey. We're taking advantage of future opportunities to grow even more connected care solutions with customers through the AirCurve 10 launch. Reimbursement remains relatively stable across our geographies, including the U.S. Last week, our U.S. customers welcomed positive news as Obama signed the doc fix bill which added anti-fraud provisions to competitive bidding. This change requires binding bids and proof that a DME or HME is licensed in the state that it is providing products to customers. Although this legislation does not impact current bidding rounds, it will have a positive impact on future recompete rounds. The bottom line is that this should improve the quality of bidders to ensure that they deliver good service to patients and it should improve the stability of the channel. On the legal front, we won an injunction against a Chinese-based competitor in Germany during February. The Munich District Court upheld its injunction that prohibits the sale or distribution of that company's masks that infringe our patents. At ResMed, we're committed to protecting our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and we will defend our more than 5000 patents and designs so that we can continue to innovate and continue to change millions of lives as we move forward. We will continue to take action to enforce our intellectual property and to defend our significant investment in research and development. Our global R&D investment is holding strong, at approximately 7% of our revenues, with a focus on pioneering clinical research, world-leading biomedical engineering and cutting-edge healthcare informatics. Moving on to our second horizon of growth, we're making solid progress on two fronts, our respiratory care market as well as our emerging markets growth. The European respiratory care business is growing from the strong base that we have developed over the last decade and more. In the U.S., we continue to build our respiratory care channels and our strength in those channels. There is a very long runway ahead for COPD and neuromuscular disease patients to be helped by our Astral life-support ventilator and our other offerings. The Astral platform allows patient care to take place in the home rather than in the hospital, providing better quality of life for patients, including caregivers and loved ones and simultaneously taking costs out of strained healthcare systems. On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets, with solid double-digit growth this quarter. We've increased our investment in these markets and are executing on our long term strategies in China, India, Brazil, as well as Eastern Europe., where there are great opportunities to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs across these emerging markets. Our third horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory conditions, with an emphasis on central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration, particularly in heart failure patients. There is growing momentum in the heart failure and sleep apnea space and we continue to facilitate strong partnerships between cardiologists and critical care and pulmonary physicians. There have been a number of new studies this quarter that continue to build a connection between heart failure and SDB, including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. At the American College of Cardiology, or ACC, meeting here in San Diego, we sponsored two posters on sleep disordered breathing in patients with chronic heart failure. One of the posters with final data from nearly 7000 patients in Germany showed that 46% of patients with stable chronic heart failure had moderate to severe SDB, AHI north of 15. That's almost every second patient that walks in the cardiologists' door. The second poster from Thomas Jefferson University suggested that treating SDB in chronic heart failure patients may reduce hospital admission and hospital readmission rates. In addition, Ohio State University research has published a study in January showing that patients with untreated sleep apnea have worse prognosis for mortality after they have been discharged from the hospital for acute heart failure. The data suggests that those that had their sleep apnea treated with PAP therapy improved survival rates, approximately to rates that were similar to patients who had heart failure with minimal or no sleep apnea. This study supports the work that we're doing on our SERVE-HF and our CAT-HF clinical trials. Focusing now on those trials. Our SERVE-HF trial in Europe and Australia is going well. In fact, data collection has been occurring at a faster pace during these last three months. As a result, we're now expecting presentation of the SERVE-HF data by the primary investigators to occur before the end of calendar year 2015. This is slightly ahead of the timeline that we discussed on our Q2 call. For our CAT-HF clinical trial in the U.S., we still expect that the CAT-HF results will be available during calendar year 2017. As a reminder, SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients with CSA, while CAT-HF is powered show improvements in global cardiovascular outcomes. Both trials lead to a potential change in guiding principles and standard-of-care for heart failure patients. It is important to note that both studies use ResMed's proprietary minute ventilation-targeted adaptive servo-ventilation technology which the acronym again is MVASV, that we have branded PaceWave. We will continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached in both of these important and pioneering clinical trials. We remain active on the capital management front, including share buybacks and dividends. You will hear more about these actions in Q3 from Brett in a couple of minutes. Additionally, we continue to look at M&A opportunities that are aligned with our long term three horizon growth strategy and assets that we can leverage, manage better than the current owners and enhance long term shareholder value. Let me close with this. We're excited about our long term outlook and our three horizons growth strategy. We're progressing on our journey to change 20 million lives by 2020 in both sleep and broader respiratory medicine. We're executing well to that plan. With that, I will turn the care over to Brett in Sydney for a more detailed review of our Q3 financials. Brett? Brett Sandercock : Great. Thank you, Mick. As Mick has noted, our revenue for the March quarter was $422.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $28.5 million in the third quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $250.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific totaled $171.6 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior-year quarter. But in constant currency terms, sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segment, Americas' flow generators sales were $133.1 million, an increase of 42% over the prior-year quarter. While masks and other sales were $117.8 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in Europe and Asia-Pacific, flow generator sales were $115.9 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, an increase of 13%. Masks and other sales were $55.7 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 3%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 26%, while masks and other decreased by 1% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margins for the March quarter were 59.5%, lower than guidance essentially due to larger-than-expected depreciation of the euro during the quarter and outperformance on Americas flow generator growth. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 380 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices, unfavorable product mix, unfavorable geographic mix and adverse currency movements. Looking forward in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we expect gross margin to be broadly consistent with Q3, being in the range of 59% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. Gross margin drivers, like currency fluctuations and geographic and product mix could swing this range further if they move beyond their expectations. We do expect to see some traction in late Q4 from our cost-out programs for the AirSense platform and should see ongoing benefits from our cost-out programs, including procurement, production and logistics improvements reflected in our fiscal year 2016 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $116.3 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%, primarily due to higher variable employee compensation, the impact of recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27.5% compared to the year-ago figure of 28.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior-year quarter. But on a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. This increase largely reflects incremental investment in the areas of healthcare informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials, but also a benefit of the weaker Australian dollar, in which the majority of our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.2 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015 will be in the range of 20% to 21%. Net income for the quarter was $91 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted third-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro, partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar. Cash flow from operations was $90.9 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $10.6 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $17.9 million. We've continued to be active on the capital management front and our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. And during the quarter, we repurchased 300,000 shares for consideration of $20.3 million. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2015, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares for consideration of $96.7 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 16.5 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. To-date in fiscal year 2015, we have returned 92% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. And over the last five years, we have returned 98% free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $406 million. And at March 31, total assets were $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Adrienne, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please go ahead. Andrew Goodsall : I was just going to perhaps focus on masks. Just trying to sort of understand when we might expect -- or what internally you're seeing yourself doing when we might expect, I guess, that to sort of show up in the numbers in terms of recovery against, perhaps, when you moved your prices last year. And perhaps just a comment on the percentage conversion you might be seeing of your flow generators in the mask conversion -- why that's up perhaps a little higher? Mick Farrell : That question allows us to talk a little bit about the mask side. And we're expecting to return to positive growth, not just in the Americas, but globally, to continue good trends we have outside the Americas. The mask category continues to be competitive Andrew, but stable. We'll be annualizing those price declines that we made a year ago, January through June of 2014, through January through June 2015. So we're over the halfway point, but there is still some sort of time to -- as we went customer by customer, region by region, for those to annualize. So as we look forward, we will get back to positive growth. And we have a strong mask portfolio and a good pipeline to follow beyond that. Andrew Goodsall : And is it reasonable to sort of expect that you're achieving some level of, I guess, conversion along with the flow generator with your bundling or looking to sell the solution as a combined solution? Mick Farrell : Andrew, there is some halo effect, certainly when you walk in with the value proposition of the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions. And as you saw, stellar growth of 42% year-on-year in the Americas there. You've obviously got a sales force with a lot of interest from their customers. And it allows conversations to start, obviously, about other parts of the business, like ventilation, like respiratory care and like masks. So I do think there are some halo effects that come from that. But I think some of the more important factors are the fact that we're annualizing the January to June price adjustments. The market is competitive and our team is getting back on the front foot in that category while winning very strongly in some other categories. Operator : And the next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Margaret Kaczor : Couple ones from me. Can you maybe comment on U.S. generator growth which clearly accelerated this quarter. How sustainable is that? And are you seeing a similar growth rate that you saw in AirSense 10 last quarter or is that also accelerating? Mick Farrell : Margaret, I'll take the first part of that question and I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas, for the second one. Clearly, with a number like that that we probably haven't seen since 2006, 2007 of 42% growth for the quarter year-on-year in flow generators in the Americas, you're not just growing with the market. You're clearly taking some share. So to the extent that there is market share taking, that can happen for a period of time and then that period of time ends. But we do think that there's strong growth in the core U.S. market and, frankly, in our core global markets in the sleep disorder breathing space. And we expect that to continue, because we're vastly underpenetrated in developed markets as well as our developing and emerging markets. Jim, would you like to add any more color that? Jim Hollingshead : Sure, Mick. Thanks. And thanks for the question, Margaret. We think that the flow gen growth represents not just the fact that the AirSense 10 platform and the AirCurve 10 platform are really strong products in their own right as flow gens and bilevels, but also the recognition on the part of our customers of the value of the all-in solution that we're offering. So both of those platforms have onboard communications, but it goes beyond just having an onboard modem. It allows our customers to drive efficiencies into their businesses through the use of our solution software platform. So the number of features related to our software that are driving efficiencies in our customers' business and we think we have a very clear advantage with the overall offer in the market right now that customers are taking advantage of. Margaret Kaczor : Okay. So you guys are seeing kind of similar or maybe accelerating growth in AirSense as kind of the way that I read maybe that answer. And then Brett, can you walk us through the gross margins this quarter? You guys broadly talked about FX. Which currencies are most important? And then just to make sure, the price declines that you guys cited in the press release are really year over year versus sequential. Brett Sandercock : On the gross margin, it's all the margin drivers, essentially, but I think it's happened for long time is really mostly sort of headwinds for us this time around. So we had, obviously, year-on-year your currency impact was negative for us. That's really being driven by the euro which has declined quite significantly, as I think everybody knows. We do get some offset for the Aussie dollar weakening, but to some extent, that's to the lag the quarter before it turns up in margin. So I do expect -- well, all things being equal on currency which is probably a big assumption, but I do expect with that Aussie weakness, some of that benefit will flow through into Q4 for us. We haven't seen that in Q3, but we do cop up front, if you like, that euro falls straightaway. So I think that's something that will help us going into Q4. But then you have other -- the product mix and geographic mix and really that's kind of driven by flow gen outperformance in the U.S.. So you've got that geographic impact and that product mix impact. And they've been negative for us as well. And really, even on the sort of optimization of production and manufacturing, something that we have a really good track record on, really haven't been able to focus on that just at the moment. We've really been looking to make sure that we meet demand in the marketplace. And obviously take for granted that we absolutely don't compromise on quality either, but what we have had to do is probably just delay a little bit on the cost-out programs. We're obviously getting on to those now and I think we'll see some benefit there. There are other things, like we've been running with much higher air freight than we typically would. Again, that's really a consequence of meeting demand, particularly on that flow gen growth number that you saw. So there is just a number of factors. A lot of those are kind of first-class problems to have. And the ones in the cost side though, they are under our control and we'll absolutely get on top of those. Margaret Kaczor : Is there anything that you can quantify in that in terms of the FX impact this quarter? Brett Sandercock : Yes. If you looked at -- yes, I mean, the year-on-year -- without -- I don't get too granular, but it's quite meaningful, as it's north of 50 basis points negative. Operator : And your next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Wheen : Just a follow-up question on the gross margin. Brett, there is a lot of I guess, things that you can do going forward. I was just surprised to see your guidance for the fourth quarter be very much the same as third quarter. So can you tell us what is sort of holding you back on that front? Brett Sandercock : I guess just looking at what we're seeing in terms of product and geographic trends, okay which it probably tend to be negative on that. But offsetting that, I think we'll see some benefit from the weaker Aussie and we will start to see some of our cost-out program gain some traction. So when you look at it, we have some -- going forward, looks like we have some negative drivers, if you like and then there is some positive ones. And there is a question of what the timing is like and how they balance up. And when I looked at it, I think in that kind of short term, where we broadly consistent with where we're in Q3, when we look forward and we look at some of the things that are coming through, if you think of the AirCurve on the bilevels, if you think of Astral and as we build that market in the U.S., clearly, those sort of products will be supportive of the margin. I think we'll get some momentum on our cost-out programs; that will be supportive of the margin. So you can see some of these shorter-term headwinds, I think, will certainly abate. And then some of them, I think, will turn positive for us. Yes, if you look forward, I think optimistic on the margin, but at the moment, we're dealing with quite a few headwinds. But notwithstanding those, I think the margin is in pretty good shape. Steve Wheen : And could you just sort of provide some comment on some of the rest-of-world markets, maybe France, Germany and Japan? Perhaps most interest in Japan as to -- that's obviously been quite historically lumpy. What your experience was in the latest quarter for that region? Mick Farrell : Steve, that's great question. I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to talk through those. Rob Douglas : Thanks, Steve. So Japan, yes, is historically lumpy. It had a pretty good quarter this quarter with the products getting good take up going well. We continue to have excellent relationships with our customers and we stay in close touch. And the market there is very stable and moving along well, but will continue to be lumpy through the ordering patterns. Europe had a pretty good quarter as well. France performed well. There is still the debate going on in France over the telemonitoring, where for a while the rules were very supportive of telemonitoring and many, many telemonitored units were in the market there. But at the moment, it's still in a sort of a government legal case while they decide what their future policy is going to be, but the market there is again, stable and moving along well. And Germany is also moving well, both our home care business has been winning business and also our wholesale business there is working well. So Germany is moving well. Call out a highlight -- the UK has been very strong and some of our market development programs there are really gaining traction. And the basic fundamentals of the benefit of treating sleep apnea is so well understood in the healthcare system there that we're seeing good progress. Operator : And your next question comes from Chris Kallos from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Chris Kallos : Brett, just to clarify, the adverse product mix in the U.S., you are suggesting that the success of the flow generators being a low-margin product has impacted the margin. Is that clear -- is that what you're saying? Brett Sandercock : Yes, that's correct. Chris Kallos : And just the other question I had was just can we get an update on Astral? How that's tracking? Brett Sandercock : Sure, Chris. We'll take a broader view on that. Astral has had a good two or three quarters of runway in our European markets. And in those markets, Chris, we have more than a decade of established partnerships on the pulmonary critical care discharge from the hospital to home care environment. So Astral is seeing very good success and as Rob just sort of went into detail a little bit around France, Germany, UK and beyond in Western Europe. In the U.S. market, we launched it later. We launched it sort of in the August-September time frame. And in the U.S. market particularly, we're still developing the respiratory care channel and our strength and capability to sell into that. Having said that, we have many thousands of customers in the U.S. and all of them are now aware that ResMed has a life support ventilator, that it's called Astral and that it has some great benefits, such as giving freedom back to patients or the battery that can extend up to 24 hours away from home. So giving freedom back to their patients. So we think there are some great sort of unique selling propositions around it which will give us over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years, frankly, an opportunity to grow that business in that geography. So we're excited about Astral as a long term sustainable opportunity for us to drive high-margin flow generator growth. Operator : Next your question comes from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sean Laaman : Guys, I'm wondering if you can just talk about the pricing strategy on U.S. devices, particularly compared to the prior corresponding period. Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Sean, we haven't made any dramatic changes to our pricing strategy. The biggest thing we're seeing in pricing in the U.S., as we've discussed on the call, is the grandfathering in of some changes we made to our pricing approach last year at this time. So we're still working through some of the pricing changes we made during Q3 and Q4 of last year and that's grandfathering through. But other than that, we haven't made any dramatic changes to pricing. Sean Laaman : And just one follow-up. Were there any sort of lumpy contracts in the U.S. device business sort of won or lost during the quarter compared to the prior corresponding period? Thanks. Mick Farrell : But we don't go into details on a customer basis. It just doesn't make sense to go into that level of detail for competitive reasons on a public conference call like this. Thanks for the question, but we really can't answer that. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham. Please go ahead. Mike Matson : I guess I just wanted to go back to the gross margin. I know you mentioned the various factors that affected it, but I was just wondering -- if one, if you could quantify those. I know some of my other companies will talk about specific basis point impacts for currency, pricing, etcetera. And if you can't get into that level of detail, can you at least kind of prioritize them and tell us which ones -- what had the greatest, the least impact on the gross margin? Brett Sandercock : Mike, we don't get quite as granular as that, but on those ones that I've mentioned, they all had -- if you looked at it year-on-year, they all had meaningful impact on the gross margin. Clearly, a mention on the FX impact which was quite large and then product and geographic mix had a quite large impact as well. And then [indiscernible] declines year-on-year also that we've been discussing. All of them were kind of meaningful contributors to that gross margin decline. Mike Matson : Okay. But would you say pricing -- I mean, I think investors are going to be concerned about pricing. And given these other factors, just wondering if you could -- was the pricing kind of equivalent to these other things? Was it more; was it less than the other factors taken individually? Brett Sandercock : They are all meaningful and not -- there wasn't any particular one that overwhelmed the rest, let me put it that way, that were kind of all there in the mix which is really unusual for us to have almost all of them as a headwind. So it's not like any of them were completely driving it, but when you take them as a sum total, then that adds up to quite a large contraction that we saw. Mike Matson : Okay. And then just on the SERVE-HF clinical data. So when that comes out, assuming data is strong and positive, how do we think about -- think through the impact of that on your business, on your flow generators? I guess it would ultimately translate into sales of the -- I can't think of the name it of now -- but the SV product. MSV or whatever it's called product. And what's the timing of that? Do you expect that to kind of pick up immediately? Pick up just in Europe first? Do you have to get some additional indications approved through the FDA in the U.S. before you can really market it for the heart failure patient population, etcetera? Mick Farrell : SERVE-HF is a multiyear journey for us going back a number of years. And we expect that sort of first publication of the trial results before the end of the calendar year. You know, that's almost the starting gun that would go off on a long journey, Mike. And there are multiple outcomes in a trial like this. There is the outcome that could improve cardiovascular outcomes. There's an outcome that could improve bigger things, like morbidity or mortality in intention and trade versus per protocol analyses. And so many analyses that the primary investigators will have to do from when they crack the code all the way through to when they present the results and then later publish them in a peer reviewed published journal. So there's a long lead time. To your point, it will benefit the business. Mike, I find the easier brand to remember is PaceWave. So the PaceWave product will be picking up from that. And studies both used PaceWave SERVE-HF and the CAT-HF. So we're excited to have that sort of proprietary technology included in the trial. But it's a long journey from there. And so you won't see an immediate inflection point the day of presentation at whichever cardiology conference it may be. What you'll see is the starting gun go off on a marathon opportunity for us which goes over multiple quarters and multiple years. And really, a lot of it comes down to changing standard-of-care country by country, hospital by hospital, payer by payer and, frankly, cardiology and pulmonary group by cardiology and pulmonary group and getting them to partner across hospitals and we see it as a great long term opportunity for us. Mike Matson : Okay. And just in the U.S., is there anything from a regulatory standpoint you're going to need to do once that data is out? Or can you just go ahead and begin to target the U.S. heart failure market as well? Mick Farrell : Well, in the U.S., our indication for use to treat central sleep apnea, periodic breathing and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. So we'll be focusing on that in the U.S. In other markets in different parts of the world, there will be different approaches of working with cardiology groups. But in the U.S., it will be focused on what we do in treating these very severe types of sleep disorder breathing amongst chronic disease patients. Operator : And our next question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. Please go ahead. David Stanton : I wonder if you could give us an update on your views in terms of overall market growth rates in the U.S. and Europe? Where do think that's accelerating from the 4% to 6% that you previously talked about, given the strong growth that we've seen in this quarter and previous quarters as well. That's my first question. Thanks. Mick Farrell : David, look, it's really hard being the only public company that sort of talks on a 90-day cycle here about growth rates to get details of the market growth rates. We talk about it in the mid-single digits in the U.S. and Western Europe. I think there certainly are regions and countries where you're getting double-digit growth, mostly in the emerging markets. We talked earlier about China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe, where we're really partnering with our channel and focusing on growth in those areas. And then you get some opportunities, like we have with Air Solutions and what it has driven in great value to customers. And you get some share gains as part of that as well. Has market growth tipped up a little because we're moving to connected care models and we're partnering with integrated delivery networks and accountable care organizations? I would say it's a little early for that traction to have started to really move the market in growth. I think that's more of a longer-term story, as you look out sort of one year, three years, five years, where you'll start to see us be able to influence market growth by the great solutions we're providing to take patients out of hospitals, put them in homes and save money for broken healthcare systems. So I think we're still sort of looking in that mid-single-digit range. But again, it's blurry and there's a lot of multiple data sources to get to that. David Stanton : And I guess my follow-up to that is as it is getting a little bit closer, can you give us sort of your views on where you see the introduction of the third round of competitive bidding in the U.S. for next year? What that will do, perhaps in your eyes to those market growth rates? Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel. Dave Pendarvis : CB3, as it's been announced, is pretty much a known quantity now, so that's a good thing. There's stability and predictability in the market for our U.S. customers. They now know that in January of 2016, there begins a phased process that runs through the middle of the year, where reimbursement will be adjusted. There's still some questions about rural adjustments, where there can be a 110% of the national rates. But by and large, CB3 should be predictable and therefore, business planning can occur with customers knowing what the reimbursement is they're going to face. And without there being a reduction in the number of authorized customers or authorized suppliers in a region, we don't expect the kind of disruption that we saw in the second round of competitive bidding. I'm not sure that that would have a significant impact on growth rates. Obviously, the patients are getting diagnosed and that reimbursement for diagnosis isn't changing. I think our best guess would be that the growth rates would stay roughly the same in those markets that are affected by the third round of competitive bidding. Operator : And your next question comes from William Dunlop from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. William Dunlop : I just wanted to get a little bit more color around the level of competition you're seeing in masks? Mick Farrell : Sure, William. Masks are multiple categories. You have the full-face masks, you have nasal pillows and then you have nasal masks. And in each of those subcategories, there are multiple players in multiple countries competing with their own innovation. What I can tell you is that it is a competitive game. And we're innovating incredibly well and some of our competitors are doing a reasonable job, too. And what that allows is good competition in a market, healthy competition in a market and the opportunity for us and our competitors to present those opportunities to patients, to HME providers and to clinicians and get them excited about what we have. So as you go through each of the categories and you go through each of the countries, you win in some categories and in some countries and then you don't win for a while in some categories and countries. But over the long term, what we've showed at ResMed that of the 7% of our revenues that we invest in research and development, we put a good chunk of that into world-leading mask and patient interface, more generally and accessory research. And we have, I would say, across countries and across the categories some world-leading innovation that's doing very well and more in the pipeline. As I said, we're going to get back to positive growth in our major geographies and around the world on that. And we're confident about that. William Dunlop : And just following on from that, last quarter, you mentioned that you think you probably took market share sequentially in masks. Would you be able to comment on what you think market share did in this quarter? And just finally, are you able to elaborate more on the pipeline that you just mentioned? Mick Farrell : I'll take the second part first. And the answer to that is no. We're not going to go into details on the pipeline. And I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim to talk about relative share that you might've seen, particularly in the U.S. geography. Jim Hollingshead : Yes, I mean, it's a typical member to get to, market share, because there's not terrific data. But based upon what we see in the market, we think the shares are relatively stable and probably we took a little bit of share on the margin in the quarter, but it's very, very difficult to estimate. So if you went with stable shares, you probably wouldn't be far off. William Dunlop : So that implies that the mask market in the U.S. is perhaps going backwards, if you took a little bit of share in the quarter? Mick Farrell : Well you know, you got the difference between unit share and then you've got revenue share. And you've got pricing and many factors into that, William. So one of the things that we've said on these calls is we're not going to go into details of year-on-year price deltas. And so if we start to talk about volumes and exactly where that's at, then everyone can reverse engineer the pricing, including competitors or others who may be reading the transcript or listening to this call. William, I appreciate where you're going in the drill down, but I think we're going to have to go to the next question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Low : Brett, if I could just start with a quick one on other income line. I was wondering if you could talk what's in that? Is it largely FX hedge gain? Brett Sandercock : Yes, the majority of that is some FX hedge gains and that was largely around our other euro hedging structures, yes. David Low : And just the only other one I had was with the very strong sales growth you saw in the U.S. devices. Just wondering if you are on backorder or whether you've been able to fully supply those orders? Mick Farrell : No, David, we're off backorder in the U.S.. Flow generators and that's a really good thing. The downside of that, as Brett said is that we're doing a lot more air freight than we would like at this time. And so as we start to -- and Brett and Don and the team in Sydney are really getting the factory there, both there and in Singapore, moving. So we will expect to start to move from air freight to sea freight. And as Brett said earlier, to start those cost-out programs over the coming quarters to get us back on track there. But no, we were not on backorder this quarter which is a good thing. Operator : And the next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Maybe to focus in on U.S. flow gens as well. Just trying to get a sense of AirCurve in the quarter or were there any large stocking orders on the bilevels in the quarter? I know it was launched late last quarter, so was just wondering the extent of the impact in this quarter? And then a follow-up. Mick Farrell : Jim, do you want to take the question about the orders? Do you know how it impacted inventory-wise or replacements? Jim Hollingshead : It's not something we have perfect visibility into, but I didn't see anything unusual in the quarter in terms of stocking orders. The year got off to a really good start since its launch and so it's on a really good growth and adoption ramp. And we think we're taking share in that category as well as in APAP and CPAP. But we didn't see anything unusual. Mick Farrell : Yes, I think what you saw last quarter was a good ramp up of the AirSense 10. And what you saw this quarter was a good ramp up of the AirCurve 10 combined with ongoing ramp up of the AirSense 10. You have the addition of Astral, mainly in Europe, but starting to happen in the U.S. geography, Anthony. Anthony Petrone : And then the second one is on CHF. And just trying to get a sense of how this plays out potentially into 2016, specifically from an operational standpoint. So I would imagine some of the R&D expenses will fall off when SERVE-HF is done. So is that the case? And will that be completely offset by reinvestments into the marketing efforts for SERVE-HF or is that a net benefit? Mick Farrell : Yes, good question about SERVE-HF. And as we start to complete that study, what you should realize is usually when these studies go out, there are a number of follow-on publications that look to analyze the data that we've collected over these 5 years to 7 years from different angles to produce different things. And so I would expect ongoing analysis and research, certainly on the buyer statistician side and analysis of the data from investigators and workers on the study. Yes, but certainly the day-to-day recruitment of patients does slow down as you move off those studies. But one thing about ResMed, Anthony, is that we take a long term view and we invest for the long term. And so the growing needs and opportunities for us in healthcare informatics, for instance, are an area that we're investing in and we'll continue to ramp up our investment. The growing opportunities to develop channels and research around COPD and the mortality rate that you saw in the current line study that we talked about two quarters ago, where you have a 76% relative reduction in mortality for COPD patients treated with noninvasive ventilation. I mean, there are so many opportunities for research in the COPD side that I wouldn't -- if I was running your model for FY '16, I wouldn't be pulling out R&D dollars for ResMed. I would say ResMed is going to reinvest and keep that sort of 5 year, 10 year, 15 year view that clinical research drives market development, drives market growth and drives value for patients. And that's something that we focus on for the long term. Operator : And your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Saul Hadassin : Brett, just a question on operating cash flow. I think I heard you right. You mentioned for the quarter, it was around $91 million or $90.9 million. Just wondering if you could give us what that might have been in constant currency or what the FX impact was? Because that looks like it's down fairly materially on the PCP. And just a follow-up to that question is just what's happening on the receivables side in terms of trading terms? That would be great. Thanks. Brett Sandercock : Yes, I'll take the first one on receivables on the sort of -- our days sales and trading terms, they were pretty consistent with where they've been kind of this time last year and over the last few quarters. So I think that's been pretty stable. On the operating cash flow front, yes, it's down on PCP. But around the euro and the decline and so on, that would certainly hurt us a little bit on the cash flow front. But you've got to be a bit cautious, because they are 90 day snapshots on the cash flow. I think I prefer to look at it more of a longer-term trend on the cash flow. So PCP was down a little bit. I think overall, the cash flow remains quite strong, although yes, probably hurt a little bit on the FX front. Operator : And your next question comes from Craig Collie from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Craig Collie : Two for me. The first, just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of the very impressive flow gen growth number. Mick, could you perhaps give us a little bit of flavor as to the waitings of some of the separate drivers, in particular share gains from, I guess, new patients being diagnosed with sleep apnea versus the installed base upgrading versus perhaps bilevels and cardiorespiratory cells? Mick Farrell : Yes, I mean, to the comments I made earlier, clearly, a number of 42% in the U.S. geography, given the large base we have there, is exceptional. And it's exceptionally good, but it is exceptional and it did include a big chunk of share gain that we would know. To delve out exactly what was market growth versus share gain growth, I'll leave the mathematics of that up to you and the other experts on the call. But as I look to the sustainability of the long term underlying growth there, I think it is there in that good solid mid-single-digit market growth that we talked about. The difference between AirSense 10 which is in its third quarter, I guess, of real moving up that S-curve of launch and AirCurve 10 which is just finishing its first full quarter and then you add in Astral which is got, for the U.S. market, a much longer penetration curve to go, you can sort of get into some pretty complex calculations as to exactly what shares they'll be. What we're focused on is really the long term, Craig. We're absolutely taking share in sleep disorder breathing, but more importantly than that, we're switching the industry to focus on healthcare informatics as a value play. That taking data to the cloud is not enough. You have to then take that data and provide solutions for your customers, to take cost out of the channel, to get efficiencies. And for patients, physicians and providers to all get real-time data so that they can make their businesses better, make the patients better and improve outcomes and so it's sort of a long term gain versus, for us, let's analyze the 90 days and look at it. And I think what the milestone of that 42% says the long term game is the right game and it's got some capability. And we should double down our investment in that space. Craig Collie : And then just lastly, any updates on a potential pilot for bundling? Mick Farrell : So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis to talk about bundling associated with CB for future rounds. Dave Pendarvis : It's really been no news on that front. So you know, the situation remains that there is an initial proposal from CMS, that they suggested they might run a bundling pilot. There are no more details on what that pilot might look like, when, if at all, it would go into effect. And we've just heard nothing else. So really no developments on that front. Operator : Yes, we will now turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Great. Well, thanks, Adrienne. In closing, I would like to thank the more than 4000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing millions of lives, literally with every breath. We certainly remain inspired by our long term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time today. We hope to see many of you at our ResMed Investor Day which we're holding this June 2015 in San Francisco. More details from Agnes on that later. Agnes Lee : Yes. And thank you all for joining us again today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available in the investor relations section of our website at resmed.com. Okay, Adrienne, you can close now. Operator : This concludes ResMed's third quarter earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Kelly, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Kelly, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today, are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners now that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our Q4 and our full fiscal year 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we finished our fiscal year with robust performance in both our core sleep apnea business and our respiratory care business as well as a return to solid growth for our mask products. In my remarks I'll discuss our top and bottom line results, regional highlights from our global business, and an update regarding our long-term strategy. I'll also provide high level summaries of two recent acquisitions, first CareTouch, a healthcare informatics acquisition that we announced just a few weeks ago; and second, an investment that we made and announced just earlier today, a few minutes ago, it went over the wire with Curative Medical. Finally I'll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail, and then we'll get to Q&A. As you saw in our press release, our global team achieved double-digit revenue growth up 17% on a constant currency basis during the quarter. This is our best performance in over four years, and quite an achievement on the robust foundation of the $1.7 billion global business. Our team performed incredibly well. In our Americas region we achieved double-digit revenue growth, and in our combined European and Asia Pac region we achieved solid mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. These global results were fueled by the success of our new product and solutions launches in both our sleep and respiratory care businesses. Looking at the bottom line, our diluted EPS was $0.68 on a non-GAAP basis. Our global team produced excellent top line growth this quarter, and we have been balancing our investments in growth opportunities while managing costs in R&D and SG&A. As you look ahead to our fiscal year 2016, we believe that we can achieve further operating leverage in both R&D and SG&A. Brett will talk about gross margin guidance in more detail in his remarks, but I would like to outline three areas for efficiency that are critical to our FY 2016 plans. First, we are moving more and more of our shipping volume from air freight to sea freight as we continue to ramp our product launches. Second, we are reducing supply chain costs with significant and sustained internal and external cost-out programs throughout FY 2016. And third, we continue to grow incremental manufacturing volume in our lower cost plants. In addition, we have also established sales plans for accelerated growth in our high margin products throughout FY 2016 and beyond, including the AirCurve 10 variable platform and the Astral Life Support Ventilation platform. Okay. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas we had strong performance in Q4 sales, with the commercial team driving 27% year-on-year growth. Our team achieved phenomenal flow gen related growth of over 50% for the quarter. This exceptional result was driven by the ongoing success of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 platforms, and it was powered by our Healthcare Informatics solutions, including AirView, U-Sleep, and myAir. We also saw ongoing customer adoption as we continue to expand our Life Support Ventilation business in the Americas with the Astral platform. We achieved good mask growth in the quarter with our AirFit portfolio, and it's important to note that pricing in this mask category is in a good place. We continue to expect solid Mask and Accessories category growth over the next year. Moving on to our combined European and Asia Pac region, we grew at 5% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators in Europe, again driven by the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10 and the Astral platforms as well as robust growth in our Masks and our Accessories businesses. The big news for the Asia Pac group this quarter is our investment in the expansion of our China business. I'll talk more about the Curative Medical acquisition in a few moments. Let me now roll up to a broader perspective to discuss the progress we have made against our long-term growth plans, our three horizons of growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth, which encompasses our core sleep apnea market, we have continued to drive Healthcare Informatics solutions that meet our customers' needs for efficiency, patient adherence and improved outcomes. Our recent acquisition of CareTouch allows us to add key features to our resupply offerings. CareTouch is a provider of Internet-based solutions and resupply programs for the home care industry. This technology provides an easy use solution for managing patient populations with patient engagement algorithms and an automated IVR outreach as well as a live, multilingual call center. We have rebranded this offering as ResMed Resupply. We will continue to serve current CareTouch customers and expand this offering so that it's available to all our HME partners. As you heard at our Investor Day in San Francisco a few months ago from Raj Sodhi, the President of our Healthcare Informatics business, we now have established Healthcare Informatics as a core competence for ResMed. We will continue to build HI capabilities and buy them when appropriate so that we can drive channel efficiencies, unlock cost savings and ultimately improve patient outcomes. We also continue our ongoing efforts to build market awareness regarding the importance of sleep and sleep apnea during the quarter. We announced in the press release results from a study on our consumer wellness offering, the S+ by ResMed. The study showed that after one week of use 67% of S+ users with low baseline sleep scores achieved an improvement of an average 30 minutes of extra sleep per night. We are excited that our first consumer sleep wellness offer has achieved these results. The more consumers become aware of the importance of sleep and aware of any risky breathing or suffocation they have during the night, the better for addressing the vast majority of sleep apnea sufferers who are still not aware of their condition and have not yet seen a doctor about their problem. During the quarter we also announced a $5 million donation for medical research into sleep apnea and COPD to help create a Center for Excellence in this field at the University of California, San Diego. UCSD is a leading academic research institution located just a few miles from our global headquarters here in California. We believe that academic industry partnerships like this are critical to the ongoing innovation in the fields of both sleep and respiratory medicine. Moving on to our second horizon of growth, we are making solid progress on two fronts : list of free care market development, and ongoing investment in our high growth markets. We continue to grow our European Respiratory Care business from the strong base that we have developed over the last decade, since our acquisition of Saime in Europe in 2005. Our Americas region is fast following suit, fueled primarily by the Astral product offering. There is a very long global runway ahead for our life support, ventilation and our non-invasive ventilation solutions to help both COPD as well as neuromuscular disease patients. The Curative Medical acquisition that we announced earlier today hits on our strategy and horizon to both vectors. It grows our respiratory care product portfolio by adding current and existing and future ventilation products, and it also takes us to a leadership position in the geography in the high growth respiratory medical device market in China. Curative provides a complementary product portfolio for ResMed in both sleep apnea and respiratory care. ResMed and Curative offerings serve different customer segments through complementary channels. Together we have the broadest portfolio of innovative sleep apnea and ventilation devices, from premium imported devices to locally designed and manufactured product offerings that are tailored for the needs of the China market. We plan to continue to invest in both R&D and manufacturing in China for the Curative brand. We will maintain separate brands and distribution channels in order to quickly respond to the needs of the full spectrum of customer segments in China. Our Curative acquisition is an example of us putting our capital to work. We will continue to invest in China, India, Brazil, Eastern Europe and other key, high growth markets in medical devices. We will execute on long-term strategies that are tailored to each individual country while improving patient outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs. Our third horizon of growth includes a spectrum of cardio-respiratory conditions. We expect presentation of the SERVE-HF results by the study's primary investigators in a few months. Without going into too much detail on SERVE-HF, I would like to say that I am very proud of the global ResMed team and how we dealt with the SERVE-HF study. Our ethics and integrity was on full show. We made patient safety the most important priority. I believe that we have built credibility with patients, providers, cardiologists and our core sleep pulmonary and critical care physicians. That only adds to the ResMed brand. Subsequent quotes and discussions with key opinion leaders, both publicly and privately, have provided strength for this belief. We follow the data and we do the right thing. To this point you will see in the published results some interesting insights. For example, as discussed by our Chief Medical Officer at the APSS Conference in Seattle just a few months ago, as ejection fraction increases, there is an increasing trend towards benefit from ventilation therapy even amongst the third HF group. We will continue to monitor our heart failure patients in our U.S. based heart failure trial, which is called CAT-HF. Longer-term we see further adjacent opportunities in cardiology in heart failure but also in atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. I'll provide more regarding our ongoing cardiovascular strategy during our next quarterly call. We remain active on the capital management front. This quarter, our board has declared an increase of our dividend by 7% to $0.30 per share. And we are continuing with our share purchase program. You will hear more from Brett in just a few moments. On the M&A front, we continue to look at acquisition opportunities that meet these three criteria : first, the business is aligned with our long-term growth strategy; second, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed shareholder value; and third, that there is a cultural fit between the leader of the business and ResMed in our innovation culture. We found two great companies that meet all three of these criteria recently; CareTouch and Curative Medical. We will continue to seek further opportunities as appropriate. Let me close with this. We remain excited about our performance, our near-term outlook and our long-term three horizons growth strategy. We are the global leaders in sleep and respiratory medicine not just in market share, but more importantly, in product, service, channel and market innovation. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly, for our patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q4 and full-year financials. Brett? Brett Sandercock : All right. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the June quarter was $453.1 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weak euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $32.5 million in the fourth quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $273.7 million, an increase of 27% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe and Asia Pacific totaled $179.4 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter. But in constant currency terms, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking up revenue between product segments, Americas flow generator sales were $151.5 million, an increase of 53% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122.2 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in Europe and Asia Pacific, flow generator sales were $121.1 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior-year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Revenue growth in Europe and Asia Pacific was lower mostly due to lower ASP sales and a tough prior year comparable for Asia Pacific, reflecting typical lumpy order cycles. Masks and other sales were $58.3 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 6%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 25% while masks and other increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we incurred a one-time charge of $5 million associated with a field safety notice expenses in the response to the result of the SERVE-HF clinical trial. Additionally, we made donations totaling $6 million, which comprised of $5 million dollar donation to the University of California, San Diego, and a one-off incremental donation of $1 million to the ResMed Foundation. All of these charges have been excluded in non-GAAP numbers. In addition, the non-GAAP measures exclude amortization of acquired intangibles in the current year and restructuring expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles in the prior-year quarter. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers is included in our fourth quarter earnings press release. My subsequent commentary will reference non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP gross margins for the June quarter was 68.4%, lower than guidance, essentially due to product and geographic mix, notably the strong performance in America's flow generator style and the impact of lower ASP sales as a result of the SERVE-HF trial outcome. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 450 basis points, reflecting adverse currency movements, unfavorable geographic mix, unfavorable product mix and declines in average selling prices. Looking forward in fiscal year 2016, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 60% assuming current exchange rates. Now I'd like to spend a little time just walking through the drivers of our gross margin guidance. We are assuming that average selling prices remain relatively stable with a normal level of modest decline as we recycle the price change we made in the first half of fiscal year 2014. Our range does assume that we continue to have relative out-performance in America's flow-generated growth, which is positive to the top line but will have a negative price and geographic mix impact on our gross margin in fiscal year 2016. It also factors in the product mix impact associated with the expected reduction in ASV revenue. To the extent we continue to see out-performance in the America's flow generator growth, we would expect to move towards the lower end of our guidance range. However, as I said at our recent Investor Day, we're working very hard on our cost-out programs which include the benefit of shifting from air freight to sea freight as well as a pipeline of cost-out initiatives in the areas of procurement, production and logistics. The benefit to these programs will be realized over the course of fiscal year 2016 and will have a positive impact on our gross margin. Finally in terms of currency impacts on gross margin, the recent depreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar will continue to be a headwind in Q1, however there will be a positive benefit from the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which will be reflected in our gross margin from the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $123.5 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 12%, primarily due to higher available employee compensation, the impact of recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27.2% compared to the year-ago figure of 29.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.5 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter; or in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.7%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, Informatics Solutions, and clinical trials, but also the benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.1 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $13.1 million. On a non-GAAP basis our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 17.8%, and for the full fiscal year 2015 our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.5%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2016 will be in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $96.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $87.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.68, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro and partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 11% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $99.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.2 million while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $17.7 million. We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, representing an increase of 7% over the previous quarterly dividend. Additionally during the quarter, we repurchased 941,000 shares for consideration of 55.9 million. And for fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for consideration of 152.6 million. At the end of June, we had approximately 15.5 million shares remaining under our authorized repurchase program. In addition as Mick outlined, we announced the acquisition of Curative Medical and expect the transaction to close before the end of calendar year 2015. We've not disclosed the financial terms of the transaction. In fiscal year 2015, we've returned 97% of free cash flow to our shareholders, live dividends and repurchases, and over the last five years, we've returned 98% of free cash flow to our shareholders, live dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $417 million, and at June 30, title assets put up $2.2 billion, and net equity was $1.6 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A, and we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Kelly, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you, we will not begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much for taking my call. Terrific results. Could I perhaps just ask the effect or just to characterize the effect of ASP from the safety recall just with a \u2013 we saw already trend lines I guess particularly around people with a normal heart function who might have complex sleep apnea. Brett Sandercock : Thanks, Andrew, for the call. And I agree with you, it was a good quarter. With regard to SERVE-HF and the follow-up from that, the results these last months since we published the SERVE-HF results all had been presented by our Chief Medical Officer at the conferences and discussed them with regulators, the publication will be in a couple months, have been pretty much in line with the information that we put out there. And so we said that ASP accounts for around 7% of our revenues and about a quarter of that is potentially in this affected population. So we're talking about impact of less than 1.75% of our group sales. And that's sort of the trend line that we've seen approximately in that range over the last months since the data were published on the trial. Interestingly, our ASP business in narcotic-induced central sleep apnea or treatment emergent central sleep apnea has not been affected, and that's mostly in the U.S. side of the business and it's an opportunity for us to grow that what they sometimes call complex sleep apnea or treatment emergent central sleep apnea opportunity in Europe. Andrew Goodsall : And with the \u2013 I know you described Europe as having some impact for ASP. Would there be any reason why Europe is perhaps a little bit more difficult post the safety notice in Europe than perhaps the U.S.? Brett Sandercock : Yeah, thanks for the follow-up, Andrew. And yes, since we had run the SERVE-HF trial predominantly in Europe, there were some sites in Asia Pac, but mostly in Europe, and had been a big focus on the heart failure component that the majority of the ASP effect has been within the European region. Andrew Goodsall : Perfect. And [indiscernible] just really quick housekeeping, just the FX effect of the net income level from Brett? Brett Sandercock : Yeah, on the FX impact on EPS this quarter, it was pretty significant. It was around $0.05 negative on EPS. Andrew Goodsall : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Again, your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor. Your line is open. Michael Farrell : Matt, I think you've either got us on mute or you're not there. Let's go to the next question, Kelly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. Your line is open. Ben Andrew : Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two areas for us; Mick, talk a little bit about the durability of the reacceleration in Masks? You had an easy comp obviously in the quarter, but you're getting rid of the price declines. Do you see Masks in the U.S., and you talked a little bit to this in your script, but do you see it getting back to the high-single-digit growth rate durably? Michael Farrell : So good question, Andrew, and yeah it was a great turnaround from Q3 to Q4, from minus 3% to plus 5% on the Masks line. We do think that's a sustainable turnaround for a number of reasons. The AirFit portfolio, particularly the P10 and the F10, are very solid and strong masks and are being received really well by customers. That's point one. And point two is yeah, we annualized those price declines that we talked about from January to June, 2014 through January to June, 2015 so we're through that sort of hurdle. So good products, good pricing, good positioning and we think the masks will continue to do well for the year ahead. Ben Andrew : Okay. And then on the gross margin side, Brett, maybe give us some insights into the relative magnitude of currency, mix, geography, things like that? So whether for Q4 or maybe for 2016 so we can be a little more granular in how we think about that? Thanks. Brett Sandercock : Yeah, Ben. If you look at Q4 year-on-year, and as you know a bunch of drivers on that margin, but if you look at that, the single biggest impact for us was FX. And to put that into perspective, I think it was around sort of that 150 basis point mark. So that was the biggest impact, but each of the others were meaningful in terms of geographic mix, product mix and ASP decline I think all played a part in that. That kind of gives you sort of a relative sense of what was driving the gross margin there. Ben Andrew : And then the guidance again for 2016, is it presumably product mix is a bigger impact? Or is it some of the other things start to go the other way? Is that fair? Brett Sandercock : Yeah, I think that \u2013 yeah. I mean the mix, with the flow generator growth in the U.S., what you're seeing there is quite extraordinary. So it does swing your product mix and your geographic mix somewhat. So they sort of become a little more volatile, if you like. So I think if you were \u2013 I think it will run through fiscal year 2016, I think some of those will tend to moderate as kind of your cycle price introduction and so on. As you know we're working very hard on cost-out programs, and they will deliver. The timing will be uncertain but they'll deliver over the course of 2016. And then currencies, okay, that's always a bit of a wild card, but we've seen some depreciation in the Aussie dollar recently. We haven't seen the benefit of that yet, tends to lag about a quarter. Really we'll start to see some of that benefiting in Q2 as well. So I mean some of the \u2013 certainly a lot of those drivers that were working against us will certainly I think moderate over the course of 2016. But again, they're quite volatile so the kind of the gross margins guidance would be a little bit wider, I think that really accounts for some of the volatility we're seeing in some of the drivers. Ben Andrew : Okay. Michael Farrell : Ben, I'd just add to that, to Brett's comments which I agree with all of them, and I don't want to sound like a broken record but I'll reiterate what we're doing the next 12 months on this, we're moving from air freight to sea freight as these products ramp up. We're moving these cost-out programs in the supply chain, so that's with suppliers and our partners but also within our internal programs and manufacturing and COGS reduction. And thirdly, we're increasing the incremental growth at lower cost plants. And I think all those three elements will help move GM to the higher end of Brett's guidance rather than the low one. And then finally, our sales teams, Jim and Ann and their teams are being provided incentives to drive high gross margin growth. So growth in the AirCurve 10 range, growth in the Astral range, and growth in the AirFit range of masks all being provided incentives to the channel to make sure that we grow those high GMx products. And so all those together I think are a pretty powerful weapon. Ben Andrew : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Great. Thanks. Maybe just to focus in on SERVE-HF and just cardiology, I'm wondering, Mick, maybe if you can resize the opportunity post the SERVE-HF results here, it seems there's still certainly an opportunity in the less sick patient population. I'm just wondering if there's any numbers that you can share with us around that? The follow-up to that would be is there an update on timing in getting to that patient population? And then lastly on this topic, which could be an update on CAT-HF? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. So to seize the opportunity in HF globally, we're in the U.S. with more than 8 million patients and globally there are more than 20 million patients with heart failure worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea progress in that group is north of 40%, we think central sleep apnea is around 30%. SERVE-HF was targeted at the 30%. If you look at all the key opinion leaders post SERVE-HF and their comments around both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea in general, is obstructive sleep apnea should be treated with all co-morbidities, and the SERVE-HF results have no impact on that area. I might go into some information in some publications that have come out from ATS in the American Journal for Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, on that front if we need to, but certainly that's what the key opinion leaders are saying. That's what we've seen in practice as we look at our sales over the last sort of 60, 90 days since the SERVE-HF results have come out. So as we look forward we think there's still a significant opportunity in heart failure with the obstructive sleep apnea patients. And amongst the central sleep apnea patients, which is the 30% prevalent side, physicians are still trying to work out what to do, whether it's just CPAP or a combination of oxygen and CPAP or bi-level, and they're working through each of those modalities. And I think you'll see a lot of research in the area to go closer to HF to next steps. We are working with Chris O'Connor and the group at CAT-HF to certainly finish and follow through on the patients who are already in that trial. And Rob and I just had a teleconference with Chis O'Connor a couple of days ago, and we're planning for next steps post HF and post CAT-HF, how do we find the groups of patients who are well treated and we can really focus on health economics, keeping patients out of hospital beyond that 30-day, 90-day period with heart failure, which is such a focus, and their functional outcomes as steps that we look ahead for post CAT-HF and post SERVE-HF. And as I said in the preliminary remarks, we're in the field of play here. We'll give you an update next quarter as to where we are with our cardiovascular strategy, but we're not moving away from this area. In fact, we're likely to double down on it because as you'll see, the results from SERVE-HF come out with some pretty interesting insights as you look at the different quintiles and the different groups of patients. But I'm not going to say too much more on that because I'm going to wait for the data to be published in the period review article, and then I can start to talk about the market opportunities that have part of that. Thanks for the question, Anthony. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Wheen : Good morning. Just a quick question on the margin again; you mentioned the various factors, Brett, that were impacting it. One of them is the ASP, the ongoing ASP declines. You're obviously seeing a rebasing of pricing in masks now that it's returned to growth, so is there, can you just sort of talk to the think pressure you're seeing across the flow generators, which I assume is where that is coming from? Brett Sandercock : Yeah, I mean, the ASP declines was year-on-year, Steve, so still cycling a little bit of that kind of second half impact, but we're basically through that now. So we do think the impacts from ASP declines will certainly moderate from where they've been. And that's kind of being factored into the guidance. As Mick said, we're seeing a relatively stable environment, I guess, on the pricing at the moment, and that's kind of across the whole product range really. Steve Wheen : Okay. And then, some commentary that you made last quarter was that you'd be expecting to be not as reliant on air freighting. Did that not pan out as you expected just because of the sheer uptick in volume that you saw in flow generators? Are we still seeing that sort of impact on the gross margin from air freight? Brett Sandercock : Yeah, true. We haven't been able to get, basically move from air freight to sea freight quite as quickly as we would have liked. And you saw it just in the latest quarter. When you look at it, frankly the flow gen growth has been accelerating through the quarters. This quarter you saw 50% growth in the U.S., which is quite phenomenal. But the guys have really done a great job in making sure we've got the capacity there and that product is going out to market quite seamlessly. But we've been doing that with obviously more air freight than we would like. Based on the trend down it was kind of where we're looking at July that I'm quite happy with how we're trending that now. But I do think that will start to see meaningful benefit I think coming through in Q2 on the freight out program. The trajectory and the trend is absolutely there, so I'm quite confident we'll see that; likely to be Q2 impact at this stage. Steve Wheen : Yeah. And just to be clear, that air freight cost is sitting in your gross margin, not in your SG&A line? And if you can just cover off on whether or not because of that demand in flow generators you've got any unfilled orders? Brett Sandercock : Yeah, so definitely it's in our gross margin, the freight. The \u2013 and we don't, no, we would have finished the quarter pretty much with negligible back orders. Steve Wheen : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior from Evans & Partners. Your line is open. Matthew Prior : All right, guys. Great results. Just two questions; first one from me is Mick, just in terms of the U.S. sales and the great flow gen result, where are we in terms of the Astral product cycle and ramp-up given that \u2013 I'm just wondering with the strong U.S. flow gen result and the uptake of Informatics if we're focused a little bit too much on the sleep side of the business? And you may be having success in ventilation in Astral in the U.S. that's somewhat covered up I guess in the focus on that number. Michael Farrell : Well, Matthew, the U.S. flow generators numbers includes both sleep and respiratory care products, but the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 are the vast majority of it. But I'll hand it over to Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to maybe give a little more color on the growth of our Astral line of respiratory care and the flow generator, the amazing growth in the line's growth for the quarter. James Hollingshead : Yeah, we've had great flow generator growth across the entire quarter. Specifically your question on Astral, it's still early days on Astral. And so that's still ramping, but it's so far, exceeding our expectations. The device is quite a good device. It's very strong clinically and it has very high ease of use. And so we're very happy, we're very pleased with the adoption of Astral. It's ahead of expectations. Matthew Prior : All right. Thanks. And just a second question from me. Mick, in terms of Informatics, can you talk whether the Informatics roll-out and uptake has driven any mask resupply styles increase in terms of that important metric, and whether that aided you in the fourth quarter with U.S. mask sales? And also just ask are you seeing any re-tapping on the back of Informatics' success? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Good questions, Matt. The Healthcare Informatics core competency, the capability their view, U-Sleep and myAir has really enabled us to achieve those flow generator growth numbers. The analogy would be iTunes is such a great platform that people are buying a lot of iPhones and iPads, and so we do think that the growth of those flow generators is linked to really the changing of the basis of competition in our industry from just smaller, quieter, more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected. And that more connected element is the Informatics that liberates the data, unlocks values for patients, providers and physicians and, ultimately, hospital systems. Your question, your sort of part two of the question was is there a link to the Q4 masks number? And I'd say, no, no, just yes, right? The acquisition of Jaysec earlier this fiscal year and CareTouch that we announced just earlier this month, both will enable us to use those data to drive resupply programs and to get them out to all the HMEs and make available to all the HMEs. We think there's still a huge opportunity to contact patients and let them know how far up they are along in their mask gauging and give them an opportunity to buy. So I think as you look forward over FY 2016 and beyond, there's a huge opportunity for Informatics to drive mask sales, but it wasn't really there in Q4. And the re-tapping opportunity again, I'd say that's not in the historic, that's in the future. And we do have an opportunity to reach out to patients through the Informatics solution, to e-mail, text or IVR to patients on coaching and adherence, and that could lead to reaching out our masks and on re-tapping. So you'll hear more from us over the coming fiscal year, and we can give you an update next quarter as to the link between Informatics and driving those trialing revenues. But it's a huge opportunity for us and for our channel and for the patients. Matthew Prior : All right. Thanks, guys. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Du from CBA. Your line is open. Bruce Du : Hi, guys. I just firstly was following up on the ASV question prior. You touched on sort of the impact in Europe, so I was sort of just wondering whether or not you've seen or probably expect to see the next couple of quarters any impact in terms of demand out of Asia. And I know you sort of mentioned that Japan in the past has been quite a lumpy market, but this thing could take up there? Michael Farrell : Yeah, Bruce. Well, I'll hand it to Rob Douglas to talk about the impacts on ASV in Asia Pac. Rob, do you want to take that? Robert Douglas : Yeah, definitely. We've talked quite a lot that the ASV's been very successful, and there have been a lot of local trials in Japan. In various patient populations, there's an incredible amount of support for the ASV in Japan. Given the different regulator environments in that, the Japanese regulators are moving at a very deliberate pace towards analyzing and understanding what this has been and what it all means, but we expect there still to be significant interest in Japan. And in the short-term Japan remains, still because of the nature of the market, we have variable demand on a quarter-to-quarter basis for Japan. So it's a little bit hard to measure that exactly at this stage. Michael Farrell : The only thing I'd add to Rob's comments, which I agree with them, is that in Japan ASV is often used in an acute setting. Robert Douglas : Yeah. Michael Farrell : The SERVE-HF results were done in a chronic setting, and so the physicians there are working through the difference of application between acute and chronic care, and there are different clinical implications. And more will come out post the publication of the SERVE-HF data on that in the coming months. Thanks for the question, Bruce. Bruce Du : Okay. Great. And I just had one more, it was just around clarifying is it correct that the non-invasive ventilation is now out of competitive bidding, the upcoming round? Michael Farrell : I'll hand to Dave Pendarvis to answer that. David Pendarvis : Yup. Short answer is yes, Bruce, that the next rounds of competitive bidding will not include non-invasive ventilation. There was an initial proposal that it would, and the announcement after that, that it's not included in competitive bidding, which our customers feel good about and we feel good about. Bruce Du : Okay. Excellent. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping to start with the \u2013 a follow-up to a previous question on the Informatics. Mick, just as you think about where that product line can go going forward, I think we're probably low-single-digits in terms of market share at this point, but just how that market's going to segment itself over the next several years between the real high end featured products including Informatics versus kind of your average mid-to-low feature set and then the low end as well? Michael Farrell : Yeah, Matthew. The impact on revenue of the Informatics is really through the rest of the business. So if you think of Informatics really as an enabler or a new basis of enabling our HME providers, our patients and our physicians to get access to data. So physicians can access data in AirView, patients can access it in myAir, and then through electronic data interchange we're able to put the data into Epic or Cerner systems for hospitals and even payer providers so they can leverage that data. So the monetary, you're talking about what percentage of the revenue, the monetary feedback directly from payments for the Informatics Solutions is de minimis and it's not material. But the enabling of the sales, such as the 53% growth in flow generators in the quarter in the Americas, was really fueled and catalyzed and powered by those Healthcare Informatics solutions. So we do have internal calculations of the value of Informatics to justify our ongoing investment in that space, but it's a really long-term play about showing the value of home care, of taking sick patients out of hospital, putting them in a home and saving money for broken healthcare systems that's there. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Sorry, Mick, I think I wasn't real clear on the question. It wasn't a function of what kind of revenue can you get from the Informatics. It was more of a function of if you don't offer Informatics on your CPAP system, are you just not going to be able to participate in the segment of the market, and will that segment of the market be 25%, 30% of all CPAPs being sold in a few years. Michael Farrell : That's a good question. Thanks for the clarification, Matthew. Look, I think that it'll first be 100% of the market that you require data because what's happening is what we're doing is if you look at the data that's in our investor deck there, the published data that we put out there on the product called U-Sleep, where we showed a 59% reduction in the labor costs for the HME upon using U-Sleep and an increase in adherence from 73% to 83%. You start to run the economics for our customer, and it's going to become just an essential basis of competition to play. But I want to make it clear that Informatics is not Informatics. It's not just saying, well I can get my data to the cloud. It's doing it fast, securely, enabling systems to move quickly, and I do think there's a partnership element of connecting directly into the Epic or Cerner system or into our HME-provider systems on the electronic front. And it's a global play. It goes beyond just the first four ways, really just been in the U.S. in the Americas region, but we are now moving our Informatics capabilities into France, Germany, Japan, and it's really something that is going to go global. So I think it quickly goes from where it is now to 100% over the coming quarters and fiscal year. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Okay. And then as the follow-up, the Curative transaction that you just announced. I know that you didn't want to provide too much in the way of details, but could you just give us a sense for how quickly that business is growing and the profitability profile versus overall resonating? Michael Farrell : So we're not going to get into specific details on it because it's not material to our global business. It's on the order of 1% of our group revenues. It's growing faster than our group, and we're very excited about the opportunity. It takes us to a leadership position within the China market and sleep and respiratory medicine. And Jason Sun, the founder and CEO, is a great gentlemen, an individual, a very smart leader and entrepreneur who's created a very strong team around him in Suzhou. And we're really excited to be partnering with Curative to help grow and help the Chinese population get access to great care across the customer segments from Curative and ResMed. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Taylor : Hi. Apologies for before, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask one about masks. In the beginning of your prepared comments, you said that you were excited about mask growth next year, you expected robust growth. And I was wondering if you could just help us qualitatively understand what's driving that? If it's pull-through or launches or both, or just continued strength of the product? Michael Farrell : Yeah, Matt, I'm excited about the mask growth. People close to the business are even more excited about it. I'm going to hand it over to Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to talk about it. James Hollingshead : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. We've talked over the last two or three quarters about how we changed our pricing strategy and now that that's been grandfathered I think the biggest move that happened this quarter is a lot of those pricing moves that we made in mask in the second half of the prior year of neg ramp [ph] following through. So we've seen pricing stabilize. The AirFit range of masks continues to compete very, very strongly, I would say especially in pillows and full face. The nasal market has always been the most competitive category of masks and continues to be quite competitive. But our volumes are up and our pricing is stabilizing. We have a very strong position and we feel confident we can maintain growth. Matthew Taylor : Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on flow gens, just given how strong the Americas growth has been, once you start comping those big numbers, how much more can you grow over those 53%, 42% growth numbers that you had in the back half? Michael Farrell : Yeah, Matt, if you look at our global sleep and respiratory market, we believe it's growing in the sort of mid-single digits. So you can't grow double-digits forever, but our goal is to not just meet but we want to beat market growth in every geography we're in every financial period we're there. So we're searching for excellence. The team has produced excellence, and we're going to continue to do what we can to outperform market growth. Matthew Taylor : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ian Abbott : Oh, yes. Good afternoon. I was just wondering on the informatics where you're at in the roll-out of that to DMEs in the U.S.? Do you think you've pretty much reached all of them with your latest informatics, or do you still get some way to go there? Michael Farrell : Jim? James Hollingshead : It's a great question, Ian. Thanks. The \u2013 where we've seen everybody with the initial offering, right? So the uptake of the initial offering has been very, very strong. And I think that that's a huge contributor to the flow gen growth. We're taking share in flow gen and I think we're taking share in flow gen. And a large part of the devices is great the device, both the AirSense and AirCurve devices are fantastic devices, just an aside [ph] , but the Informatics side of that with anybody comms and the Software-as-a-Service platform is clearly starting to get uptake because it creates a lot of value for our customers. And what they're seeing is both they can increase compliance and therefore increase revenue, but they also take out a lot of labor-intensive processes with it and troubleshooting and patient management some. So broadly it's getting adopted. We will add to the platform. So you see things like the Jaysec acquisition and the CareTouch acquisition. As we build on the platform our customers will get even more growth. And so as we build the platform we hope to drive even more adoption, which should maintain an even grow share in the flow gen space, make our customers' businesses more productive, more profitable, and improve the health of the market for both us and for our customers. Ian Abbott : So would mastery [ph] be on some version of it already? I mean I know you're saying you're rolling out more, but do you feel like you're fairly well there already? James Hollingshead : I think there's a lot of growth to come. I mean I think that the platform will grow and so we'll have more feature sets and more opportunities for growth as the platform grows, but we've had very broad adoption of the product set across the whole market of HMEs, right. It's not restricted to a customer set. We're getting broad adoption across all of our customers. We're getting growing adoption across our customers. And we will continue to drive that as we add more features to the platform. Michael Farrell : And Ian, I'd add that beyond the U.S. geography which sort of has been the first early adopter here if you like of the Healthcare Informatics solutions, and that study I referenced was based in the U.S., we're seeing the same thing as we take this offering to France, to Germany, to Japan, across Northern Europe and we will be taking this globally to all of the 100 countries that we provide products in. And the value that's provided in this is universal. I mean we take waste and inefficiency out of the delivery system. We provide data real-time, we call it the HALO, Hour After Last Off. You literally can put your mask down at 6 :30 a.m., by 7 :30 a.m. your data are in the cloud and they're available for you on your smartphone on myAir. There available for the doctor at your 7 :30 appointment. And they've available to the portfolio manager who's looking at a population of chronic disease, of COPD, sleep apnea or heart failure or hypertension patients. And so the value of that has such a low runway that Jim saying it's available to every customer in the U.S. is 100% true, but has it fully unlocked all its value in the U.S.? No way. And has it gone to every country around the world that we do business in? And have we been able to show that value fully yet? No way. There's a whole lot of runway left on that. Ian Abbott : Okay. Thank you. And my other question was about SERVE-HF; it's now a couple of months since you actually came out with the trial, initial trial data. How would you characterize the response from the sleep doctors from that, and the cardiologists? How would you sort of in general characterize the response, and what sort of things are they looking for going forward? Michael Farrell : So on this one, I won't characterize a response. I'll read out the response from the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, which is the journal of the American Thoracic Society. Let's read two paragraphs out. This is four authors from University of British Colombia, Johns Hopkins, Brown and others. The title of the paragraph is What Should we do with Patients Being Treated with ASV for Other Indications? And I'll just quote this. \"It is important to note that survey chest study only included patients with heart fail, with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly central events, and the findings should not be extrapolated beyond the study population. Patients who have been given ASV for other indications, such as narcotic injuries, central sleep apnea, heart failure, preserved ejection fraction or complex sleep apnea, can likely continue ASV safely as we see no compelling reason to withdraw, especially if there is a beneficial impact on their symptoms.\" And they go on further to say, \"We believe that newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea should be treated on CPAP as a first-line treatment of obstructive sleep apnea if clinically indicated as there is no compelling reason to believe that CPAP is harmful in any way with heart fail, with reduced ejection fraction patients.\" So they're just two quotes directly from publication in mid-July from APS. What we've seen out in the market is exactly that. The sleep physicians and the cardiologists are working together to look for patient groups where they can double-down on treatment with, I would say, bi-level, oxygen and ASV, and they're looking for areas where there might a safety signal, but as we delve further and further into the SERVE-HF data, our chief medical officer said at a session at APSS that when you get ejection fraction above 30%, the safety signal goes away. So these data are going to get out there. There's going to be public, and there's going to be a lot of follow on, but the dust has sort of settled on these last two months, and it's sort of what we predicted, as I said earlier, in the numbers, and as adjusted earlier, they're from the peer-reviewed press that we're starting to see articles concerning that and certainly in the numbers we're seeing in sales and the channel. We're seeing that we're all moving forward, and a great thing about this is that we've done some great scientific research. We have the data on Kern-Loin [ph] showing a 60% reduction in mortality in severe COPD, and we had a safety signal in heart failure. But our reputation at ResMed in our clinical community only goes up by these large, randomized controlled trials that we publish in the peer-reviewed press and will continue to do that. Ian Abbott : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Low from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Low : Thanks very much. I think most of the questions have been asked, but just a couple of ones. Competitive bidding, which is a national roll-out next calendar year, what are your expectations or the implications of that? Michael Farrell : Dave? David Pendarvis : So it's still a little bit up in the air, but the announcement is that you've got a January 1 phase-in that goes sort of half and half with existing rights and half with the national averages, or national averages plus 110% depending upon whether you're in an MSA or not. And then July 1 going forward would be the new rights set on either the national or local averages. But we obviously support our customers. We think our customers ought to be getting fair value for the services that they are providing. And I know there is still dialogue that is going on. So it remains to be seen whether or not this goes forward on the date as scheduled but regardless we think that this competitive bidding that's been in round one and in round two is a known quantity. So from a disruption standpoint there should be less, there's a little bit easier to plan for. And also because there's no reduction in the number of providers while on the one hand you'd say for our customers it's not quite as fair because they're just taking the price cuts without getting the volume up. On the other hand, there's less disruption in terms of who's going to be in the market as a customer. So we'll wait and see when it comes out and how it progresses. But we feel reasonably confident about how the market is going to develop between here and there. David Low : Okay, thanks. And just switching to the acquisition that's been announced today, Curative. Am I right in understanding that effectively you'll have two product ranges in China? And is that a strategy that you'd expect to take to other markets? Michael Farrell : Sir Rob Douglas will answer this. Robert Douglas : Yeah, thanks, David. So we think the Curative brand is actually quite strong in China. It's one of the major players there. And the interesting thing behind the acquisition rational, there's a very strong correlation in culture and values in those brands values. And also as we think about China in terms of segmentation in the market where there are people who want to buy our stuff, expensive stuff and people who want good stuff, local. And so we \u2013 and our distribution channels are actually quite complementary through that. So specifically in China we see that multi-brand strategy working well and we talk with our teams, we will have coordinated strategies, but we'll be very independent entities. And we think that's a very efficient way to run an integration plan. As we look at other markets they'll be done on a market-by-market basis as to what makes sense in those as we move across the world. David Low : So is security offer cheaper presumably then a ResMed or a Respironics offer? Michael Farrell : You know what? I don't think we'd go there. It's more a question of functioning, good functioning, good value products, our target into the right segments. And really these products have all been designed in China for the China market. So they really got the right picture fit for those patients that have targeted that. David Low : Okay. Great. Well, thanks very much. Michael Farrell : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Securities. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I have a very specific one and a very big picture one. First one specific, what's really interesting to me is that year-over-year your gross margins declined by 450 basis points, but operating margins are only down 90 basis points which means you're managing the rest of your expenses. How do I think about the FX impact that rolls through the other expenses that helped you capture that only 90 basis point hit? Michael Farrell : Brett, do you want to have the first go at that and maybe Rob add some color? Brett Sandercock : Yeah. I mean Joanne, you're right, I mean we do take more of a holistic approach to it and sort of the products and for example the flow gen growth's been great on top line, been some pressure on the gross margin but we also managed the operating expenses as well. So at an operating profit level, and you can look at it on a non-GAAP basis, operating profits grew 5% notwithstanding a bunch of FX headwinds and distractions from SERVE-HF and so on. So this thing kind of demonstrates pretty resilient, pretty robust business I think. And so we try to manage it across the board, not just kind of one particular segment. So but the currency, so I mean certainly it helps us if you like the currencies through the SG&A and R&D, helps us a bit on the gross margin. I think if you step back, take a longer term, I think we're still very committed to getting operating leverage at kind of that SG&A or operating profit level, so I think, think of it in that context, that we do want to get operating leverage there. To the extent we get that, that's certainly going to drop to the bottom line and help our earnings per share. Joanne Wuensch : That's helpful. So it implies that, that is the right way to think about this holistically, that there's a lot of pieces running through this and that there's room over time... Brett Sandercock : Exactly. Joanne Wuensch : Okay. Brett Sandercock : Exactly. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Now for the big picture question, most of my medtech companies at this stage are consolidating. We're running a lot of merger models on a regular basis. You guys have done an amazing job since the spin-out from Baxter, you're making tuck-in acquisitions like we saw today in China. How do you think about playing the new world order where more product is better product? Michael Farrell : Well, Joanne, you know we play in a different space to companies like the big ones you're talking about like Medtronic, Covidien, Label [ph] . You're selling products to hospitals and large GPOs [ph] . Our job, and at some of the lines with the Western European healthcare systems and where the U.S. healthcare system has now gone with Accountable Care organizations, that the goal now is to keep patients out of hospital and in the home. And within the homecare medical device space we have a very strong position, and certainly within the respiratory medical and COPD side we're the market leader in driving those channels. So I would say our opportunity is to continue to drive value to show that taking patients out of hospital and putting them into the home is the right thing. And our job is to run faster and do better and to make sure that we continue to grow. We will continue to look at M&A, as we announced on this call two acquisitions, and our goal is organic growth and leveraging our current business, driving the operating leverage that you mentioned in the first part of your question, but also looking strategically at how we can add value to the marketplace, and I think taking patients out of the hospital, managing them in the home, getting the data to the cloud so you can quantify the benefit of that is kind of a unique value proposition, if you like, to the medical device market. Yeah, we have competition, and we continue to compete against our fellow competitors in the homecare space and the respiratory space. I think we do it better and I think we'll continue to lead and innovate and look at appropriate M&A to keep ourselves at the front of the pack. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Joanne. Operator : And we are now at the one hour mark. I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for closing remarks. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Kelly. In closing, I want to thank the more than 4,000 ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing millions of lives with every breath. We've had an incredible year launching game-changing products and services and we've reached $1.7 billion in annual revenues, but we remain laser focused on our long-term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time today. Agnes Lee : Thank you again for joining us. If there's any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investors.resmed.com. Kelly, you may now close the call. Operator : This concludes ResMed's third quarter earnings live webcast.

I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our fiscal Q1 2016 quarterly results. We have started the year with very strong sales growth in both our sleep apnea business and our respiratory care business. In my remarks, I'll discuss our top and bottom line results, some regional highlights from our global business, as well as an overview of the progress that we have made against our ResMed 2020 strategy. After that, as usual, I will hand over to Brett to walk you through the financial results in greater detail. Once again, this quarter, our global team achieved double-digit top line revenue growth on a constant currency of 15%. We saw strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth, and we achieved solid steady growth our combined EMEA and APAC group. These global results were fueled by the success of our new product and solutions launches in both our sleep apnea and our respiratory care businesses. Looking at the bottom line, our diluted EPS was $0.58 on a non-GAAP basis. EPS was $0.57 on a GAAP basis. We have been balancing our investment growth opportunities whilst carefully managing our growth in R&D and SG&A. We gained operating leverage this quarter, as both R&D as well as SG&A grew at a lower rate than our top line revenue. We are on track to further increase operating leverage throughout fiscal year 2016 and we are executing on our plans to improve gross margin, driving further efficiency improvements in both manufacturing and supply chain costs, as I outlined last quarter. We have a lot of runway left for ongoing growth of our high margin product businesses, including the AirCurve 10 bilevel platform and our Astral life support ventilation platform. As we look forward over the coming fiscal quarters and the fiscal year, we will further leverage our automated informatics solutions to drive ongoing mask and accessories resupply growth. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region, we had a very strong sales performance in Q1, with our team driving north of 20% growth on a year-on-year basis. Flow generator growth was 39%, reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, and our Astral platforms, as well as our end-to-end Healthcare Informatics solutions. Mask and accessories grew at 9% during the quarter in the Americas. Pricing continues to be stable in the mask categories. We continue to expect positive mask and accessories growth throughout fiscal year 2016. Moving on to our combined EMEA and APAC group, we grew at 5% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators and our mask and accessory businesses in the EMEA and APAC group. Clearly, the SERVE-HF results and our contraindication for ASV in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnea patients was a headwind. ASV sales in Europe were more affected than we had predicted. However, it is important to note that ASV sales in APAC and the U.S. were significantly less affected than in Europe. We have not seen any impact beyond our ASV sales for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in predominant central sleep apnea. This is consistent with the conclusions from the New England Journal of Medicine publication and the commentary from key opinion leaders in The Lancet, in CHEST, and in the Blue journal, all stating that the data from the study should not be extrapolated beyond the treatment group. It just makes good sense. APAC sales were strong in the quarter and we continue to see robust growth across all of our high growth markets this quarter, including China. We announced earlier this month that we have now completed the acquisition of Curative Medical. This partnership of our ResMed China business and the Curative Medical team provides us with a leading market share position in China and a separate brand with innovative products that are developed and manufactured in China for China. This acquisition will allow us to expand both the sleep apnea and respiratory care markets in China and beyond. Now I'd like to talk more about our progress against our ResMed 2020 Three Horizons Growth Strategy. Earlier this month, ResMed was a platinum sponsor for the annual meeting of AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, and the meeting was held right here in San Diego. AdvaMed is the world's largest med tech association and its conference is the most important in the med tech industry globally. One of the main themes of AdvaMed 2015 was the increasing importance of digital health for medical devices and connected care for patients. ResMed has been at the very forefront of healthcare informatics innovation for over a decade. We are leading and driving this trend for our industry. Just over one year after the launch of the Air Solutions Platform and the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10, we have well over 1 million patients with cloud-connected medical devices sitting on their bedside tables. As these devices provide daily updates to the cloud, it allows ResMed to provide actionable information for patients, physicians, providers and for payers. We have built an industry-leading core competency in healthcare informatics allowing us to provide the best value with market-leading solutions that improve operational efficiency, improve patient adherence and improve long-term outcomes for patients. Our customers clearly understand the value proposition of ResMed's Air Solutions. Most of the time, we cannot talk publicly about these results, but one of our customers has allowed us to report on their increased staff efficiency and accelerated business growth after adopting Air Solutions from ResMed. Based on their own data, this customer is saving 80 labor hours per month, reducing the number of unreached patients by more than 85% and increasing the number of new patient setups by 55% on a year-over-year basis. These results are a big part of why so many customers are partnering with ResMed. We have many other examples of customer success using our healthcare informatics solutions. U-Sleep is the ResMed-branded cloud-based application that monitors patient adherence and automatically identifies and triages which patients need the most help so that a homecare provider can proactively address issues and provide better care. In a previous investor call, I talked about a study presented at the American Thoracic Society in which a U-Sleep customer saw patient adherence increase from 73% to 83% along with a 59% decrease in their labor costs. To prove that this was not a one-time, one-customer event, let me provide an overview of a study just published in the Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research. This study showed that by using adherence coaching from U-Sleep, the customer was able to increase compliance from 60% using standard adherence monitoring up to 87% using the automated compliance monitoring capabilities of our U-Sleep solution. In addition to this 27% increase in the number of adherent patients on therapy, the customer staff was able to set up 83% more patients at the same labor cost. This is clearly a very significant operating efficiency improvement for our customer. The acquisitions of Jaysec and CareTouch have added new capabilities to our end-to-end solution that we call ResMed ReSupply. This capability provides automated resupply solutions for our customers so that they can efficiently manage mask and accessory resupply to patients through automated text, email or interactive voice response, with a multilingual call center backing up the solution live, if necessary. We have seen great success with the Air Solutions platform and devices, and we will continue to build our healthcare informatics capabilities so that we can drive channel efficiencies, unlock cost savings, drive appropriate growth in masks and accessories provision to patients, and, ultimately, improve long-term patient outcomes. In the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we see opportunities to leverage the healthcare informatics strength from our sleep apnea business directly into our adjacent respiratory care businesses. We are already taking AirCurve 10 data to the cloud, and you will hear more from us on this front as we move forward. Watch this space. We are expanding our presence in the U.S. respiratory care market and building on our strong presence in Europe for both our life support ventilation solutions, and our non-invasive ventilation solutions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular disease. Another growth vector under our second horizon of growth is our ongoing investments in high growth market geographies. With the completion of the Curative Medical acquisition, we are now the market share leader in the sleep apnea and respiratory care market in China. We are extremely well-positioned for sustained long-term growth, with two strategically aligned, yet operationally independent teams targeting different, yet fast-growing customer segments within the China market. We continue to invest in high growth markets like China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. In each geography, we provide and drive long-term strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall system healthcare costs within each individual country, proving on that promise with hard data. Finally, let's review our third horizon of growth. Let me first spend a few moments talking about SERVE-HF. As you all know, ResMed put patient safety first and foremost. It was the most important priority when we announced the preliminary study results from SERVE back in May, many months before the study was eventually published. As we had expected, the SERVE-HF study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine quite recently. The study's primary investigators presented results at the European Society of Cardiology and at the European Respiratory Society conferences. The results of the study, the safety signal, and the contraindication remain unchanged from May. It is worth noting that our ASV business in other market segments has been unaffected in these last five months since the SERVE-HF announcement. These other segments include treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, time-management-induced central sleep apnea, and post-traumatic stress disorder-related uses of ASV. These all remain strong market segments in the U.S., and we are working on expanding these applications further through Europe and Asia Pacific. Our third horizon of growth includes a number of cardio-respiratory treatment opportunities, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and chronic disease management opportunities in cardiology. These are very exciting longer-term opportunities that we will speak more about later. Returning to our quarterly results, we remain active on the capital management front. In this quarter, we bought back 1.2 million shares in addition to funding our dividend. Through September 30, our stock repurchase program has returned to shareholders a total of $1.5 billion. It's your cash and we think you should get it back. We continue to look for potential acquisitions where three key criteria are met; one, the business is aligned with our long-term strategy; two, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed's shareholder value; and three, that there is a cultural fit between the acquisition target business and ResMed's team. We hit all of these three criteria solidly with the Curative Medical acquisition, and we will continue to refresh our acquisition radar screen with further growth opportunities as we look forward. At ResMed, we are the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but, more importantly, in products and informatics solutions innovation, as well as in service, channel, and market innovation. We remain very excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, for our partners, and, most importantly, for many, many millions of patients around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brett, for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials. Brett? Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer : Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the September quarter was $411.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, where in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $26.8 million in the first quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $254.1 million, an increase of 23% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and APAC group totaled $157.5 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and APAC group increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas' flow generator sales were $132.1 million, an increase of 39% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in the combined EMEA and APAC group, flow generator sales were $107.5 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 5%. Masks and other sales were $50 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior-year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 20% while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 58%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 440 basis points, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, declines in average selling prices, an unfavorable geographic mix, and adverse currency movements. Looking forward, in fiscal year 2016, we still expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. If gross margin drivers like currency fluctuation and geographic and product mix move beyond their expectations, they could swing this range further. As we discussed last quarter, we expect to progressively see the benefits from our cost out programs, including procurement, production, and logistics improvements, reflected in our fiscal year 2016 gross margin. In particular, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we expect to see a benefit from a normalized sea/air freight mix and from the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $111.1 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11%, primarily due to higher employee compensation and the impact of recent acquisitions. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27% compared to the year-ago figure of 29.1%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.2 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter, but on a constant currency basis, an increase of 12%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, including informatics solutions, but also the benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.3 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, compared to 18.3% in the prior-year quarter. You may recall in the prior-year tax rate, this was favorably impacted by a net tax benefit of $3.2 million, arising from the conclusion of a long-running German tax audit. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2016 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Operating profit for the quarter was $98 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. However, net income for the quarter declined by 3% to $80.4 million as a result of foreign currency hedging losses and lower interest income. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year quarter. Overall, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro, largely offset by the weaker Australian dollar. On a constant currency basis, diluted earnings per share were consistent with the prior-year quarter. Cash flow from operations was $122.1 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16.4 million, while depreciation/amortization for the September quarter totaled $18.4 million. We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. Additionally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for the consideration of $62 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 14.3 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. In October, we announced the closing of the Curative acquisition. We have not disclosed the financial terms of the transaction. The acquisition has been funded by utilizing our existing cash balances, and the entity will be included in our consolidated results in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. For the rolling 12 months ended September 30, we have returned 92% of free cash flow to shareholders for our dividends and repurchases. And over the last five years, we have returned 99% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $321 million. And at September 30, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A, and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Melissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could perhaps talk through the guidance a little bit. There's been some changes. So I think at the full year result you talked about an SG&A range of 27% to 28%. That's come down by 100 basis points. And the tax rate guidance has also come down by 100 basis points as well. I'm just wondering what's changed in the last three months to see those things come down. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Brett, do you want to have a go at that? Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I'll take that, Mick. Thanks. Yeah, Ian, that's right, we have guided that down a little in SG&A. As Mick mentioned, we've been focused on the operating leverage throughout the group and we do think we can achieve that through fiscal year 2016. So with some of the plans we have, we do believe that we can bring that down a little and provide some operating leverage there. So on the SG&A front, we feel confident we should bring that guidance down where we see some improvements we're planning throughout the year. On the effective tax rate, it moves around a bit with geographic mix. If you look at last year's sort of full-year underlying tax rate, it was sort of around that 19.5% level. So it's kind of in that range. So we just brought that down a tad just based on where we see the forecast going out. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.: Okay. And then in a similar vein, you mentioned the gross margin. You kept that guidance the same, but you did sort of flag that various movements could see you go out of the range. It is a very wide range and this result was pretty much in the middle of the range. I'm just wondering what sort of things could drive it materially outside that range. Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer : We did widen that a little bit, Ian, really because there's, if you look at it over the last year or so, quite a bit of volatility on exchange rates. For example, you're seeing the Aussie come down something like 7%, 8%, which is quite significant. Now I'm not suggesting that that's going to happen again this year, but, as you know, anything is possible. And we're also seeing some pretty significant movements or some big outperformance on flow generators, particularly in the U.S. So I suppose as a caveat, there's always quite a bit of volatility around the gross margin. It's probably the hardest number to predict. So we widened that out a little bit. I think as we get through the course of the fiscal year, we can probably get some more confidence on sort of the band or how wide that is. But at this stage early in the fiscal, we've left it as is. But I have said there that certainly on the things such as freight, where we are normalizing that now, certainly doing a lot less air freight as we have the inventories at levels that we think are appropriate. That's certainly going to help us into Q2. And, as you know, the Aussie dollar has depreciated more recently. There's about a quarter's lag on that, so we don't really see that benefit until Q2. But that benefit will be meaningful as well going into Q2. I guess some of the headwinds we're facing are kind of abating a little bit, and so we should be able to see some improvements throughout fiscal year 2016. Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open. Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us any qualitative commentary on what helped the mask growth this quarter. I mean, you had, I guess, a little bit of easier comp, but certainly saw some acceleration there. If you could talk about any products or trends or pull-through, things that might help us to understand how the mask growth could progress. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks for the question, Matt. Yeah, that allows us to talk about the mask business in total. I mean, what we've seen over the last three quarters is clearly some good growth turnaround and success in masks. It's not driven by brand new products; it's more driven by us focusing on partnering with our customers around understanding resupply. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we've invested a lot these last 12 months in getting well over 1 million bedside tables with 100% cloud-connected devices that now enable us to have information on patients. And we're able to take those data to the cloud and contact patients and encourage them and drive patient adherence and work with our HME providers in the U.S. and with our other partners in other countries around the world to give patients appropriate access to masks and accessories as they need them over the time of their therapy. And I think you're just seeing the very start of the roadmap of us working on those informatics systems and leveraging them to drive mask and accessories resupply, but I think that's been a factor in the equation. As you said, the comp was not incredibly difficult. And so having 9% growth in the Americas over the comp is somewhat a result of that comp. But I think it's more due to the fact that we're focused on resupply, we're partnering with our customers on it and we're really establishing tools and capabilities that are automated, scalable and replicable. And so that gives us a long runway throughout the fiscal year to be able to drive resupply in masks and accessories. Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And just to follow up on that, could you give us any metrics that you're tracking or some kind of a guidepost on resupply to help us understand the improvements you've made and maybe where you could go? I don't know if it's masks per year or how you think about it? And then you mentioned price was stable in masks. Any changes outside the U.S.? I think your comment was on the Americas. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim Hollingshead, who's probably closer to the business and any metrics we're looking at from the resupply, but we may or may not want to release that. James Hollingshead - President-Americas: I don't think we'd want to talk about metrics that we put on the resupply business. I think what I'd add to Mick's comments about the Americas market, in particular on masks, is that we've been talking for several months about the pricing strategy we made a while ago. And those pricing changes have now annualized, so one of the things that allowed us to show a better revenue growth number this quarter was the pricing has really stabilized for us. We're the mask market leader both in the Americas and globally. In particular, our Air Fit range is very well positioned. And so we continue to enjoy good volume growth just in the mask business with patients getting \u2013 new patients getting masks. And then, with the efforts we made in automating resupply and driving resupply, we've enjoyed the growth on the back end of that, but I don't think we want to get into sort of ratios and metrics on that at this point. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And maybe the second part of the question, which focused beyond the U.S., the global aspects, Rob Douglas, our COO, any thoughts on that? Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Matt. Globally, the masks are performing well. The AirFit range is a very strong mask range, and we are very competitive with those masks. Our teams work hard with our customers and they've got strong relationships around the world. And we're confident those masks are going to keep performing strongly. Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if we could get a bit of a guide on device growth ex-ASV, if possible. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sean, I don't think we're going to release a new metric on this earnings call. I mean, the bottom line is, as we said in May, less than 7% of our global business is in the ASV side of the business, and it's obviously reduced from that over these last sort of 150 days. The growth that we saw \u2013 pretty phenomenal growth of 39% in the Americas, flow generators, and on a constant currency basis, 5% growth of flow generators in EMEA and APAC combined \u2013 was driven really by the new launch of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 and the Astral. And so those have been driving the growth. Europe clearly had a bit of a headwind due to the contraindication for heart failure patients with a reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnea, where we issued that contraindication. But as I also said in the prepared remarks, we really have not seen any impact on ASV beyond that in the other market segments, if you like, that we sell the product in. So it's been pretty steady in that. But, Sean, yeah, I don't want to start breaking out ASV and non-ASV mask growth for competitive reasons, and also just for the fact of \u2013 we've got quite a lot of runway left on those product launches, and I want to just look at the macro numbers as they come out. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.: Sure, Mick. Thanks. Can I just squeeze one more in? Just to clarify, with respect to mask pricing in the U.S., is that fully lapped yet, or is it a next quarter event when it's fully lapped, the reduction in mask pricing? Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Sean, yeah, you're referring to, I think, the January through June 2014 price changes, which have now lapped because we passed \u2013 we lapped the June 2015 timeframe. So we are now fully lapped on those ASP reductions and we're back to sort of steady, as we said, pretty steady mask pricing. And we're seeing often our competitors out there competing on value of what the masks can achieve in terms of patient fit, quiet, comfort, first time fit and patient acceptance. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.: Great, Mick. Thanks. That's all I had. Appreciate your time. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Sean. Operator : Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj, your line is open. Your next question comes from Will Dunlop with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you can please talk to the different market growth you're seeing in the U.S. between flow gens and masks. Do you think the market for both categories is growing at a slightly decent rate? And if so, what are some of the trends that are driving that/ Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'll start at a high level and then hand over to Jim maybe for some detail. Globally, we see the sleep apnea market in general growing in the mid-single digits. As you saw from these numbers, we don't accept market growth. We drive ResMed growth and we want to meet or beat those market growth numbers. And so we were able to beat across our businesses, able to beat both mid-single-digit numbers in flow generators and in masks. The commentary I'd make before handing to Jim is that the high flow generator numbers we saw particularly in the Americas were driven by new product launches, and a lot of that was share gain based upon the value prop of the Informatics systems, the air solutions that I talked about in the prepared remarks. So, less to do with the differential between flow gens and masks, they are more to do with the value prop of air solutions. But, Jim, any more color from the rest of the market, the Americas market? James Hollingshead - President-Americas: Yeah, I think that's spot on. I think the difference you see in the numbers is we've, on a longstanding basis, been the mask market leader. But with the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10, we've taken significant market share over the last several months since the launch of both of those product lines. And that's due both to the fact that those product platforms, just as products, as flow generators, are outstanding products. But really it's about, as Mick has just said and said in his opening comments, it's about the all-in solutions offer, the Air Solutions platform is driving significant revenue growth in business efficiencies for our customers, and they're recognizing that. And as they continue to recognize that and adopt the overall Air Solutions platform, they're of necessity buying more of our flow generators to enjoy those benefits. So really there's not a separate growth number behind those two product categories. The underlying market growth is the same, we're just taking more share in flow gen. William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And are you seeing any change in the way private insurers are funding or reimbursing CPAP in terms of moving from a fee-for-product model to perhaps a capitation or a per-patient model? Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, the U.S. market particularly is evolving from a fee-for-service market to really a value-driven or a fee-for-value driven market as a whole. And you're seeing more models like the Kaiser Permanente model, the Intermountain Healthcare model, the Geisinger model start to come into play. And the government is trying to replicate those really solid private company payer provider models with its accountable-care organization or ACO models and its IDN models. And we are very good partners with Kaiser, with Intermountain Health, and with Geisinger. But also with the governments of the United Kingdom, the governments of Sweden, the governments of Norway, the governments of Finland, where a payer provider model has been in place for many decades. Since World War II, almost all of Western Europe adopted socialized medicine systems, public health care. And we've been working for the last 25 years with systems of fee-for-value or providing value models. And so we're very used to that type of environment. So the U.S. is undergoing an evolution. Are we a part of that evolution? And I think the informatics capability that we have, the ability to take data to the cloud and share it with patients to drive adherence is amazing, to take costs out of the system for the providers is very valuable. But the data to do population health management for a payer or a payer-provider is an opportunity through our data exchanges that we are really just starting to extrapolate. So I think your question is probably a little bit ahead of the curve as to where the value is, but we are working with systems in this new payer-provider, fee-for-value model. And we're actually really excited about that transition because our market shares are incredibly strong across Western Europe and we think we can do that in all the payer-provider models that are out there. William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Unknown Speaker : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Victor Windeyer with Citi. Your line is open. Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Hi, guys. Thanks. Well, I just wanted to ask a few things related to the ASV product. So you drew out that the pullback in Europe has been a little bit larger, a little harder than you had expected, and that Asia and Americas were in line with your expectations. I just wonder with Asia given the high use of ASV in the high (39:12) population, first, you had with the positive reimbursement in that location. Do you expect further pullback in Japan as awareness of SERVE-HF results close out through there? And then is the Curative Medical acquisition and revenue and associated gross profit enough to offset that should that occur? And then in terms of the preserved ejection fraction population that you mentioned, what's happening with the CAT-HF study given the mixed population of that enrolled patient population there? Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Victor. Well, that was a great way to get three questions in one, so I'll try to address all of that, Vic. Yeah. The first part of your question was about the ASV impact being more in Europe and less in Americas and Asia. And I think part of the genesis of your question or the core of the question, kernel of the question was, is it just that the communication is taking time to get from Europe to Asia or Europe to the Americas, and the answer to that is an emphatic no. We have, in all the 100 countries we do business in, been incredibly proactive in working with the physician groups, directly writing letters to physician groups and to physicians, working with our providers to contact all physicians and let everybody know about the field safety notice, and that was in the month of May, so north of five months ago now. And so that information has been available not only at all the international societies, but in national societies, in all the countries we do business in, and particularly the major ones. So, really, it's not a result of \u2013 the fact that there's been less impact in Asia and Americas is not a result that the communication hasn't gone out there. It's a result of the fact that there was, frankly, less heart failure referrals into our ASV business in those countries. Particularly if you look at the U.S., it was primarily at our business year in the U.S. that was driven by complex sleep apnea or treatment-emergent central sleep apnea driven by opioid-induced central sleep apnea and driven by PTSD, where ASV was used in those applications. And so, there was just less of the business that was coming from cardiology referrals, and so that just wasn't impacted. Within Japan \u2013 you mentioned Japan specifically \u2013 the use of ASV in Japan is focused on an acute basis in the hospital. And these data were based on longitudinal data in the home with no data at all about acute effect, and there have been some studies with mutual outcomes on safety but some positive outcomes on some heart failure indicator results, such as ejection fraction and others. And so, the use in Japan has sort of continued on an acute basis because it's a different application. And I don't think that will be affected by SERVE-HF and their ongoing work with Japanese researchers in the field to keep proving their safety but also the efficacy of the product in that area. The next part of your question was Curative. Is Curative going to materially offset some of this ASV decline that we're seeing in different parts of the world. I'll hand to Rob. Rob is leading the charge on the Curative integration. Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. So, Vic, the Curative acquisition was part of our Three Horizons Strategy, specifically in the second horizon. Talking about positioning ourselves to grow in these markets that look like they're going to be very high growth markets, we only completed the acquisition at the beginning of October, so we're about three weeks into it at the moment. I could say it's going very well at the moment. We're just at the CMEF, China Medical Equipment, today. It's a huge medical equipment fair in China. And we had \u2013 showing off our strategy as strategically aligned but operationally independent, we had ResMed and Curative side by side in booths but strongly showing their respective brands, and we're seeing reaction in that market to the two brands that's appropriate for what we look like. So at this stage, we're very confident that that program is going to go well. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the third part of your question, Vic, was to do with HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and our CAT-HF study. The CAT-HF study is really a pilot study now. We've closed off enrollment and we're going to follow through on all the patients and collect the data from that and likely publish those data as a pilot trial for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction work that we may do in the future. I think between atrial fibrillation, to some extent coronary artery disease in a number of markets, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may remain exciting, cardio-respiratory conditions that we are looking at. Given what happened in there, we're unlikely to do a five-year $50 million study in each of these three areas. What we're likely to do is partner with payer providers like those I mentioned earlier or governments or small payer-provider groups to run pilot trials to show improved outcomes and improved reduction in hospitalizations on a commercialized basis. So you run pilots that you get commercially paid for that can produce clinical data that may or may not get published but allows you to expand the model. And that's sort of where we're thinking for those three areas. So that includes HFpEF, AF and CAD. Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thanks very much for that. I just as my follow-up, I'll just ask, is there any evidence that the result from an acute hospitalized heart failure population will be different from the population that's been studied in SERVE? Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, there is, Vic, some indication of that. There was a study published called SAVIOR that was run out of Japan that showed a neutral safety signal but some positive data on the clinical aspects, such as ejection fraction, fluid in the lungs and length of stay in hospital. And so there's some clinical publications in that area on acute HF. You'll likely see more coming out from the Japanese researchers on that front over time. Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much. Just on masks, you talked of steady state. We're now at steady state in the U.S. Does that mean we can think of high-single digit mask growth as we look forward? Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Vic, you're jumping to five questions here now, but I'll answer it and then we'll move on. The masks growth that we saw in the U.S. of 9% this quarter was clearly very solid. Look, the market is growing in the sort of mid-single digits range. We look to meet or beat that. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're planning for positive mask and accessories growth throughout the year and we're excited and looking forward to that. Thanks a lot for your questions, Vic. Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Bye. Operator : As a reminder, please limit your question to one and one follow-up. Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. So first maybe, Mick, if you can talk about what gives you guys confidence that you can really grow generators now in the face of a potential competitive launch from Respironics. If you guys have seen anything in the field and maybe some of those guys coming back to Air Solutions that have trialed that or if (47:04) is active in that HCIT-based device yet. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Margaret. Yeah, clearly, we have seen launch from one of our competitors. The other one you mentioned hasn't launched an HCIT product yet or a cloud-connected sleep apnea product yet and we don't expect in the short term. I'm going to start out by saying it's a huge compliment I think to our innovation and our leadership in the field that our competitors are talking about and starting to follow us into cloud-connected sleep apnea devices. We think it's (47:44-48:07) right way to go, we think that the value we extracted, like I talked about, we can improve outcomes and lower costs for the channel and take out waste and inefficiency and get patients more on therapy and follow up with them more to provide appropriate mask and accessories. So I just think as an industry, it's a really good thing that we're all moving to compete on value and drive healthcare informatics-driven sleep apnea solutions. Look, clearly maintaining a 39% Americas growth in flow generators in a market where, as I said, it's growing at mid-single digits, it's unrealistic to stay at those types of levels and I don't think you or any of the other sell-side analysts, Margaret, have numbers at that exact 39% sort of rate. But clearly our goal is to not only lock in the share that we already got, but to continue to meet or beat market growth rates, which means by taking share. So that really comes down to is our value proposition better than the competition. And from what we've seen of the first competitor to launch their cloud-connected devices is that, frankly, they're not 100% cloud connected. It's got three SKUs of widgets that you need to plug in with three different connectivity modules, which is SKUs for the HMEs to manage. It's not 100% cloud-connected out of the gate in that the DME or the HME or the patient has to take some action to provide the connectivity to the cloud. So we think while it's following us in the strategic direction, some of the tactical implementations are not as good as ours. And, really importantly, even when you are connected, it comes down to then competition of whose cloud is better. And I think our healthcare informatics capability on Air Solutions is clearly the leader now. And we intend to maintain that leadership by regular updates, regular value that we provide to both patients, to providers, to physicians and to payers. So we're really excited about the new basis of competition of the industry. It's changed from being just smaller, quieter, more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected and then better connected. So we look forward to that, Margaret. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And then for my follow-up, Brett, you talked about maybe seeing more of a shift to a normalization for air/sea freight next quarter. So how far along were you guys this past quarter? Did you see any benefit from those cost-outs? Thanks. Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Margaret, the programs are in place in a number of initiatives that the team is working on for sure and have got back to that in earnest. We're sort of over that hump of making sure we matched our supply with demand, so we're through all that and we're working through. Typically, what we do with the new platforms is then drive a pretty solid cost-out program on that new platform. So we're now in the throes of doing that. You probably \u2013 maybe a little bit but really, I think more of that will flow through over the course of 2016. And it will be, as I said earlier, it will be more progressive throughout the year, I think. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Wheen with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Yes. Good morning. Just a question on gross margin again. Brett, in the past because of that one quarter lag, you've kind of indicated as to what sort of basis-point improvement we might see from FX in the next quarter. Is that something you could comment on today? Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I mean, the sequential impact there if \u2013 and I'm going to caveat this because the exchange rate is moving around all the time \u2013 but if you looked at it on the current exchange rate, it's \u2013 probably the sequential benefit of the weaker Aussie \u2013 it's in the order of 50 basis points, give or take. It's that sort of quantum. Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. And then as part of your gross margin commentary. You indicated that mix shift obviously was going against you but also ASP declined. Could you just provide some more color as to where those declines were being felt and what the drivers were? Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean, it's not \u2013 we're not giving a lot of granularity around ASP, obviously, from a competitive perspective and so on. But as Mick and Jim mentioned earlier, we've kind of let through \u2013 some of those more kind of acute adjustments we were facing on pricing, we're through that now, so it's very much more of a kind of a typical or historical type marketplace in terms of pricing. So there's still, year-on-year, still an element of declines in selling prices and so on, but they're certainly, in today's environment, much less acute than what we were facing back 12 months ago, for example. So let me say it's kind of a more of a kind of historical normal state of play. Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. That's great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much, guys. I was just going to talk to the SG&A. Obviously, up 11% constant currency, and you mentioned some investment in, I guess, emerging markets. Just trying to get a sense of that investment, whether there's much or so in your established markets like EU, and I guess the sort of payback period you're looking for with that investment, I guess, to grow those markets. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Good question, Andrew. I'll hand it to Rob Douglas. Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. So, obviously, Andrew, you know we've made some acquisitions in Australia last year, which were a bit of a change in our market model, and that's going very well for us. And then obviously the Curative that we talked about. But sort of on a case-by-case basis, our strategy is we will continue to invest locally for the local market development as appropriate, and we've got very strong teams around there. And then we're sort of challenging that with trying to get efficiency with common core processes that let us leverage really the key product range through there. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Terrific. And I guess just a quick follow-up. I know it's been a bit of mention around your competitor's entry to the market. I guess we're expecting that to take place at Medtrade this coming week. Just trying to understand if you've got particular strategies or variations that you bring to the market, I guess, just as a response or to coincide with those events. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good question, Andrew. Clearly, this is a public conference call. So if we have strategies, tactics, and plans to compete with a very clearly known 12-month anticipated product launch, it's not something we'd go through on the earnings call here. But look, the bottom line is, of course, we're ready for competition in this space. As I sort of talked to on the response to Margaret earlier, we're quite complimented and excited about the fact that the new base of the competition is healthcare informatics and how good your cloud is. And we're really excited about how strong Air Solutions is, and the value that we provide. How well we have done, frankly, the last 12 months of getting north of a million devices out there, connected to the cloud and providing value to those customers. And we know that they've seen the value. Of course they're going to try and sample a new product out there. And we do think that the share we've gained will be something that we build upon because of the value that we're providing. But it's a competitive game and we look forward to it and we're ready for it. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: I know it's adding to the question, probably wasn't phrased particularly well. But I guess the feedback we're getting with the cloud is quite a sticky proposition in a way it wasn't in the past. The flow generator, I guess, just sort of seeing how much you think that gives you a bit of a stronger defense than what you might have had in the past. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, I think the value is incredible. I mean, I talked about in the last call, 59% labor cost savings. I talked about on this call, 83% more patient setup with the same labor cost. I mean, these numbers are incredible and these are just the ones that customers have said that it's okay for us to talk about because they're in markets where they sort of have stronger control and they're comfortable sharing those data. The ones in competitive markets are getting similar results and don't want to share the data. Jim, I mean, you're closer to the business on this. Do you want to share any further anecdotes? James Hollingshead - President-Americas: Yeah, I think it's a really good question, Andrew. We feel very confident that we have a superior offer. We're getting what you might term a lot of customer loyalty off of the offer because of the value that it's driving. The device is a better device. It's simpler to use. It's simpler to set up. It has a very elegant and reliable cloud connection built into it, so it's not complex to get a connection to the cloud; and then our software offerings are the only offerings on the market that are proven to increase compliance and therefore increase revenue and to lower costs. And so we feel very confident. As Mick said, it's actually good for the market for the basis of competition in sleep apnea to shift towards health informatics because it provides end-to-end care for patients. It will provide better bang for the buck for the entire healthcare system. And it puts us in a very good position because we've enjoyed more than a year long lead in that now, and we'll continue to press that lead, so we feel very confident. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Terrific. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open. David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my questions and good afternoon. You said, Mick, in your prepared remarks that you had the highest market share globally. I'd be very interested to know what you think your market share is and how you derive that number. That's my first question. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, David. Absolutely willing and happy to say that we are the market share leader. I don't want to go \u2013 we're in 100 countries, and I don't want to go into individual countries or individual market shares within any of those individual countries. But as you've seen these really, really strong high double-digit growth numbers over these last four quarters in flow generators and look at the number of devices that we've sold and the market share and your assessment of the market. I think you'd be pretty confident, and pretty much every sell-side analyst out there would be pretty confident that we're the market share leader in not only flow generators, but also in masks globally. But we don't sort of want to go into the details of it, David, for competitive reasons. Look, the main thing about market leadership is not just the market share leadership but the fact that you're innovating better and driving value. And I think one of the core parts of this is providing value for the end users in this whole system, who are the patients. We provide the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, and most connected care altogether to patients, and I think that's what's really driving our growth and leadership. And frankly, it's a challenge for us and anyone else playing in the field to continue to do that. And that's what the game is going to be going forward, providing that long term value to patients. David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thank you. And I wonder if you could give us an update, basically following on from previous questions, can you give us an idea of the replenishment, the mask replenishment environment in the U.S. in terms of payers? Are payers more or less willing to see mask replenishment than perhaps they were even a year or two years ago? Thanks very much. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks, David. Replenishment is a really important part of sleep apnea care because the masks do degrade over time and become more leaky. And to have a patient on sleep apnea care \u2013 for a payer who is following it properly, a payer provider who is following it properly, the investment of $100-odd on a mask every six months to keep a patient out of hospital where a visit to a hospital can cost $2,000 to $3,000 to $5,000 just walking in the door and spending one day there. The return on investment for our payer providers who are really following this model closely amongst their sleep apnea patients, their COPD patients, their neuromuscular disease patients, their (1:01:08) patients, the ROI is a no-brainer when you've got the data. I think our informatics solutions are allowing us to have the data to provide the payer-providers and show that ROI. And so, I think you are transitioning from sort of a world of utilization management, where people just think of unit costs in a fee-for-service world, to a world of care management where people are thinking about holistic costs to the patient and what it costs to not provide the diabetes supplies or to not provide the hypertensive meds or to not provide the sleep apnea mask. And it's saying, I'm going to cut back on diabetes supplies to save myself money when then the diabetic is back in the hospital or to cut back on the number of masks and, therefore, have the sleep apnea patients show up at the hospital is sort of a 1980s way of looking at things in the utilization management front. So I think we are seeing that transition and I think that the payers are really moving to that world of ACOs and payer-providers and looking to mimic the model of those successful payer-providers. But it's a transition world and we are playing in both the fee-for-service world and in the care management world and balancing between the two very carefully. Operator : We are now at the one-hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks a lot, Melissa. And thanks for all the good questions. In closing, I want to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath. I'm very proud of what this team has accomplished in creating the market-leading innovation in connected care and healthcare informatics solutions in our medical devices. And we remain focused on our long-term goal of changing 20 million patient lives by 2020. Thanks a lot and we'll talk to you all in 90 days.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Susan, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Susan, and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects of the Company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us on today, as we summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. We have made great progress towards our long-term ResMed 2020 goals this quarter. We achieved solid double-digit constant currency revenue growth led by strong regional results in the Americas. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Inova Labs based in Austin, Texas. This acquisition expands our respiratory care therapeutics portfolio for COPD each now include portable oxygen concentrators. First, I\u2019ll discuss our top and bottom-line results, I\u2019ll then review some regional highlights from our business and progress on our ResMed 2020 strategy. After that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett our CFO to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. For the fifth quarter in a row, our global team achieved double-digit top line revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We saw strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth at 17%. We achieved solid steady growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regional groups. These global results were fueled by the ongoing success of Air Solutions, our cloud-based connected care software platform, as well as the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 medical device platforms. Looking at the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share was $0.69 on a non-GAAP basis. We have been balancing our investments and growth opportunities, and significantly expanding our install base of cloud connected medical devices. At the same time, we have been efficiently managing our OpEx growth in both R&D as well as SG&A. This quarter, we gained operating leverage in SG&A keeping its growth well below our top line growth. We continue to invest for the future in research and development, maintaining our R&D investment level at around 6% to 7% of top line revenue. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region, we had very strong sales performance in Q2, with our commercial team driving to 17% growth in a competitive market. Flow generator growth in the region was 23%, reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms powered and catalyzed by Air Solutions software. The mask and accessories categories grew at a solid 11% in the Americas for Q2. We continue to expect solid mask and accessories growth throughout fiscal year 2016 and beyond. We grew our combined EMEA and APAC group at 7% on a constant currency basis in Q2. We continue to see good growth in our sleep disorder breathing business and our respiratory care businesses in these regions. The headwinds that we have faced from the SERVE-HF trial results of May 2015m continued to be annualized through the P&L and this will continue until May 2016. The ASV sales impact for Q2 in Europe was broadly consistent with last quarter. As we noted during our last quarter investor call, the ASV sales impact in the U.S. continues to be less than that in Europe. The ASV platform remains an excellent therapeutic solution for a number of important clinical applications including one, treatment emergent central sleep apnea; two, opiod or pain management induced central sleep apnea; three, post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. This quarter, we acquired Maribo Medico, our distributor in Denmark. These forward vertical integration acquisitions have proved very valuable to us in the past, we expect this to be the same. We also expect that our partnership with the great team at Maribo which is now part of ResMed Denmark will allow us to continue to lead in market development in the country and to build connected care and digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond. Now, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. Before going to the three horizons, I\u2019d like to talk about three key underlying enablers of our strategy. The first of these is our global leadership in healthcare informatics, the second is our expansion in high growth geographic markets, and the third is a focus on our best in class operational excellence. So, the first enabler on our list is our global leadership in healthcare informatics. Connected care and digital health are almost now industry buzzwords that are referred to by many companies in the space. We\u2019re not just talking about it, we\u2019re executing on this front with over 1 million cloud connected medical devices, sending data every morning to the cloud, and more than 750 patients signing up every day for our patient application called myAir. We are transforming ResMed into a tech-driven medical device leader. Our first step on this journey has been changing the basis of competition in our core sleep apnea business. We led the industry 15 months ago with 100% cloud connected medical devices and now our competition has had to follow. We are improving the efficiency of our customers by embedding our software solutions in their work flow and providing value to providers, physicians and patients by improving patient device adherence and therefore patient outcomes. We can leverage this core competency from sleep apnea into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD into neuromuscular disease and other chronic disease spaces. Our second enabler is our investment and expansion in high growth geographies. Our investment in Curative last quarter is an example of this strategy in action. Curative allows us to have products developed in China, made in China for sale in China. It opens up channels that just weren\u2019t available for imported products. We\u2019ll continue to invest and expand our presence in China, South Korea, India, Brazil and many countries in Eastern Europe. In each country, the value we deliver is to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs for the country in key chronic diseases. Our third enabler is operational excellence. It is an important and fundamental foundation to our growth strategy. It\u2019s just part of our DNA. We continue to create efficiencies to allow us to free up cash, to invest back into innovative organic R&D programs and also allow us to better unlock value from our tuck-in acquisitions. We take a continuous improvement approach across our entire global business including component supply management, manufacturing excellence, supply chain and logistics optimization, and OpEx management. We are committed to grow our operating profit and to ensure that we have headroom to free up cash to reinvest in the business and continue to drive profitable growth. Now, I would like to spend a few minutes updating you on progress against our long-term ResMed 2020 growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth which includes our core sleep apnea franchise, our leadership in healthcare informatics remains a critical growth driver. Last month a market research firm, Berg Insight published a report on mobile health and home monitoring. The report ranked ResMed as the number one global leader in connected care for all medical devices. This was not just in respiratory medicine but in all device categories including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and beyond. So 15 months after the launch of AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, and Air Solutions the cloud based softer platform, we have achieved this market leadership position. I want to tell you that we are not done. We intend to continue our leadership in connected care and digital health as we add features and enhancements to our solution to bring even more value for providers and physicians, and even better applications for patients to see their own data, to participate more in their own health and wellness. With well over 1 million patients, cloud connected medical devices sitting on their bedside tables providing daily updates to the cloud, we are liberating data, providing actionable information, unlocking value, and improving outcomes for patients, physicians, providers and for payors. Our customers are clearly experiencing the value proposition of the AirSense and Air Solutions platform and incorporating this into their workflows, and reaping cost savings in their own P&L. On an investor call last year, I referenced a clinical care study that was presented at the American Thoracic Society in which an Air Solutions customers saw patient adherence increase from 73% to 83%, along with the 59% decrease in their own labor costs. Earlier this month, this clinical care study was published in the peer reviewed journal called Sleep and Breathing. We continue to deliver results like this for many of our customers. And many of these are proprietary results that we just cannot share. One study that I was committed to share at the JP Morgan health care conference in San Francisco earlier this month, showed an increase from a very solid baseline of 60% adherence for our customer, the standard care up to top tier patient adherence of 87% when using our cloud-based Air Solutions platform. You will see further publications and evidence from us showing increased operating efficiencies for our customers and increased patient adherence like this, all enabled Air Solutions. Connected care is here to stay. Our acquisitions of Jaysec and CareTouch have added both ResMed branded resupply solutions combined with an end to end referral and document management system for our customers. Our system provides automated resupply solutions to customers, so that they can effectively manage ongoing supplies of masks and accessories to patients via automated text, via e-mail, and even via interactive voice response. We also have a multilingual call center backing up the solution. The referral and document management capability reduces days patient and position sign off, reduces the number of errors and incomplete documents, and eliminates a large number of follow-up phone calls. These systems improve both our homecare customers efficiencies and just as importantly, their cash flow. In terms of progress against the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we announced the acquisition of Austin, Taxes based Inova Labs which we plan to complete this quarter. With this acquisition, we have expanded our therapeutic portfolio to COPD, to include portable oxygen concentrators or POCs. POCs enable patient mobility and fit well with our life support ventilator platform called Astral. Both of these give increased mobility and increased freedom back to COPD patients. Inova Labs fits well with our respiratory care strategy and our innovative company culture here at ResMed. We know that we can manage the business to add to ResMed shareholder value. We even know that we will have opportunities to grow revenue by selling POCs through our global market channels. We will work to prioritize the 100 countries that we sell into maximize physician, provider, and patient value. We will also be able to bring global operational and technological capability to create economies of scale in supply chain management, manufacturing and logistics at Inova Labs. Finally, together with the team in research and development in Austin and Sydney and beyond, we can create next generation products that leverage our healthcare informatics leadership to create solutions for connected care for COPD. Finally, I would like to review our third horizon of growth. Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of opportunities in new markets including atrial fibrillation, nocturnal asthma, and also sleep health and wellness. Rob and I and others from our team attended the Consumer Electronics Show or CES earlier this month in Las Vegas. Almost every variable and non-variable health and wellness technology at CES included sleep as part of their offering. This clearly shows that there is a demand from consumers to measure, monitor and improve their sleep. Our S+ by ResMed sleep wellness tool is just our first foray into this space. Consumers realize that sleep health is as important as cardiovascular exercise and good nutrition for overall health, and we agree. We also continue to explore clinical areas of interest in adjacent market. For our more than 26-year history, our team at ResMed has emphasized relationships with key opinion leaders in pulmonology, cardiology, neurology and related clinical areas. Through our recent $5 million gift to the University of California at San Diego, we have helped to establish a world leading center for clinical care and medical research in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD, the two most costly and most important clinic diseases in the field of respiratory medicine. You will see plenty of exciting developments in the field from this team. One recent example was a sleep apnea and cancer symposium at UCSD that worked together key opinion leaders in pulmonology with KOLs from oncology to discuss the impacts of sleep disorder breathing and specifically repetitive hypoxia on cancer cell development. Although these discussions are still in their early days, literally at the molecular level, this is just one of many new clinical areas that could lead to new therapeutics and solutions for patients that ResMed could provide in the future. So returning back to our quarterly results, we remain active on the capital management front. And this quarter in Q2, we bought back 700,000 shares. In addition to funding our dividend and completing the acquisitions of Curative Medical and Maribo Medico. We continue to look for potential acquisitions where these three criteria are met : One, the business is aligned with our long-term ResMed 2020 drug strategy; two, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed shareholder value; and three, really importantly, that there is a cultural fit between the business team and ResMed. We clearly hit and nailed all of these three criteria with our acquisition of Inova and our acquisition of Maribo. And we will continue to refresh our acquisition radar screen with further growth opportunities as we move forward. We are the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but more importantly in products and solutions innovation in connected care. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly for patients all around the world. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q2 financials. Brett? Brett Sandercock : Thanks, Mick. Revenue for December quarter was $454.5 million, an increase of 7% over prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $21.7 million in the second quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $269.5 million, an increase of 17% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and APAC totaled $185 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. However in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and APAC increased by 7% over the prior year quarter. Breaking our revenue between product segments, Americas flow generator sales were $136.5 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $133 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and APAC, flow generator sales were $123.5 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $61.4 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 14% while masks and other increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we incurred restructure expenses of $6.9 million associated with rationalizing our European R&D and manufacturing facility. These operations have been integrated in their existing largest care locations. Restructure charge consists primarily of severance payments and an asset write down of a legacy manufacturing facility. Additionally, during the quarter, we released $2.4 million of an accrual associated with our SERVE-HF field safety notice activity, as we substantially conclude the obligation arising from the field safety notification. During the rest of my commentary today, I\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of restructure expenses and the SERVE-HF accrual released in the current quarter, as well as the amortization of acquired intangibles, both in the current year and last year. We\u2019ve reconciled the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Non-GAAP gross margin for the December quarter was 58.1%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 410 basis points, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, declines in average selling prices, and an unfavorable geographic mix partially offset by favorable net currency movements. However, on a sequential basis, non-GAAP gross margin improved slightly increasing from 58% in the September quarter. Given current exchange rates and taking into account the current trending products and geographic mix combined with the impact from our cost out programs and our recent acquisitions, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 57% to 60% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016. Moving onto operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $118.2 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 26% compared to the year ago figure of 29%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $29 million a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year ago figure of 6.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitments to investing in our diverse product pipeline including informatics solutions, but also a benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $4.4 million for the quarter. The increase over the prior amortization expense of $2.2 million reflects the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisition. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.5 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year will be in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $116.9 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $97.5 million, also an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $9.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.69, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter while diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted second earnings by $0.04 per share, reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar, partially offset by the weaker euro. Cash flow from operations was a record $147.4 million for the quarter, this reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in the net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.9 million while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $21.5 million. We continue to be active on the capital management front. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, additionally during the quarter we repurchased 700,000 shares for consideration of $40.1 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. During the quarter we completed three international acquisitions, Curative Medical based in China; Maribo Medico, our distributor in Denmark; and then a precision tooling company located in Sydney. These acquisitions were funded by utilizing our existing cash balances. Additionally, this month, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Inova Labs. Inova Labs is a U.S. domiciled entity and this acquisition will be funded by utilizing our existing credit facility. We expect to include Inova Labs in our consolidated results in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. For the rolling 12 months ended December 31, we returned 84% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Over the last five years, we\u2019ve returned 98% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balance at the end of the quarter was $257 million while December 31 total assets stood at $2.2 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion. And with that I\u2019ll hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question please. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Susan, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I was hoping to start off on the generator side and the performance in this quarter again very, very strong. Just curious as far as what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace with this product now out there today, are you guys competing head to head? And if so, it seems like you\u2019re continuing to be very successful. Is that a trend that we should expect going forward. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, that allows us to talk about our Air Solutions portfolio and AirSense 10 and how it fits in the market. I\u2019ll have a first go and then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead to talk a little bit about Americas business and what\u2019s happening there with the AirSense 10 launch. So, as I said in the remarks earlier, we have had competitors follow us into the space with the cloud-connected devices. We think our offering is superior because it\u2019s 100% cloud-connected and requires a channel to do nothing other than plug it in and breath, and in the morning the data go to the cloud, and then can be accessed by the patient on myAir or the physician on AirView or the payor provider through an API from Air Solutions. And we think it\u2019s a really strong value proposition taking up to 60% of the labor costs out of the channel for them. And it\u2019s just a really important improvement to their P&L. And it\u2019s really embedded in their workflow and becomes something that they are doing well. We believe in competition; we like healthy competition; and we like the fact that our competitors are looking to compete on value offerings, not just in the flow generators segment but in the masks segment and looking to compete with technology. And so, as we look forward, the market growth rate is in the mid to high single digit numbers. We like to meet or beat market growth rate; we don\u2019t except it, we drive beyond that. That\u2019s sort of where we are at. But Jim, anymore color on the Americas? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks Mick. We are very confident in our offering. I mean the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms have been very, very well-received. We have taken lot of -- we\u2019ve taken a significant market share and the Air Solutions inclusion in that. So, as Mick is saying, I think we\u2019ve now clearly proven to our customers that we can drive efficiencies in their business with the platform. So that\u2019s a very compelling offer, remains a very compelling offer, even in right of competitor launches. We obviously have big comps that we are going to work through. And so your question was about sustainability, we intend to continue to grow our program, position above market growth rate. But given the share we\u2019ve taken, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s sustainable indefinitely, [ph] the growth rate you\u2019ve seen this quarter. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up, talking about the Inova acquisition, just curious as far as where they were selling historically and where you can take that device fairly quickly? And then the investments that you\u2019re going to need to make in support of it, is activity pretty sizable and then how does that business affect the financial make up of ResMed? I think that the gross margin profile and operating margin profile likely be somewhat of a headwind going forward. Mick Farrell : Thanks Matt. The Inova acquisition is a great opportunity for us; it\u2019s our first foray after 26 years of positive airway pressure, noninvasive ventilation, and dental treatment, so our first foray into portable oxygen concentrators. And it\u2019s a great technology, has great mobility and gives great freedom back in terms of the battery life and the weight of these portable oxygen concentrators. Yes, when you look at our scale and selling into 100 countries, Inova currently sales into five to maybe 10 countries. So, you\u2019ve got a 10 to 20x multiple, just on the number of geographic countries that we can move into. And so, we are really excited about it. I might ask Rob -- Rob Douglas, our COO, President and Chief Operating Officer and I were touring the plant in Austin last week just before JP Morgan and it was great to walk around and see all the team and to get a feel for the innovation. Rob, any further comments as to the investments and what we need to do going forward? Rob Douglas : Yes. I mean obviously Inova is at a scale not where ResMed is at but they are at a scale that ResMed use to be at. And so, walking around the factory, there\u2019s lot of a very similar approaches to what ResMed have taken in the early days. And we know that we can actually share a lot of experiences and working and integrating those teams, we can really accelerate the development of way that -- way those products go and how we take them into the market. Huge amount of opportunity there, really good cultural fit; it\u2019s going to be very exciting for us all to work in that area. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, your line is open. David Low : First, I just had a question around pricing, I mean really there has been the experience of competitive bidding round two and what that led to and how the manufacturer process, just wondering what your experience has been as we head into international roll out of competitive bidding? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Dave. Competitive bidding has been in play for almost seven years now, CB1, CB2 and then the national expansion that is going on, as we speak from January 1 through July 1. So, these obviously have had an impact. We have talked about that over the last number of quarters on our customers, and we have worked with our customers to make sure that we can help them approve the efficiencies of their P&L and drive to a profitable growth through all of this in the value chain so that we can continue to serve patients and invest in infrastructure. A lot of our investments around Air Solutions are about taking 50%, 60% of the cost -- the labor cost out of the channel and so therefore improving the P&L. Obviously acquisition price hold [indiscernible] are in their P&L as well but when you\u2019re able to take 60% of the labor cost that frees up a lot of cash for reinvestment in their business. And it\u2019s really bringing a technology solution into apply. I would characterize the pricing environment as historic normal and what it has been over the last number of many years. We don\u2019t go to quantitative detail of that for competitive purposes, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s at historic normal levels. David Low : I think to follow up on the same topic, I guess what I\u2019m looking for is a little bit of comfort that what we saw with right round two where I think your commentary was quite similar at this after just announced that we\u2019re not -- or that you\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re not going to see [ph] the dynamic with the competitors I think in -- the competitors push pricing down and raise ResMed in due course followed. Are you concerned that there is a risk of that playing out gain or... Mick Farrell : Yes Dave, I can\u2019t predict the psychology of other players in the market. I can tell you what we\u2019ve done and what we continue to do, which is we bring technology into play that improves the P&L for our value chain. And we really understand how that value chain operates. And we\u2019ve got embedded into the workflows and really helped partner with industry to take those costs out. And we will continue to do that in the future. Other players in the marketplace have followed and produced similar technologies. We don\u2019t think they are quite as good but they\u2019re doing similar things which is looking to take labor costs and inefficiencies out of a system. And frankly, together we aimed our competitors in the space, are fighting the real competitor, which is frequent [ph] in the hospital and getting those patients with sleep apnea and COPD rather than going back to the ER taking care of them by product on bedside table and using data from that to get back to the hospital system, back to the API system, so that they know that they kept out of play. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Chris Kallos of Morningstar is on line with the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Kallos : Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask in light of the acquisitions and Inova in Denmark, how does that affect your CapEx going forward? Can you provide some you guidance on that? Mick Farrell : Brett, do you want to take that question? Brett Sandercock : I mean it\u2019s the CapEx that sort of run at around -- let\u2019s go to sort of run rate 13, 14, 15 in the quarter something like that. In terms of Maribo, it\u2019s very much a distributor, so it\u2019s not a lot of [indiscernible] product that one, so I don\u2019t see too much impact there. To move to things like Inova, probably be a small uptick but pretty negligible, fairly small operation at the moment. I think the big one on that in terms of investment, they\u2019re not big; where we\u2019ll incrementally put some money I think is in R&D, really think we can turbo-charge those products and them very effective. And obviously with our distribution channel capability, what we can bring to the table, we very much think that we can grow that business very nicely. So, pretty -- some small investments but nothing significant. Chris Kallos : And just a follow-up on the R&D in Inova, are you planning on keeping that domiciled in the U.S. and how does that affect your 6% to 7% forecast on R&D? Mick Farrell : Rob, do you want to take that question maybe or -- we have Rob, why don\u2019t you go first and then maybe Brett can answer. Rob Douglas : We\u2019re still working on integration plans and finalizing how that\u2019s going to work. But we don\u2019t see in the short-term major moves. It\u2019s a really good team in Austin, who really know the stuff around that and they have confidence and we\u2019re very keen to maximize the value of that. In terms of ongoing [indiscernible] made a short-term bit of investment in the R&D, but long-term that shouldn\u2019t change how we think about the right level of investment for R&D for our overall business. Operator : Anthony Petrone with Jefferies is online with the questions. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Great, thanks a lot. One quick for Brett and then I\u2019ll follow-up with the question on just some CMS news that was coming out late last year. Just Brett on the acquisitions in the quarter, they were three that -- one was we were aware of but the other two in terms of distributor work or integration we were not aware of. So what was the collective contribution just from those three acquisitions in the quarter in terms of revenue and EPS? And then one follow-up. Thanks. Brett Sandercock : Yes, I mean these are pretty small acquisitions, so not going down to that granularity. I think we did for those ones, not material from our perspective, so we haven\u2019t disclosed too much detail on that. Anthony Petrone : And then just from a margin perspective, this vertical integration, will that help offset some of the pressures that you\u2019ve been seeing? And maybe just an update on the transition from I guess area of freight charges which was a tailwind that was potentially coming in the second half of this year. Was there any benefit from that this quarter or do you expect that to be more of a second half event? Brett Sandercock : So, just on the first one, it really -- continuing on the acquisitions, they\u2019re fairly small, so that\u2019s kind of around the ages. But typically with the vertical integration for example in the distribution, that would help, that would sort of be if you like help improve your margins or be accretive to your margin for example. If you look at benefit [ph] example that\u2019s really vertical integration within our supplies and we think we can pick up obviously, it\u2019s for better tooling cost but also improvements in strategically in markets and things like that. So that was what we call it\u2019s not strategic tuck in for us. If you look at acquisitions such as Inova, and I think we highlighted that at the time, there will be a little bit of dilution to gross margin there. So that does present a little bit of a headwind but I think the opportunities are so good for us on that on growing that portable oxygen and concentrator market and our share in the product and so on that I think it was quite compelling for us to do so. We weren\u2019t going to worry about sort of, some sort of myAir margin dilution if you like impact, from not doing the deal, we think it will be pretty compelling in due course. And on the freight side of things, we\u2019re seeing some of that coming through and obviously we will see more of that coming through in the second half as well of the fiscal. Operator : And Saul Hadassin of Credit Suisse is on line. Please go ahead, your line is open. Saul Hadassin : Thanks very much. Maybe question for Brett as well, on gross margins, jus looking the sequential movement up about 10 basis points. Looking at your mix, product mix, if anything is probably slightly better this quarter than 1Q \u201816. You should had a benefit from a lower Aussie U.S. sort of line, just wondering was there anything holding back that gross margin uplift? For example what was the reference before so that moved to -- is that still to come through? In terms of your underlying gross margin ex the dilution that might come from the Inova just wondering should you -- should we think sequential gross margin uplift over the course of this fiscal year assuming currently holds where it is? Thanks. Brett Sandercock : Yes, I mean it\u2019s a little sequentially; we still are seeing an impact on -- negative impact from product mix and also geographic mix. And of course I mean the big standouts obviously you know Americas growth and then the flow generator growth as well, that remains really strong. So, there\u2019s still headwinds for us but in the frame there\u2019s a whole bunch of other stuff. We had a small uplift from FX, you\u2019re right, that was probably around 40 basis points or so. There\u2019s a bunch of other -- there\u2019s other stuff that plays out on that that can impact you kind of quarter to quarter. But overall, I guess you\u2019d characterize that as kind of margins pretty much stabilized. And depending on trends, on product mix and geographic mix I suppose the term is kind of where we land within that kind of guidance band that I gave. So, still working on a way on the cost out programs and so on. We\u2019ve got opportunities there, will flow through into the second half. But then it does -- it depends a lot on the normal product mix, geographic mix, a little bit on the acquisition around the edges, a little of a headwind for us. You\u2019ve got typical declines or mix. So, that\u2019s all in and I said a lot -- quite a lot, it\u2019s pretty hard to predict on the gross margin when you\u2019re looking at kind of 90-day window. But overall I think pretty comfortable with that margin even and clearly we\u2019ll work hard to improve that but we\u2019ve got to be realistic on what we\u2019re seeing with product mix and geographic mix and acquisitions and so on. So rest assured we\u2019re working hard on margin improvement. Saul Hadassin : And just a follow-up on that regarding the ASV sales that you would have not had this quarter, was there any material change to those lost sales relative to the quarter that\u2019s just passed, so relative to 1Q \u201816? Mick Farrell : The ASV sales, as I said earlier, the impact that we saw in Q2 was the same as the impact we saw pretty much in Q1 for Europe. And the impact that we saw in the U.S. was much less than that that we saw in Europe which is again the identical situation to what we saw in Q1, so that you know it\u2019s still going through the P&L being annualized. The impact of SERVE-HF results from May 2015 and we\u2019re in mid January now, so we\u2019ve got four more months of annualizing that through the P&L and then we\u2019ll be clear with sort of annual cost of the ASV impact in May 2016 here in five months -- four months time from now. Operator : And Margaret Kaczor of William Blair is online with a question. Please go ahead, your line is open. Margaret Kaczor : So just to go back to Inova Labs and that acquisition, obviously they have a good product, they\u2019ve got some good advantages. But that said, do you have an interest in bringing a new POC to market, that\u2019s up to the same standards as ResMed, similar to what you guys did with Astral and Sans [ph] and should this be a shorter or longer timeframe or are you happy and willing to continue selling the existing products to your customers today? Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks Margaret, good afternoon to you. That\u2019s a good question. It allows us to talk to the longer term play here around Inova. So, Inova is a strong player in the POC market and they have excellent mobility and excellent freedom that they give back to patients because the battery life is best in class and lasts a very long time, similar to what we do with the Astral, lots of what where did 24 hours of freedom back to patients with that. Having said all that and as Rob alluded to earlier, there\u2019s a lot of capabilities that we have from our global business in the 26 years in respiratory medicine here that we can bring some skills to the table for the next generation of products in the portable oxygen concentrator front. And some of that will be some of the engineering around efficiencies, our supply chain logistics, manufacturing, quality reliability and those types of factors that we\u2019ve learned a lot. But really importantly bringing the capability or the core confidence of cloud based healthcare informatics solutions to the able to put a cloud-connected POC as part of end-to-end across the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medical device space, so all the way from noninvasive ventilators, life support ventilators and the portable oxygen concentrators and take that data and be able to give pulmonary and critical care physicians or ACOs data that can really help them understand mobility, freedom, breath right and hospitalization rights of their COPD patients to help them improve outcomes and lower cost. That\u2019s the game. And we do think that we can bring a lot to the table. So the short answer is obviously we like the product, we will continue to sell existing products. But we like even more the combination of the Inova portable oxygen concentrator engineering with ResMed\u2019s healthcare informatics engraining, what the two combinations, what that synergy could bring. Margaret Kaczor : Okay, then I don\u2019t know if you had talked at all about the timeframe because obviously it took you guys a little bit a time, sense to bring that kind of a product to market, so should we assume it\u2019s within that 2020 timeframe or longer than that? Mick Farrell : You should assume it within the 2020 timeframe for sure. Yes, the difference between stand, we have got life support ventilators where the life cycle of those is sort of six to seven or even up to eight to 10 years. The life cycle of a portable oxygen concentrator is probably closer to that of the C peptide type device or that sort of time horizon. So yes, we will have a next generation well before 2020. Operator : And Joanne Wuensch of BMO Securities is on line with the question. Go ahead, your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Could we touch on SG&A please? Revenue was stronger than we expected but you really also pulled in your SG&A what\u2019s going on there? Mick Farrell : Rob, do you want to just set maybe -- maybe Rob first, Brett and then you can go. Rob Douglas : Joanne, actually we\u2019ve got a number of areas that we are working on. Brett will probably go into few of them but across the board we are running a really strong operational excellence program that not only talks about our products and our supply chain, which we have talked about a lot but we are also moving a lot of that thinking and approach into our SG&A road as well. And so we have done a lot work around the world. We do run our different countries with different go to market models and so the different programs around the world. But we can really call out the U.S. and Americas teams of pulling a lot of operational leverage in and we have got very strong plans around our European teams. So, it\u2019s really easy stuff for us to do, in terms of sharing the way some things work nice and easier. And we are taking a view of that we are freeing up a lot of capacity to continue to invest in innovation and really optimizing these acquisitions as well. So Brett, I don\u2019t know if you want to go into little more on some of the areas. Brett Sandercock : Yes. We\u2019ve adopted to some extent some of the methodologies that they are using with the supply management team and so and being more disciplined around that. So that\u2019s certainly helping a lot and just making sure kind of mindset is thinking to that extent as well in a smart way. And so that\u2019s sort of enabled us to get some pretty solid leverage there. Obviously if you go back last year running, we had for example AirSense and selling and doing some marketing and some variable compensation, that\u2019s more normalized this year, which has helped us a bit as well. And to some extent, you\u2019re getting some currency benefit as well. But even if I normalize for currency, we still -- we see around that 27% mark. So, we\u2019d still be in very good shape, some of those savings or kind of holding expenses tight. And then with revenue growth obviously you get that leverage. So that\u2019s been -- we\u2019ve been working on this for a while and I think it\u2019s just sort of starting to flow through into the P&L now. Joanne Wuensch : And just as a follow-up if I may, I think there is some pricing on Inova clearly going outside of your core OSA type of area into more sort of traditional DME type of oxygen concentrators, what made this be the right acquisition at this time? Thank you. Mick Farrell : With respect to -- I\u2019ll disagree that it\u2019s not in our space. Our space is -- ResMed is respiratory medicine. And what we have done in the field of sleep apnea certainly for 25 years is lead that market, and most recently lead it by taking cost out through healthcare informatics and really showing we can improve the efficiencies of the delivery of this amazing noninvasive ventilation and positive airway pressure therapy to patients in sleep apnea. We\u2019d already started within the fields of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with our noninvasive ventilators to help those patients as well, stay out of hospital and get better with COPD through noninvasive ventilation including publication of studies showing that we can actually reduce the mortality rate, so literally save lives of COPD patients with severe hypercapnic COPD with noninvasive ventilation through the current one study that we published. So the extension through that vertical, if you like of the disease state of COPD into the other medical device that is often used in that COPD space which is oxygen therapy. Now, we aren\u2019t really doubling down in stationary oxygen, and it does have a stationary oxygen concentrator but it\u2019s actually the only one in the world that the stationary oxygen concentrator can allow a portable oxygen concentrator to connect directly on to it and charge and be there, so that when the patient wants to leave the home. Because these folks are still active folks with COPD, they can grab the POC and see the grand children, get out to the park and play ball with the grand kids and have the freedom back, which is what POC is bringing. The total market for oxygen therapy is $1.2 billion or so, of that around $200 million plus or minus is a portable oxygen concentrator market, but it\u2019s that $200 million portable oxygen concentrator market that has very strong growth, mid to high, even low-double-digit numbers growth in terms of year-over-year. We are really excited to participate in that POC market and to bring our innovation play. And we think it\u2019s a very larger to extension into the vertical of COPD patient treatment and it will become a good -- a great part of our portfolio, not just in the U.S. where it primarily sales now, but globally. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall, UBS. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall : Just want to pick up on the mask, obviously it\u2019s second quarter now that you\u2019ve achieved quite good U.S. sales. Just want to understand sort of what\u2019s been behind that; is conversion or I guess better pairings; is again conversion on the compliance rate that data that you\u2019re showing? And then I guess Brett\u2019s probably covered this a little bit, but just how I guess incrementally that continues remarkably that in the margin? Mick Farrell : Okay. I\u2019ll hand the first part of the question. 11% solid growth in masks and accessories in Americas and hand to Jim Hollingshead and then Brett maybe you take the second part of that. Jim Hollingshead : Yes. There is a lot going on behind that mask number, just to be -- try to think about it. And the first thing is the price reductions that we\u2019ve put into place in January to June [indiscernible] now completely annualized. So we\u2019re through that. And while the market remains, the mask market in particular remains very competitive, we\u2019re into more of a historic norm kind of pricing situation in masks. Our offering remains very strong in particular the AirFit line of masks are very well received and continues to do very, very well in the market. Our recent buy offerings have driven a lot of growth and that is directly connected to our health informatics offering because the acquisition of the providers that we\u2019re now integrating into a program we called ResMed Resupply and that\u2019s an automated resupply program, it\u2019s part of our HI offering that\u2019s helping to grow our mask business. And then we\u2019ve done a number of things. We\u2019ve done a number of -- without getting into the tactics, a number of things in marketing and a number of things with sales compensation and so on, and all of those leverages have contributed to the growth we saw. Andrew Goodsall : And what you\u2019re expecting gross margin\u2026[Multiple Speakers] Mick Farrell : Yes. Brett, you want to address the -- actually sort of a third question, why don\u2019t you addresss the gross margin and then Jim or I will address the ongoing masks... Brett Sandercock : So pretty simply, typically mask margins are higher than flow gen margins. So, to the extent you get stronger growth in mask obviously be supportive to group margin. So that\u2019s kind of the pricing masks. Jim Hollingshead : And in terms of where it goes, I think all the activities we have in place would suggest that that\u2019s stable. Operator : Steve Wheen of JP Morgan is online with the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Wheen : Well, thanks very much. The question for Brett, just on the FX typically in the positive given some indication on current exchange rates, what the gross margin impact might be going into third quarter? And then also you\u2019ve often provided the FX impact at the impact [ph] line as well? Brett Sandercock : Yes. So on gross margin going forward, assuming currently the way they are and they\u2019re particularly volatile at the moment. But we probably sequentially probably get a small uptick but it will be only around 10 basis-point mark Steve, it\u2019d be pretty small sequentially that is point in time. I mean all the sort of types it will be the trajectory and stays there and probably Q4 you\u2019d see that impact on a sequential basis being a little bit bigger than Q3, but for Q3 I think it would be around 10 basis points. So kind of overall net impact from currencies, I do typically give it on EPS. And I think even the commentary was around [indiscernible] this quarter, as we\u2019re starting to see some of that benefit from a lower Aussie dollar kind of kicking through, which is offset to some extent by the way to euro, but we are starting to see the benefit from the Aussie dollar now which is great. Steve D. Wheen: And then just final follow-up. In the past, in the last quarter, you guided towards the effective tax rate going down by 100 basis points. You seem to sort of have changed the stats on that. Could you just give some reconciliation as to what might have changed there? Brett Sandercock : It\u2019s seats around the cost of H1, so probably in the vicinity of 20; it\u2019s around that range Steve, on that. And just it varies around with the basically where the geographically taxable income is. And so we continue to have pretty good numbers out of the U.S. and that\u2019s probably sort of moved it up a little bit. But in the vicinity of that 20%, I\u2019ve just gone with 20 to 21. So maybe sort increase that a shade above where I was thinking from Q1. Operator : And your next question is Sean Laaman on line from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sean Laaman : I have a question on myAir, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any way you\u2019ve been able to track or quantify the uptake and usage patterns from patients and any observable benefit to the company? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Great question, Sean. I mentioned that it\u2019s actually now in our investor deck that we\u2019re adding 750 patients per day to the myAir application. And myAir for those who don\u2019t know is an app that can run on an iPhone or an Android, Samsung or whatever device, portable device where a patient can access and interact with their own therapeutic data from their device and trends and gaming and interaction with it. And in the same way that many people around the world are now measuring their steps either with a Fitbit or an embedded app in their Smartphone to try and get the 10,000 steps a day and keep the cardiovascular exercise up. A lot of patients now with myAir are looking to get their score to 100, because we literally give a score out of 100 everyday on how you slept. This includes duration of sleep, probably mask week and efficacy of the respiratory rate and so on throughout the evening. So, it\u2019s an algorithm, if you like that score the patient\u2019s wellness with regard to sleep and their treatment sleep apnea. We\u2019ve seen incredible engagement from patients on it. I talked about 60% adherence going up to 87% adherence with some customers in the case studies from the JP Morgan presentation. I\u2019d tell you a big part of that is engagement with the patients through these cloud-based algorithms that interact, email, text, IVR and psychologically work with patients through these cloud-based capabilities. So we\u2019re really excited about myAir and we think it\u2019s a big contributor. And we\u2019re in mile one of a mask on this one. There\u2019s a long way to go onto the capability for us to engage with patients. Operator : Your last question in today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Go ahead your line is open. Matt Taylor : So, I just wanted to ask you a follow-up on the acquisitions because you\u2019re talking about them very excitedly but also they\u2019re immaterial this quarter. You said Curative was about 1% last quarter, so two things. One is when do they become material as engines more material and then are you going to call them out separately for reporting purposes because most of us just have masks and flow generator models, so it\u2019s hard to recognize. Mick Farrell : So, I\u2019ll let Brett talk to the first part of that materiality and then I\u2019ll talk into a little bit as to why we\u2019re excited about the long term. Brett Sandercock : So, at this stage I mean it\u2019s still not material from accounting stands and even on that aggregate there Matt, so at this stage we wouldn\u2019t -- won\u2019t disclose that in sort of any too much granularity. Now obviously, as we go forward and so on we\u2019ll keep looking at how we report or disclose from a business perspective. But at this stage we\u2019re going through pretty much the same channels and so on, we\u2019ll continue to basically aggregate that into our results and not try to split that out. Mick Farrell : And Matt, just to give you some sort of ballpark on it, we have mentioned that it\u2019s less than 2% of our global revenues, so you can run the math on $1.7 billion that puts it at less than $34 million in revenues. We\u2019re not going to go into exactly what number it is for competitive reasons. But take that number and then also think about the $200 million marker of POCs and think about what ResMed\u2019s done, I guess if you look back over the last 20-25 years in the sleep apnea market where we started from a very small base and have grown to a very strong global leadership, number one position. We would look to do the same in POCs and how we look to do that is the same way we did in sleep apnea, which is innovation and technology. And I talked a lot about the innovation in healthcare informatics and engaging patients. Applying that to POCs we think is a huge opportunity and we\u2019re very excited about being a major player in the POC market, and really importantly rolling that up to a major play around COPD, which is the number three killer in the United States, and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in ERs and ICUs and CCUs. So we think it\u2019s a huge opportunity and we look to be a part of that. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks Susan. So, in closing I want to thank the more than 4,300 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath. I\u2019m very proud of what our team has accomplished in creating market leading innovation and connected care, including new product lines, new solutions, new channels that we\u2019ve incorporated into our business portfolio. We remain laser focused on our long-term goal of impacting 20 million lives by 2020. And that impact is literally giving the gift of breath back to each of those patients. Thanks for your time and we\u2019ll talk to you in 90 days. Agnes Lee : All right, thank you again for joining us today for this call. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investors.resmed.com. Susan, you may now close the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes ResMed\u2019s second quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Andrew and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance.  We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we summarize our results for the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2016. We delivered solid global growth this quarter led by strong double-digit growth in the Americas region. We made progress executing on our respiratory care strategy by closing our acquisition of Inova Labs early in the quarter.  We also made significant progress executing on our connected care strategy by closing our acquisition of Brightree on April 4. For the call today, I\u2019ll first review our top and bottom-line results. I\u2019ll then outline some regional highlights from our business, and finally, I\u2019ll review our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. After that I will hand the call over to Brett to walk you through our financials in greater detail.  We have seen strong ongoing success with our global leadership in connected care. For the seventh quarter in a row, our global team achieved market beating topline revenue growth. We exhibited continued strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth at 12% year-on-year. These results were fueled by the ongoing success of Air Solutions, our cloud based connected care software system, as well as the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 medical device platforms.  We achieved steady growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions, despite the headwind for macroeconomic conditions in Europe. At the bottom line, our diluted earnings-per-share was $0.68 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 5% year-on-year growth. We continue to balance solid revenue growth with ongoing investments in R&D innovation and our global focus on operating excellence. This quarter we gained operating leverage in SG&A keeping its growth well below our topline revenue growth.  We are investing for the future, maintaining R&D spend at 6% to 7% of our topline revenue. These R&D investments are focused on enhancing our growing portfolio of sleep apnea, COPD, and connected care solutions. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region we had very strong sales performance in Q3 with our commercial team in that region driving 12% growth against very tough year-on-year comparables. Flow generator growth was 15% in the Americas reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10, our AirCurve 10 platforms, but all powered by our cloud based Air Solutions software including the U-Sleep and myAir apps.  The mask and accessories category also grew very well, we have achieved double-digit growth for the last three quarters in this category with 10% growth in the Americas for Q3 in masks and accessories. We continue to expect solid mask and accessories growth as we move forward. We grew our combined EMEA and APAC group at 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We saw solid growth in sleep apnea platforms and our respiratory care offerings in the regions. It is important to note that the ASV growth headwind from the SERVE-HF announcement in 2015 was significant on a year-on-year basis in Q3. The studies announcement anniversary is May 13, 2016, so we will pass that date in just a few weeks here, after which, those headwinds will begin to subside. ASV growth will remain an issue in Q4 with the largest impact on the EMEA and APAC region. We continue to see opportunities for ASV in central sleep apnea, especially in those patients with complex sleep apnea, with pain management medication and also with posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. These all provide a basis for very good growth in ASV for 2017 and beyond. Now, I would like to provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. We're making good progress with all three foundations that allow us to drive our strategy. As a reminder, these three foundations are, one our global leadership in healthcare informatics; two, our investment and expansion in high-growth geographic markets; and three, a strong focus on best-in-class talent development, as well as global excellence. We continue to make great progress with our global leadership in healthcare informatics. This is truly a core competence for ResMed team and a source of sustainable competitive advantage. With the close of the Brightree acquisition we're continuing to invest in cloud-based computing solutions. These solutions help make our customers more efficient and help them free up cash flow to invest in even better patient care.  With well over 1 million cloud connected medical devices sending data every morning to the cloud, we are the world's leading tech driven medical device company. With the addition of the Brightree suite of software solutions we're building an end-to-end solutions offering that provides value for HME, physicians, payers, and for patients. With our channel partners we are improving operational efficiency, eliminating waste, increasing medical device adherence, and improving patient outcomes. We intend to grow our connected care solutions into COPD, as well as other chronic care applications as we continue to execute on our ResMed 2020 strategy. Our second foundation is our investment and expansion in high-growth geographies. Our investment in China with Curative is an example of this strategy in action.  Curative is strategically aligned and integrating well with our ResMed China business. Curative has very high quality products that are developed in China, made in China, and sold in China. Curative opens up channels that just aren\u2019t available for foreign made products. We are now leveraging the distribution capabilities of both organizations. We will continue to invest and expand our presence in China and other global high-growth markets including Southeast Asia, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe.  In each geography, the value we deliver is to improve patient quality of life, to improve objective patient outcomes and to reduce national healthcare costs in key chronic diseases. Our third foundation is operating excellence with a focus on developing the best-in-class talent and leveraging our market-leading style. We hire and develop the best talent in the industry. The leadership team that Rob and I have assembled is a key part of our competitive advantage in the marketplace. On the operational front, we continue to create efficiencies that allow us to free up cash to reinvest in key innovative R&D programs and also to better unlock value from our acquisitions. We are committed to continue growing operating profit ensuring that we have headroom to reinvest in the business and continue to drive profitable growth. These strong foundations are critical to allow us to achieve our ResMed 2020 growth goals. Before handing over to Brett, I would like to take a few minutes to update you on some key milestones of progress against our three horizons growth strategy.  In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we have seen strong sustained growth these last seven quarters. 18 months after the launch of the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10, and our Air Solutions platform's, we have truly changed the basis of competition in our core market from smaller quieter and more comfortable devices to smaller, quieter, more comfortable devices, but also more connected solutions.  While many companies are talking about connected care and talking about digital health, we have executed in connected care and we lead the market with well over 1 million 100% cloud connected medical devices sending data to the cloud every morning. We are liberating data that we turn into actionable information for patients, for physicians, for providers and even for payers. With the cloud-based software solution we\u2019re able to add enhancements every couple of weeks, every couple of months, to improve the efficiency of our customers and provide benefits to the whole value chain and especially patients. We continue to integrate to EMR and each EHR systems through the ResMed data exchange. And we recently added functionality within AirView, U-Sleep, and our newest ResMed mask text coaching program that provides daily coaching texts for patients, especially those who are brand new to therapy. With the Brightree acquisition we have augmented the Air Solutions platform with an even stronger end-to-end value proposition for our customers. On the market access front, there was a study published on the results of the first large-scale employer program to screen, diagnose, and monitor OSA treatment adherence in the U. S. trucking industry. The study concluded that drivers who were diagnosed and were adherent to our OSA therapy had reduced accident risks, similar to the control group.  However, drivers who had not adhered to OSA therapy had a five-fold, that is a five-fold greater preventable crash risk. There is clearly a long road to fully develop regulations in this transportation sector and we\u2019ve been working on this for a number of years, however, this type of clinical evidence of the risks to human life and major costs for the transportation sector are very important steps in the progress. In addition, this quarter the largest study in the history of sleep apnea was published by the European respiratory society. The study looked at the effect of gender and age on the co-morbidity burden of obstructive sleep apnea across a group of 1.7 million patients. The study concluded that type II diabetes, stroke, hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and depression were all more prevalent in patients with OSA when compared to the control group, regardless of gender. Bottom line, these data reiterate that sleep apnea remains a huge public health problem and that women are significantly at risk, not just the stereo typical men. And a key milestone of progress against the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy we closed the acquisition of Inova Labs early in the quarter. With this acquisition we have expanded our COPD offering to include portable oxygen concentrators or POC\u2019s. POC\u2019s enable patient mobility. This fits very well with the key value proposition of our life support ventilation platform Astral. They both give increased mobility and freedom back to the COPD patient.  We have started the integration progress at Inova and we are excited to add these products into our respiratory care portfolio. We have opportunities to grow revenue by filling POC's through our global market channels. We will prioritize the 100 countries that we sell into to maximize physician provider and patient value. We will also be able to bring our global operational and technological capability to create true economies of scale in supply chain management, manufacturing, and in logistics.  We will create mix generation Inova products that not only take quality to the next level for the platform, but that also leverage our health care informatics leadership. The strategy is to create connected care solutions for COPD with POC's, life support ventilation, and noninvasive ventilation. Given that we have already created connected care solutions for sleep apnea, we know we can execute to this plan. Midway through the quarter a study was published on overlap syndrome, which as a reminder is a cohort of patients who suffer from both sleep apnea and COPD. The study showed that early diagnosis and adherent treatment of sleep apnea in patients admitted with acute COPD exacerbation both reduces hospital readmissions and reduces emergency room visits over a period of six months.  The study also projected that these benefits would persist over 12 months. This is great news for patients, hospitals, physicians, and payers. Under the new reimbursement models everyone in the value chain, including hospitals wants to keep COPD patients out of hospitals and in their home and happy. Our ResMed products and solutions will be a key part of this. Our third horizon of growth includes a robust portfolio of opportunities in new markets, including a trial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, and also sleep health and wellness. We expect to have some exciting clinical data on our third horizon of growth next quarter. I do not want to steal the thunder from the researchers, so for now I\u2019ll just say watch this space. Returning back to our financial results for the quarter, we\u2019ve been able to put our balance sheet to work with the completion of the Inova Labs acquisition and just a few weeks ago, the Brightree acquisition. We have continued our dividend program and for now we have held back our share repurchase program. We believe this approach is prudent given that we have taken on an additional $725 million worth of debt to fund our acquisition of Brightree. It is important to note that we may resume the share buyback program without prior notice in the near future as conditions warrant. Let me close with this, we're the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but more importantly with game changing innovation in both products and solutions for the future of connected care. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly the patients around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for more a detailed review of our Q3 financials. Brett? Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the March quarter was $453.9 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 9%. Movements in exchange rates, predominately a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue by approximately $6.3 million in the third quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $282.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific totaled $171.7 million, consistent with the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in combined EME and Asia Pacific increased by 3% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $153.2 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $129 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our Inova sales are included with flow generators under the advised revenue category. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific device sales were $116.7 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year and in constant currency terms an increase of 3%. Masks and other sales were $55 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 3%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 10% while masks and other increased by 7% over the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we incurred acquisition related expenses of $3.6 million associated with the Inova Labs and Brightree acquisitions. During the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of the acquisition related expenses as well as the amortization acquired in intangibles both in the current year and last year. We reconciled the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter press release. Gross margin for the March quarter was 57.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 220 basis points reflecting the impact of changes in product mix, declines in average selling prices and changes in geographic mix partially offset by favorable net currency movements. We estimate the recent Brightree acquisition will have a positive impact of 70 basis points to 100 basis points on our gross margin and with this impact combined with current exchange rates, unlikely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin to continue to be in the range of 57% to 60% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $119.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 26.3% compared to the year ago figure of 27.5%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.1 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and on a constant currency basis, an increase of 11%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.2% compared to the year ago figure of 6.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $4.6 million for the quarter. The increase over the prior year amortization expense of $2.2 million reflects the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.9 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5% compared to 20.5% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 will be in the vicinity of 20%. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $112.4 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $95.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $88.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.68, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.63. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $0.04 per share reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar partially offset by the weaker euro. Cash flow from operations was $122.1 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13.2 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $19.9 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares during the March quarter, however we may at any time elect to reinitiate the share repurchase program. At the end of March, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Inova Labs effective January 29. The acquisition was funded by drilling on our existing credit facility. Additionally, this month, we announced the close of the Brightree acquisition effective April 04. Brightree will be included in our consolidated results in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The $800 million acquisition was funded by utilizing $75 million in existing cash, relishing a $300 million term line and drilling down funds from our revolving credit facility. Note we have also increased our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $1 billion. At the close of the Brightree acquisition, we have approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $500 million in net debt. Post acquisition, our balance sheet remains modestly great and very strong. Total assets are approximately $3.3 billion and net equity is approximately $1.7 billion.  And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have any additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Andrew, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs is online with a question. Ian Abbott : Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the gross margin, it certainly stepped down again this quarter, you did call out the impact of ASV. I am just wondering why that was particularly an impact this quarter given it would also have been an impact in the prior two quarters. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Ian. There is a number of factors as you know that go into gross margin. One of the impacts is that the ASV as you talked about. If you remember 12 months ago in March 2015, there was the American College of Cardiology and there was a lot of very positive press around heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and ASV, and we really saw those very high margin ASV products this time a year ago do incredibly well in the March quarter, and so we are annualizing if you like a steeper curve on ASV from a year ago and that headwind. And as I say the endpoint of that is the announcement is May 13, 2016 when we annualize that, so there will be six weeks in Q4 with that steep curve as well. That is one factor. Another factor impacting gross margin was the outperformance of our Americas team, which is lower than group margin but still very positive gross profit dollars but lower than group margin and the other impact was the outperformance of our flow generator line. So the AirSense 10, and the AirCurve 10, which were lower than group margins but very positive products as a platform together in flow generators and those were outperforming the market and outperforming the rest of the business and so had an impact on GM. Ian Abbott : Okay. And then as a follow-up, you also talk about average selling prices and that\u2019s always a feature of the industry but if you could perhaps comment just on what you are seeing there both in the U.S. and also rest of the world. Mick Farrell : Yes, look, the pricing environment is pretty normal. As you know, Ian, about two years ago we stopped giving the quarterly update on year-on-year ASP adjustments, but it's really back to a pretty normal level. 18 or 20 months ago there was a bit of a step change but we are back to a pretty normal level on pricing. Another factor on GM that I didn't talk about was the acquisition of Inova which again a great product portable oxygen concentrators but closer to flow generator profit margin. And so there was two months of the three months of the quarter that we had sold Inova which had an impact on GM as well, but average prices are in a pretty stable environment both in the U.S. and in Europe. Ian Abbott : Great. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Ian. Operator : Matt Taylor from Barclays is on the line with a question. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us understand the total impact of the various acquisitions in the quarter and any help with which pieces are going where; I\u2019m trying to determine what they contributed versus what you are doing with the AirSense platform. Mick Farrell : Yes, that is a good question, Matt. Thanks. That will allow us to talk to organic growth and some of the acquisition growth. So as I mentioned just earlier, we had two months of Inova included in the quarter. We also had a full quarter of Curative, our acquisition in China. So when you combine the two months of Inova and the three months of Curative, it probably together contributed around 2% to global growth, so our 9% constant currency global growth was 7% organic and 2% acquisition driven. Those are broad estimates. Brett, do you want to provide any further color on that? Is that approximately right? Brett Sandercock : That\u2019s spot on, Mick. It contributed around 2% to revenue growth this quarter. Matt Taylor : How intuitive is in both categories outside the U.S. and Inova is just [indiscernible]? Mick Farrell : Brett? Brett Sandercock : Yes, yes. Okay, thanks a lot, very helpful. Mick Farrell : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Andrew Goodsall from UBS is on the line with a question. Andrew Goodsall : Sure, thanks very much. Could I just borrow down a little bit more there and sort of understand if we look at the U.S. flow generator growth with device growth 15%, just within that number what was organically acquired with the Inova? Mick Farrell : Yeah, thanks for the question Andrew. We really don\u2019t want to sort of because we do give that sort of matrix of detail now within Americas and EMEA and APAC within flow gens and masks. We don\u2019t want to break out the organic versus acquisition debt all the way down the matrix. I can tell you at a high level that the core growth, if we say the market is growing at mid-to high single digits in the sleep apnea markets if you like, we well outperformed that but I don't want to break the 15 out down by basis points because I think that starts to get us into a level of granularity that we just do not get from our competitors on public conference calls and it doesn\u2019t really help our shareholders and driving long-term value but I appreciate the question. Andrew Goodsall : Okay. So if market is 6% to 8%, you are tracking above that level on your flow gens? Mick Farrell : Yes, we are significantly above that. Andrew Goodsall : Great, that's perfect. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is on the line with a question. Margaret Kaczor : Good afternoon, everyone. Good morning, Brett. The first question maybe is on the U. S. side, obviously, we've seen some good durables strength you just talked about it, but you guys are facing a tougher comp as we go into the next few quarters. So, do you envision being able to keep up that double-digit range and just talk about the overall durability of the business. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yeah, good question Margaret. Look, we do want to go into too much. We don\u2019t give guidance. We don't want to go into too much detail. But look at a very high level, we think the Air Solutions Platform and what it has created \u2013 the ecosystem it has created is provided such value for our customers and not just the HME customers, but also for patients. We have 900 patients every day signing up to a patient application called myAir. So the value for the ecosystem is just so strong that we see that demand continuing. But we are realistic; we know that there are some big comps particularly on flow generators and particularly in the Americas for Q4 and Q1, but we have a very strong value proposition on that. Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas, do want to give any further color on that? Jim Hollingshead : Sure. Thanks for the question, Margaret. We are seeing very robust growth in the flow gen platforms because of the solutions adoption. The AirSense and AirCurve 10 platforms are both superior products to anything on the market just as a flow generator to begin with, but we are seeing a lot of uptake of our solutions across many, many of our customers and we think that\u2019s driving the persistent growth. We feel very confident in that. Margaret Kaczor : Okay, great. And then just to keep pushing on that a little bit, how is the sales process may be changed with your acquisition of Brightree, I know it\u2019s kind of early days, but are you seeing your sales guys go into these accounts and sell Brightree, Inova and sleep apnea [ph] in one transaction and how should we expect that go-to-market strategy to change in year one, two and so on? Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yeah, thanks, Margaret. Well, there is a lot of aspects to that question. I will let Jim provide a little more color if it makes sense on the go-to-market, but at a high level what we are doing with the Inova acquisition, which we had two months as said of close of that in the quarter is we are working very carefully with our territory managers and our region managers and some specialists from the Inova team on portable oxygen concentrators. In a similar way that we have specialist on ventilation and other respiratory care products, we will have specialist sales force on portable oxygen concentrators. But the full portfolio is available to our whole sales team. And so what we really like to provide is a portfolio of solutions to our customers. There are different selling methodologies and selling cloud-based software that requires an infrastructure investment upfront and signing long-term contract such as Brightree interaction versus providing, say, faster turnaround items such as patient interface systems and masks. However, we have a good portfolio of people in our sales force that can do both the transactional and the long-term strategic sales as part of that. Jim, do you want to provide any further color on the go-to-market for the Brightree and Inova? Jim Hollingshead : I will comment, may not be further color, I will just say it\u2019s work in progress. We\u2019re a little bit further along with the planning for Inova Labs and how we integrate that. Brightree will continue to be a separate subsidiary, but you can imagine we really just closed both of those acquisitions, so we are working on that plan right now, Margaret. Margaret Kaczor : Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Margaret. Operator : Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question. Will Dunlop : Thanks. Good morning. You\u2019ve given the contribution of acquisition to sales; are you able to give the contribution to profits or EBIT? Brett Sandercock : Thanks for the question. We really don\u2019t want to drill down through the whole P&L. With regard to that, we will have an SEC document that we will provide before the end of the fiscal year. So this quarter that will outline the Brightree business in quite some detail, so you will see that in the coming months. But we really don\u2019t want to sort of get into a quarterly reporting where we break down all the way through the P&L for these three acquisitions, but we are happy to provide that color at the top line that it is around 2% of global growth, so 9% total growth, 7% organic and 2% acquisition driven. Will Dunlop : Okay, thank you. And are you just able to give some color around what your U. S. customers are asking for in terms of price given that we are heading into the implementation of round two [indiscernible] and full round three price reduction as of July 1? Mick Farrell : Yeah, I will hand to Jim Hollingshead; he is closest to the U. S. business line. Jim Hollingshead : Yeah, we\u2019ve been having those conversations for months with customers. I think that this year is a little bit different from FY2014 when CB2 hit for the first time. So the vast majority of our customers have anticipated what\u2019s coming and we\u2019ve been having pricing conversations with them for months. And so, this does hit their business and we are continuing to have the normal pricing conversations in that context. Will Dunlop : Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Will. Operator : Mike Matson from Needham & Company is online with a question. Mike Matson : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to ask about Brightree. I know there has been concern amongst the HME customer base around the data that you guys have access to through their cloud-based system, so I was just wondering, one, do you think that\u2019s a risk, that they only need some of those customers and then they might choose to move to a different software provider? And two, is there a way that you can try to wall off that data and convince them that you are not going to use that to try to help your flow generator and masks sales? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Mike. The Brightree acquisition is really \u2013 when you think about it, it\u2019s a huge investment that ResMed made, around 10% of our market cap we invested, $800 million in our HME customers in software that is purely focused on having cloud-based software applications that take laborious tasks like revenue cycle management, like inventory management, like clinical protocol management and physician signature management and automate those. And so, we think that instead of being owned by a venture capital firm being owned by a player who has a long-term 27-year history in its industry and plan to invest for the next 27 years in providing home medical equipment, but it's a really positive sign for our customers that it\u2019s got strong financial backing and someone who really cares about it. We are excited about the hospice and we're excited about home health because those are the new channels that the Brightree acquisition brings. Have a lot of sleep disorder breathing and a lot of COPD and neuromuscular disease patients, so that we can roll back in to our HME customers. But look I got to tell you, I haven\u2019t had as many conversations with Jim, but I have out of these last 2.5 plus months since we announced this acquisition been in a number of dinners and conversations with customers where I express what our goals are and what our plans are with Brightree and how we are going to invest to not only improve good quality to great quality, but ensure that we have even more efficiencies for them as a whole channel and our investment is to make sure more and more sleep apnea patients are able to be served by them has been received very positively. But, Jim, do want to talk a little bit more to the specifics of Mike\u2019s question? Jim Hollingshead : Yeah, sure, it's a great question and we have had that question from customers, right. And I will say as a blanket statement to start, we are absolutely committed to putting in place appropriate protection for our customers\u2019 business sensitive information. It\u2019s very important to us that we do that, that\u2019s how we work with our customers in general and that\u2019s how we are as a company and so we are completely committed to that. But if I go broader and just say about the reaction of customers in the market, it has been more than two months since we announced that acquisition. And generally speaking, I think that the response from our customers has been very positive. And I think you can see in the Q3 results that if anything it\u2019s impacted the business positively. Mike Matson : All right. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the international business, at 3% growth, I mean what do you think those markets are growing at, do you think you are gaining or losing share in those markets? And just comment on the air solutions, it\u2019s doing really well in the U.S., but do you think it is as appealing to those international customers? Mick Farrell : Yeah, good question, Mark. I will hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Rob Douglas : Yeah, thanks, Mike. In all of our other countries around the world, we view them as a portfolio; they are all running on different dynamics. And some are growing strongly at various times and other ones have challenging periods. Across the board, we are seeing \u2013 we talk about the mid-single market growth, mid-single digits market growth, and we believe that we are very much holding our own in that market growth and going well. The air solutions dynamic is quite different in different countries and every country has own major drivers. Some things are always the same, patients are always interested in their information and anything we can provide to them that helps them use the equipment and stay on using equipment that improves their outcome is useful. And we are seeing that in all of those markets. In other markets, we have to deal with specific issues, specific privacy concerns in Europe, language concerns in Japan, for example, and all of those things we\u2019ve got going well and we are on, I guess, it\u2019s slower than the U.S. but a very solid implementation plan through all of those countries to roll air solutions out. It\u2019s an ongoing program for us. Mike Matson : All right, thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Mick. Operator : Matth O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray is on the line with question. J.P. Peltier: This is actually J.P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess in terms of going back to the revenue break down between flow generator and masks, I mean you\u2019ve been able to grow flow generators faster than masks for the past few quarters and arguably tougher comps, so I\u2019m just trying to drill in on the mask side of the business, is there anything going on from a competitive dynamic or from a pricing headwind perspective that is making performance there challenging? Mick Farrell : Look, don't judge the outperformance of our flow generators to make our masks look bad. I mean the Americas flow generator performance at 16% year-on-year provided on a constant currency basis was just incredible and driven by, as Rob said, a very fast take up a air solutions in these last 18 months, it\u2019s a longer haul for some of those other 99 countries we do business in. The 10% year-on-year constant currency growth in masks and accessories I think is exceptional. And certainly keeping share and probably taking share in some categories. Look, having said that, we are in a competitive game and the competitive game is across the board. We changed the basis of competition in flow generators, which has allowed us to outperform in that category. Will we and can we continue to change the game and bring increasing and great innovation to our mask platform? Well, we\u2019ve been doing it for 27 years and we plan to do it for the next 27 years. So the answer to that is yes. We put 7% of our revenues approximately into research and development, a very good chunk of that goes into mask innovation, plastic science, anthropometric, understanding what patients need now and in the future. And I got to tell you I am really excited about the pipeline of masks and I think that the team did well in that in Q3, but we can always do better. Sure just a follow-up, on the competitive that you alluded to what is in the feedback the year-over-year sales reps effort on this treat from the Phillips launch? J.P. Peltier: Sure. And just a follow-up on the competitive dynamics you alluded to. What is in the feedback that you\u2019ve heard or your sales have heard on the street from Philips-Medtronic generator launch? Mick Farrell : You know, look, I really don't like to sort of throw a model, get involved in sort of a competitor back and forth on these conference call J.P. All I will say is that look our device, and it\u2019s really our solution, the air solutions platform has incredible advantages. We take great cost out of the system, we provide such value for our customers and customers are using a broad sense. The customer is the patient obviously but it\u2019s also the provider, the DME, it is also payers and other folks beyond. And the value we are able to do by linking up with EMR and EHR systems in a closed payer-provider network or a government run insurance in Western Europe network or \u2013 and the data we\u2019re able to provide, patients means the strong demand for our product. And so I do think we\u2019ve got a winning value proposition. I think it\u2019s a very sustainable competitive advantage. But having said that, we believe in productive paranoia. And as I was saying earlier, we innovate our cloud-based systems on a regular basis. Weekly and monthly upgraded to these to make sure we keep those is a finely oiled machine here and that\u2019s our goal in this space. But look there is always competition. We love competition. What we love doing is really providing value to customers and customers choosing our products and solutions because of that. J.P. Peltier: Great, thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, J.P. Operator : Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question. Saul Hadassin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mick, maybe a question for you. I think in the past you\u2019ve talked to a mask lifecycle of around 1.5, maybe 2 years, I just want to check if that\u2019s still correct, because you are up the T\u2019s I think since the range of the masks were launched. And I'm just wondering where we are in terms of that launch cycle, how should we be expecting some new masks anytime soon? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Saul. Yeah, well, I mean, I was talking about the healthcare informatics lifecycle of being every couple of months with an upgrade. Mask systems \u2013 it depends on the full face, the nasal, the pillows and the technologies you are using. The AirFit range has been incredibly successful. The P10 mask, which is a nasal pillows mask, which I personally use, is the best mask on the planet for nasal pillows and our F10 remains clearly a world leading mask. And the N10, I think it's a very good mask, I think look we can always do better. And every time we release a product we are looking to do better. You know, Saul, that we don\u2019t go into the specifics of our roadmap, but if you are asking me are there are exciting masks in the horizon? Of course, there are. How far is that horizon now? Well, I can\u2019t go into details on that. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to from a competitive dynamic front given the public nature of this call. Saul Hadassin : Fair enough. And just to sneak one more in for Brett, just regarding operating cash flow, another quarter of very strong right there, I think, for the nine months it\u2019s up almost 40% with essentially flat non-GAAP earnings, just wondering what you\u2019ve changed there in terms of that working capital management that has benefited that line? Brett Sandercock : Yeah. Thanks, Saul. The cash flow has been very strong for the business and has been quite sustained over the three quarters as you noted. So we're really pleased with that. If you look at the big one there is probably around inventory where we\u2019ve managed to reduce that over time. There's a lot with the essence growth thing, so strong over the period. I think now we\u2019ve had time to stabilize that and adjust somewhat. So we really started tune inventory levels and I think that sort of \u2013 its underlying \u2013 the strong underlying earnings has played a part for sure and then really turning that inventory, I think, it\u2019s just sort of underpin and deliver some stronger cash flow through those quarters. That's probably bring the biggest impact. Saul Hadassin : Thanks guys. Operator : Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on the line with a question. Anthony Petrone : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one question on Brightree and I think you touched on it earlier. So forgive me if I'm overlapping me here a bit, but maybe just to expand a little bit on the strategy there, how long do you think it will take to fully integrate Brightree and sort of what synergies do you expect particularly in the HME, DME channel in the U. S. in terms of just install base on the Brightree side? Is there an opportunity to sort of up sell Brightree solutions into the existing ResMed install base? Mick Farrell : Well, thanks for the question, Anthony. Clearly the revenue and EBITDA is an immediate integration right. So, we get a nice addition of $113 million growing at strong levels on the top line and north of $43 million of EBITDA growing strong double-digits as well, so that was integrated immediately. In terms of the operating integration, as Jim said earlier, we will run Brightree as a subsidiary that has clearly separation of some data to make sure that our teams perform everything appropriately. The synergies with customers are that clearly we have customers who purchase our products and will also purchase Brightree solutions. So there will be a clear coordination between our sales force, but as Jim said, we closed the acquisition on April 4, and it is now April 26, we haven\u2019t fully integrated our go-to-market in the first 22 days, but we do have a 91-83-60 [ph] plan here and will be able to provide, probably on this call over the coming fourth quarters, further and further integrations including obviously financial integration starting Q4 those numbers rolling in, but then the go-to-market integration over the coming four quarters. Anthony Petrone : And then, just one follow-up there and hop back in, but just \u2013 again should we assume that this is traditional software margin structure, where it should be margin accretive overall to the business or will that take some time to sort of play out? Mick Farrell : Yeah, Anthony. It will be immediately gross margin accretive and I think Brett in his prepared remarks talked about 70 to 100 basis points of positive contribution is likely in Q4 from including of the Brightree \u2013 the Brightree financials. So, it is a really good immediately accretive on top line and on GM. Anthony Petrone : Got it. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Anthony. Operator : Victor Windeyer from Citi is on the line with a question. Victor Windeyer : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Look, I just wanted to try it out a bit, trying to get the underlying plain growth. So you mentioned [indiscernible] I think back in the day when the trial [indiscernible] result came out, you\u2019ve had $150 million of [indiscernible] and I just want to know if you could give us any clarity on what the quarter will be year-on-year? [Indiscernible] whether it\u2019s flat sequentially now? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Victor. I\u2019ll hand it to Rob to address the European and ASV question. Rob Douglas : Yeah, thanks, Victor. When we made the announcement last year, we sort of gave some indications of what we felt the impact would be. We are pretty accurate in those predictions and so we roughly standby those predictions. The impact has been more significant in Europe where we had an indication for cardiology patients versus in the U.S. where we didn\u2019t. Our team working hard on some of the other applications for ASV and Mick mentioned them earlier on. Particularly talking about on complex sleep apnea as well as on patients who are on pain medication and so we see a lot of opportunities there and those market development opportunities are underway not only emphasize in the U.S., but also in other markets around the world. And we should start to see some benefit from those activities selling through. And as Nick also said earlier, we will anniversary the announcement on May 13 and the impact that we \u2013 the short-term impact that we had after that came on fairly quickly. So we should see those activities even up from there on in. Victor Windeyer : Okay. So, after you give the timing, you said 25% [indiscernible] maybe that\u2019s clearly the $40 million or something, $10 million a quarter, I mean is that roughly where it comes in, is that what you --? Mick Farrell : Victor, we\u2019re not going to go into the details. You\u2019re right. That\u2019s what we side. At that time, we said it\u2019s \u2013 ASV is roughly 7% of the revenues and we thought a quarter of that might be at risk and roughly on the global numbers that\u2019s roughly in line. As Rob said, it was a bit ahead of that in Europe and Americas was not as badly affected as Europe. Rob Douglas : Thanks for your question, Victor. Victor Windeyer : [Indiscernible] level we expected to grow with the applications, we are going expect that one to grow in the underlying business to come forward [indiscernible]. Mick Farrell : Yeah, yeah, Victor, as I said earlier and Rob just said now, from May 13, we will hit the anniversary of the date of the announcement and from then the activity went pretty quickly as Rob said. So we should expect to ramp to strong positive ASV growth from that date. But really as I said in my prepared remarks, fiscal 2017 is where we are going to see the benefits of complex sleep apnea, payments medication, post traumatic stress disorder and also some other applications on CSA that are interesting in the sort of stroke patients and others. So, we\u2019ll see those going forward. Victor Windeyer : Okay. Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Victor. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Chris Kallos from Morningstar is on the line with the question. Chris Kallos : Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one on the gross margin side, the guidance of 57%, 60% does that include the margin equation from Brightree? Mick Farrell : Brett? Brett Sandercock : Yeah, Chris. Hi, it\u2019s Brett. Yes, it does. Chris Kallos : Okay. So does that suggest that without Brightree the gross margin would be sort of on the low side? So the guidance would actually be lower? Brett Sandercock : I am not sure you can conclude that Chris. At the end of the day, we sort of 57% to 60% obviously Brightree will have a quite significant positive impact for us going into Q4 and then all the other factors play out as well that\u2019s come up with that guidance range. I don't think you can form a conclusion either way on what the guidance would have been in, but certainly Brightree will have a positive impact on that. Chris Kallos : Great. And just a quick follow-up, on the reimbursements, you mentioned on the rebid, are there any other comments you could add to that on just reimbursement right now? Brett Sandercock : No. there is nothing new in the reimbursement environment globally. So, I mean frankly everything that\u2019s been talked about in the U. S. has been projected, the government run process, so it is usually projected 12, 24, even 36 months in advance. So, there is really now news on the reimbursement plan. Chris Kallos : Great. Thank you. Brett Sandercock : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question. Margaret Kaczor : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking a follow-up. Maybe the first question, just a follow-up on, we know that the ASV is obviously had an impact on the international dynamics, but do you guys have a same store growth number if you do take ASVs out of international? Brett Sandercock : Yeah. Margaret. Good follow-up, but we do not want to provide that level of detail. Rob if you can provide any color to help address Margaret's question that we want to share. Rob Douglas : No, we really do not want to break that out Margaret, but obviously with the ASV not helping some of the other underlying parts of the business, it would look better, if the ISC wasn\u2019t included in it, but it\u2019s just too commercially sensitive to break all that out. Brett Sandercock : I mean the one bit of color we can provide is that ASV, and this is important as it starts to come back in 2017. It\u2019s a very margin accretive product. It's a very margin accretive product. So, as it starts to come back it will really benefit us and clearly, just hitting the 12 month mark of a headwind that\u2019s been a tough 11 months on the GM front as you guys have seen in the numbers with that as a headwind as it starts to turn mutual and become a tailwind in 2017. It can really help us, but clearly we are executing on ASV we got some really exciting applications for it, you will hear more from us on this front in the future. Margaret Kaczor : Great. And then, just in terms of gross margin again, Brett maybe you can give us a little bit more perspective, you mentioned mix ASP and geographic mix, should we think of that about that third or third or third or overweight one of those categories and as ASV comes back, is that the primary driver to maybe reverse that trend on gross margins for the course sleep apnea business and over what timeframe should we expect that? Thank you. Rob Douglas : So that seven part multi-question, it\u2019s a perfect one for Brett. Brett Sandercock : I\u2019ll have a crack of that one. Thanks, Margaret. Look, the most significant one has definitely been product mix and that\u2019s been the biggest one and that\u2019s multiple really, obviously ASV is playing out there a little bit and playing out there as well and just a really strong outperformance in flow generators. So, it\u2019s a big thing of those - with ASV that sort of stuff dissipates certainly through Q4 and then into Q1. So that will certainly help. And then, obviously Brightree comes on boarding in Q4 as well. And then just as I mentioned earlier just depends on the trends for products mix and also geographic mix. So, even really strong outperformance in the Americas, which is positive, does have an impact on the growth margin. So, a number of factors playing out, but some of those moderate and some of kind of disappeared into FY17. So, I think that\u2019s good. I mean the important thing on that European and ASV headwind, is that that\u2019s go away and that\u2019s if you strip that out, the device number internationally would be better. So, I think that\u2019s something to look at that, I think that obviously headwind is really detracting from international and that is definitely something it\u2019s going to go away into FY17. Margaret Kaczor : Thank you, guys very helpful. Brett Sandercock : Yeah. Thanks, Margaret. Operator : Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is on the line with a question. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon everyone, Mick one question for you and one for Brett. Mick you give a pretty good insight into how you are going to be integrating Brightree and you're going to be helping your customers, I guess let me just belabor that point, specifically Phillips and the [well-wisher] customers. So what is the stickiness if I can use that word, for Phillips and developers staying with Brightree? In other words, do you all risk losing Phillips and Devilbiss some point in the future, how do all prevent that because that would be some portion of Brightree's revenues? Mick Farrell : The revenues for Brightree come from the customers who are the HME providers and HME providers have a portfolio of products that they use. So they - our customers or the HME providers are buying from ResMed and some of the competitors that you named. So my presumption is our customers will continue to want to buy from them and would want them to use the software program that our customers are using. It is as simple as that. It is not our decision or our competitors decision it\u2019s the customers decision and the customer has to make a right decision and about the economic interests, the longer-term interest primarily with their patients and for growing business efficiently. So, we think that will play out, really we've had two or three months of this out there and playing out just fine as far as we see it. So, we're pretty excited frankly two months after the announcement and really only 22 days after the close and we're revving up to move forward. Suraj Kalia : Fair enough. And Brett I know you mentioned 7% organic growth and 2% acquired on a constant currency basis and maybe I missed this, Brett since curative is primarily [U. S.] , Inova is primarily U. S. can you give us the as reported numbers for the quarter? Thank you for taking my questions. Brett Sandercock : Yeah. I think Mick talked about it earlier in terms of getting going too much into the detail on that. I think you guys - the overall number was 2% and either would be squid to devices obviously and then more spread. So, I think probably did not have some fair estimates on what kind of the impacts would be through the categories without going into too much detail on it. Operator : We are now at the one hour Mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thank you, Andrew. And in closing, I want to welcome the Inova and Brightree teams to our global ResMed team and to thank the now almost 5000 strong team here at ResMed from around the world for their commitment to changing lives, of millions of patients with every breath. I'm very proud of what this team has accomplished not just here in Q3, but beyond in creating the world\u2019s leading tech driven medical device company. We remain laser focused our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020 by literally giving products and the gift of breath to those folks. Thanks for your time and we will talk to again in 90 days. Agnes Lee : Thank you again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website in about two hours at investors.resmed.com. Andrew you may now close the call. Operator : This concludes ResMed\u2019s third quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings live webcast. You may disconnect.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Laurel and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Laurel and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we summarize our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. We delivered solid global growth this quarter led by strong double-digit growth in the Americas region and high single-digit growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions. We closed the Brightree acquisition April 4. So, this is our first quarter that includes revenue and profit contribution from the Brightree suite of software-as-a-service offerings. For the call today, I will first review our high level financial results, I will then outline some regional highlights from our business, and then finally, I will discuss progress towards our ResMed 2020 strategic goals. After that, I will hand the call over to Brett to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. Throughout fiscal year 2016, I have talked about ResMed\u2019s growing global leadership in digital health and connected care for respiratory medicine. This leadership has been a catalyst for strong overall revenue growth and market beating organic revenue growth these last 12 months. We produced robust double-digit growth in the Americas region. These results were fueled by the ongoing success of organic masks and devices growth augmented by new software-as-a-service revenue from Brightree. We achieved above market growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions with the highlight being double-digit growth of our flow generators in the combined EMEA and APAC group. At the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share, was $0.74 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 9% year-on-year growth. In terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew our bottom line at 20% in Q4 on a year-on-year basis. We continue to balance strong revenue growth with ongoing investments in R&D and our global focus on operating excellence. We achieved positive operating leverage in SG&A, keeping its growth well below our top line revenue growth. We are investing for the long-term future, maintaining R&D spend at around 7% of top line revenue. These R&D investments will enhance our long-term pipeline of innovation across the portfolios of sleep apnea, COPD and connected care solutions. Now, let me drill into some regional highlights. First, in the Americas region, we had strong sales performance in Q4 with our commercial team driving 11% growth in masks and accessories and 6% growth in devices in the Americas. This latter number was up against a hefty 53% growth comparable from last year. These robust results from the Americas team have the foundation of stable market growth. However, it really shows the ongoing strength of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 systems, powered and catalyzed by our cloud-based Air Solutions software platform, including the U-Sleep and myAir applications. These applications are liberating data and unlocking value in terms of actionable information for HME providers and for patients, respectively. The double-digit growth for the masks and accessories category was a great result for the Americas in Q4. We expect solid masks and accessories growth as we move forward with resupply initiatives and new product launches during fiscal year 2017. Turning to the combined EMEA and APAC group. We had strong sales performance in these regions, resulting in 8% growth on a constant currency basis in Q4. We produced solid growth in devices in the region, especially from our sleep apnea platforms. As we discussed last quarter, the ASV growth headwind started to subside mid-Q4, and we will pass the anniversary of the tail of this impact in this current quarter, Q1 fiscal \u201817. We are clearly turning the corner in ASV, and we continue to see exciting opportunities ahead for ASV therapy, particularly for patients with central sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea, pain management medication and posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. We are excited to get back to growth on a trajectory for this really innovative, beneficial and high-margin therapy. Let me now provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. We have made good progress in global leadership for connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have now incorporated into our P&L high-quality, recurring software-as-a-service revenue from Brightree. We will continue to invest in our portfolio of cloud-based computing solutions to help our HME customers become even more efficient and to help them free up cash flow for even better patient care. We recently announced a new CEO and a new COO for Brightree. Matt Mellott is the new CEO and Bobby Ghoshal is the new COO. Matt\u2019s experience in successfully building and running a multi-state HME that used Brightree as an integral part of that business sets him up as a strong and capable leader for Brightree. Bobby\u2019s experience in running ResMed\u2019s IT team for the Americas sets him up to be a great operating partner together with Matt. So Matt and Bobby, together with the Brightree leadership team, will guide the development and ongoing integration of the Brightree suite of software solutions within and as a part of the Air Solutions platform offerings. The goal is clear to provide enhanced value for HME partners, for physicians, for payers and for patients. With our HME channel partners, our current connected care solutions are improving operating efficiency. They are eliminating waste, increasing medical device adherence and improving patient outcomes. We intend to continue to grow our connected care solutions in COPD as well as other chronic care applications as we move forward. This strategic foundation of connected care is an integral part of our current and our future success. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of our Three Horizons and then hand over to Brett, and then we\u2019ll head on to Q&A. In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we have seen strong, sustained growth since the launch of the Air Solutions platform. While many companies are talking about connected care and digital health, we have executed in connected care, and we lead the market with well over 2 million, 100% cloud-connected medical devices, sending data to the cloud every day. This is more than double the nearest competitor. We also have over 900 patients each day signing up for our patient engagement application called myAir. Air Solutions not only has millions and millions of patients, it is also connected through APIs to hospital and physician managed electronic medical record systems that allow patients to share data with their caregivers. We are in mile 1 of a marathon of population health management and health care analytics. Through this ecosystem, we are liberating data that we turn into actionable information for patients, physicians, providers and for payers. At ResMed, we are a company that is clearly founded on scientific principles of research. During the quarter, Dr. Dennis Hwang of Kaiser Permanente presented results from a large prospective randomized controlled trial at the SLEEP meeting in Denver, Colorado. The Kaiser Permanente study randomized 1,455 patients, and its conclusion was that the use of ResMed\u2019s cloud based algorithm called U-Sleep produced a 21% relative increase in sleep habit adherence. Dr. Hwang was quoted as saying the following : anything that significantly increases CPAP use in the first 90 days is a big deal. That initial period is crucial for patients to embrace CPAP to treat their sleep apnea, which is linked to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes and other serious conditions. Tools like U-Sleep hold a lot of promise for patients on CPAP and the clinicians who treat them. We think that\u2019s a great quote. We believe that U-Sleep and the broader Air Solutions platform is a huge value to Kaiser Permanente as well as other payer provider models in the U.S. and around the world, including ACOs, IDNs and many government run payer provider models as they look for ways to take better care of patients and essentially to keep their patients out of high cost hospitals and to treat them with high quality and great care in the concerns of their own home. With the close of the Brightree acquisition in Q4, we have augmented Air Solutions to create an even stronger end-to-end value proposition for HME customers. We will continue to help our HME partners drive even more efficiencies in their businesses and also continue to invest in market development of new channels for the software-as-a-service offerings of Brightree in home health, home nursing as well as in the hospice channel. Watch this space. In the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we have continued the integration process at Inova, which is the portable oxygen concentrator company we acquired in Q3. We have completed the integration of our commercial sales and marketing teams and we are now leveraging our global manufacturing, quality and product development expertise to take Inova to the next level. We clearly have opportunities to grow revenue by selling POCs through our global market channels and we will prioritize the 100 countries where we sell so as to maximize physician, provider and patient value throughout fiscal year 2017 and beyond. We will create next generation Inova products that provide not only a step up in quality, but also to leverage our global connected care leadership in this space. The strategy is to leverage connected care solutions for COPD across a broad portfolio of offerings, including life support ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, and now portable oxygen concentrators. This spectrum of respiratory care products will help patients with neuromuscular diseases like ALS as well as normocapnic COPD and hypercapnic COPD patients. With COPD being the number three cause of death in the Western world and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in the West, we know connected care will play a big role in the future. This quarter, we announced that we are adding a ResMed communication module, essentially a wireless communication module, to our life support ventilator, Astral. There will be more to come on this front. Along with our product strategies in this space, we are driving market channel strategies. In Q4, we announced a group purchasing organization, or GPO contract, to enable 3,600 member hospitals and 120,000 other providers to purchase and use ResMed\u2019s best-in-class respiratory care products and services as patients move from the hospital to in-home care. As I noted just a moment ago, there will be more to come on this front as we continue to execute against this part of our strategy. Our third horizon of growth, includes a robust portfolio of long-term opportunities in new markets, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, chronic disease management as well as sleep health and sleep wellness. During the quarter, clinical trial results from the CAT-HF trial were presented at the annual Heart Failure Congress at the European Society of Cardiology or ESC. The overall CAT-HF study results were neutral. However, a pre-specified subgroup of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients showed a clinically and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint for this study was a combined measure of mortality, morbidity and functional outcomes of the patient. This study, CAT-HF, is the first study globally to show that addressing sleep disordered breathing with Adaptive Servo-Ventilation may improve cardiovascular outcomes, heart outcomes for people with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. We expect full publication of the CAT-HF study shortly and we are very excited about the patient outcome data and the potential opportunities to save hospitalization and re-hospitalization costs for the healthcare system globally. Returning to our financial results, we have been able to put our balance sheet to work this fiscal year. We have invested $1 billion into high quality acquisitions that clearly drive us towards our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. You will see us laser focused on ensuring we get return on capital for these investments. Our Board has increased the dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in our long-term strategy and our ability to drive ongoing cash flow from the business. Given our significant capital deployment this year, we believe it is prudent to continue to temporarily suspend our share repurchase program. It is important to note that we reserve the right to resume the share buyback program at any time in the future as conditions warrant. Let me close with this. In fiscal year 2016, we established ourselves as the global leader in digital health and connected care for respiratory medicine. This is only strengthened by our acquisition of Brightree. We have added essential building blocks for our global cardio respiratory care strategy, particularly in connected care for COPD. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, for our partners and most importantly, for millions and millions of patients around the world. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett, who is in Sydney for his comments, over to you, Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter with more detailed commentary around revenue, given our acquisition this fiscal year. As Mick noted, we had a solid finish to the year. Group revenue for the June quarter was $518.6 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Excluding the acquisition of Brightree, revenue increased by 8% over the prior year quarter and excluding all acquisitions, organic revenue increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Taking a closer look at the geographic level and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $295.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pac totaled $194.1 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific also increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $161 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $134.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pac, device sales were $133.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $60.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, also an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior year quarter. I would now like to provide some additional information about the Brightree revenue contribution. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $28.9 million. On a pro forma full quarter basis, Brightree\u2019s revenue would have been $32.2 million. This represents the most relevant measure of Brightree\u2019s fourth quarter revenue run rate. The difference in our reported revenue and pro forma revenue is related to two items. First, a one-time $2.3 million fair value adjustment to Brightree\u2019s deferred revenue balances required under U.S. GAAP purchase accounting rules and second, the pro forma revenue of $32.2 million for the quarter includes a few days revenue that was not included in reported revenue due to the close of the Brightree acquisition on April 4. As it relates to acquisitions, during the quarter we also incurred $1.9 million in acquisition and integration related expenses associated with the Inova and Brightree acquisition. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted for the impact of acquisition and integration expenses associated with our acquisitions of Brightree and Inova, the amortization of acquired intangibles, the Brightree acquisition of one-time deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the SERVE-HF accrual release and the cumulative tax benefit associated with the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09. In the prior year comparable, that excludes the SERVE-HF accrual, amortization of acquired intangibles and the donation for UCSD and the ResMed Foundation. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margins declined by 20 basis points, reflecting typical declines in average selling prices and changes in product mix, essentially offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition. On a sequential basis, our gross margin increased by 90 basis points, largely attributable to the Brightree acquisition and a more consistent product mix. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margins to continue to be in a range of 57% to 60% for fiscal year 2017. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $133.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25.8% compared to 27.2% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for fiscal year 2017. R&D expenses for the quarter were $34.4 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 24%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to the year ago figure of 6.3%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for fiscal year 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $12.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.6 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $135.1 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $104.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $83.1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.74, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.59. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar. During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard that was issued in the U.S. called ASU 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. As a result of adopting this standard, we have recognized the full year tax benefit of $11.2 million and this provided us with an opportunity to increase our foreign cash repatriation to the U.S. with the additional tax expense largely offsetting the tax benefit. With this adoption and the increase in cash repatriation, our full year effective tax rate remained relatively consistent at 19.8% compared to the prior year tax rate of 19%. On a non-GAAP basis, we have reflected full year tax benefit from the adoption of this standard within our tax expense for the fourth quarter, resulting in non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%. Cash flow from operations was $143 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $27 million. For fiscal year 2016, we generated record operating cash flow of $547.9 million, an increase of 43% over the prior fiscal year. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares during the June quarter, however we may at any time elect to reinitiate the share repurchase program. At the end of June, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $444 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains modestly geared and very strong. At June 30, total assets were $3.3 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Laurel, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much for taking my question. I was just wondering if you are willing to tell us something about your new mask range, we have seen the 510(k) there and perhaps if you are not willing go into too much detail whether you are willing to talk about the opportunity to evolve the business model with the AirSense 10 and the connectivity piece? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Andrew. You are right in your caveat around the question, but we \u2013 for competitive reasons, we don\u2019t think it benefits shareholder value to go into the details of product timing and product launches. But as you noted, there is some activity there in 510(k)s and we do plan to launch at least one new mask before the end of the calendar year and that\u2019s all the information I will give on that. But in terms of your second part of your question, which was about connectivity and how we can use the fantastic ecosystem of connectivity that we have and the installed base of 2 million cloud-connected medical devices to interact with patients and the myAir application, where patients are connected directly to the cloud, we think it\u2019s great to liberate these data and then to provide actionable information to patients. We think patients should know how long they have had their mask and when it\u2019s time to replace their mask and we are seeing patients really engage in that. So we do think there is a strong link to that. And I think if you look at this quarter, where we saw 11% growth in masks and accessories in the Americas, clearly we have patients engaging on that front, more to come on new products and more to come on engaging patients over fiscal year \u201817. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks Andrew. Operator : Next online, we have Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much for taking the questions. A couple of things, Australian dollar has been up and down a little bit, but mostly down, how do we think about that impact for next year\u2019s gross margins? Mick Farrell : I will hand that question over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks Joanne. Yes. If you looked at it sort of year-on-year sort of Q4, we did see some, a little bit of benefit from FX in particular the Aussie. Going forward into FY \u201817, we have seen more recently, I guess that\u2019s sort of bit of an up-tick in Australian dollar, it strengthened a little bit against the U.S. dollar. So in that context if you look at it sequentially into Q1, that\u2019s probably around a 50 basis point headwind for us on the gross margin there, at least in this kind of the near-term. Longer term I guess, it depends where the Aussie dollar goes, but short-term, probably a little bit of a headwind, but you would have to think longer term, it should be still be beneficial for us with the Aussie, but it has strengthened recently and we really don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to go. Joanne Wuensch : Okay. And can you just take a bigger step back and talk about the sleep apnea landscape, how it may be changing competitively, one of your comments talked about some pressure on average selling prices, so anything as it relates to pricing or products would be appreciated? Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks Joanne. Well, the whole sleep industry landscape has changed fundamentally, I would say in these last 18 months since we launched, 18-plus months since we launched, approaching 24 months since we launched Air Solutions. And the basis of competition in the space is now changed to be not only do the devices have to be quieter, smaller, more comfortable, but they also have to be more connected. And we think that connectivity has really changed the space. It\u2019s meant that we are able to take waste out to increase adherence of patients and to remove some of the inefficient steps in the value chain and therefore extract some value for our partners our HME partners, our patient partners, our physician partners and also ourselves out of that. And so there is some mitigation of some of the historic price impacts. We don\u2019t go into details on that, but at a high level, I think that shift to value from price discussions has been a really beneficial one for us and our partners and the whole industry in general. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Great. My first one will be for Brett, just some of the moving parts on the tax line and maybe can you walk us through the benefit of the ASU, but also the additional tax expense that you incurred from the repatriation of foreign cash and just how much foreign cash was repatriated in the quarter? Brett Sandercock : Yes, I will give you a sense. So we did adopt that standard and what we did, I guess is we took that opportunity to increase cash repatriation and the tax expense associated with that largely offset that benefit. So you saw in our full year tax rate, it was pretty consistent with what we saw last year. To give you an idea on the repatriation, if you look at \u2013 we basically repatriated an additional $60 million this year compared to what we did last year, so quite significant for us. So we felt that, that was the best thing to do and just take the opportunity, I guess that would be implementation of the standard. So overall, if you kind of looked at our overall full year tax rate and tax rates going forward, I think it will continue to be pretty consistent. Anthony Petrone : Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe my follow-up would just be back on pricing a bit and maybe just a little bit more details on underlying pricing in sleep, specifically it relates to the competitive landscape, we did some checks earlier in the quarter and our understanding is Respironics came in with more of a price discount since the beginning of the year and additionally, we are hearing 3B Medical is sort of out there with more aggressive pricing, so any comments there would be helpful? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Anthony. We don\u2019t go into particular details about competitor A or competitor B. I will reiterate what I said before a little bit and I will maybe give to Jim Hollingshead, our President, Americas, to give a little more color and detail around the U.S. environment. But at a high level, I think the shift to value and the shift to talk about how much data you are extracting from devices, how you are getting that data into my customer, who for our customer, their customer is either the hospital or the physician or even the payer. And by providing those data, we are extracting value for their customer and their customers\u2019 customer. So you are sort of changing the conversation from a pure price one to a value one. And if your box is X dollars cheaper, but the value provided is X plus, then the discussion goes back to the value side of it. But with that as a prelude, Jim any further comments on pricing? Jim Hollingshead : Sure. I think everybody is aware that the big driver of pricing in the U.S. market has been ongoing Medicare changes to reimbursement and that\u2019s pressure that the market has been under for several months through the competitive bidding process. I think our results in Q4 show that our Air Solutions offers or our AirSense and AirCurve devices coupled with our software platforms create a lot of value. So we \u2013 our revenue grew against a huge Q4 comp last year precisely because we have really shifted, as Mick said just earlier, we have really shifted the nature of what we are doing with our HME customers to allow them to create more value out of their business. So our offerings allow them to increase their revenue and cut their operating costs and that\u2019s why our offerings have held up so well over the course of the year and continue to maintain share and volume growth. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks Anthony. Operator : Next, we have Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sean Laaman : Thank you, operator. Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Brightree, you have owned it for one quarter now, I don\u2019t know Mick, if you could give us a sense on the retention of existing customers and the uptake of new ones, just some commentary around there to give us something to work with would be fantastic? Mick Farrell : Sure Sean. Thanks for the question. Yes. So we are 90-days plus into the close of Brightree and beyond that from the announcement. And I can tell you these first three months or four months have been a really smooth transition. We have seen great contributions from Dave Cormack, the CEO, in this transition and the new appointment of Matt Mellott as the CEO. And apart of the \u2013 directly after the announcement, which was four months or five months ago that we announced the acquisition, there was a series of phone calls and I might hand it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the details. But Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Americas, and Raj Sodhi, who runs our global \u2013 is the President of our global business unit for healthcare informatics, along with Dave Cormack called all the top customers and individually spoke to them both in our core HME space and in the Brightree space and had really good discussions with them about what we were trying to do with this acquisition, which is help them and reinvest with them to take costs and waste out and to improve patient adherence and have better flow of data through the industry and extract value for all the partners. The conversations I had, which were with a small subset of those customers were very positive and we have seen very good customer retention. In fact no significant change in customer retention pre or post the announcement or the close of the acquisition on both the core business and on Brightree. But Jim, you were involved in a lot more of those calls, do you want to provide some more color for Sean? Jim Hollingshead : Sure. Thanks Mick. Sean, we have had by and large, very favorable responses from customers, whether they were individual customers on both sides, whether ResMed customer or Brightree customer or whether they were shared customers and there are several hundred shared customers out in the world. Initially, we had terrific conversations with customers and I think that the response has held up over time. We have maintained virtually all of our customer relationships with both businesses and any concerns that customers had about how the two units work together have been, I think have been effectively addressed both by the fact that we have kept Brightree operating as a separate commercial unit, separate sales force, etcetera and just in conversations that we have had. If I just go back quickly to one of the rationales for the acquisition was we were already working together out in the world making our customers business process is more streamlined. So we had data connections that were allowing an HME \u2013 so for example, in sleep, if you set up a patient on a ResMed flow gen, you could import all of the same data into the Brightree application and will go straight into our compliance applications with the click of a button. That kind of labor savings made a big difference. And I think customers see what we are trying to do, which is to extend our health informatics offering from the therapy into their back-office operations and just continue to add value by taking out costs and streamlining their business. And I think the customer response has by and large been very, very favorable. Sean Laaman : Great. Thank you, Jim. And just one quick follow-up, is there any reason for perhaps seasonality in the revenue for Brightree? Mick Farrell : Why don\u2019t I hand that over to Brett? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks Mick. Yes. Sean, that \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s very much a subscription model. So you would certainly, from that perspective, you certainly get much less seasonality. So it\u2019s less of an impact than it would be, for example, for our kind of core existing business, so less seasonality due to the subscription model. Sean Laaman : As I hope, Brett. Thank you. And thank you Mick. And that\u2019s all the questions I have. Mick Farrell : Thanks a lot Sean. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open. Ben Andrew : Good afternoon. I guess maybe a question for Brett to try to be direct, can you give us a sense of what the tax hit was for the $60 million of extra repatriation and because you keep saying largely offset, but can you be more precise? Brett Sandercock : Yes. I mean well, to that extent it did largely offset that side, so a slightly smaller number, but not \u2013 it\u2019s around that number. Ben Andrew : So very close to the actual incremental... Brett Sandercock : It\u2019s around that sort of $9 million, $10 million mark on the repatriation. Ben Andrew : Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s very helpful, Brett. And I guess the second question for me, as we look at the Brightree revenues, the $32.2 million, is \u2013 what growth rate does that represent year-over-year and how do you think about the sustainability of that growth rate or what should we be looking for, for the business in the next balance of the fiscal year? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks Ben. It\u2019s Mick here. One of the beauties of recurring software-as-a-service business model that Brightree has established over these last 7 years, 8 years, 9 years since they have been in business is that it\u2019s 80, 90-plus percent recurring revenue. And so you see a really steady flow, to Sean\u2019s question, proves a really steady flow, not much seasonality and sort of building up of per customer, per user, per member, per month, if you like, per user per month type of revenue models and they build up over time. We have seen really solid double-digit growth in Brightree year-on-year to get to where they are now and we expect to continue to do that. We really like the Brightree model. We really like what value it provides in the core business, which is its HME channel and partnership business. One of the upsides I alluded to in the prepared remarks, but I think related to your question there about growth and future growth is home nursing, home health and hospice channels, these two \u2013 as our population ages in the West and it\u2019s particularly focused on the U.S. market for this, there are some really exciting software-as-a-service revenue models, including iPad applications for home nurses directly entering data in the home that goes directly to the cloud, efficiency savings that are well ahead of the competition and really value that we can help extract for us and from new channel partners. And there is an upside for us and that there may be a large chunk of undiagnosed sleep apnea and COPD and untreated sleep apnea and COPD amongst those two channels. So there is sort two levels of upside. One is the core business is software-as-a-service and Brightree revenue in those two new channels, but secondly identifying patients for our core business in sleep apnea and our growing business in COPD. Ben Andrew : Great. And just to be again direct Mick, is that mid-teens growth for Brightree or is it lower than that, higher than that? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. It\u2019s going to be around that mid-teens number. Brett, you want to go into any further detail on that or are we good with that? Brett Sandercock : No, that\u2019s right, Mick. It\u2019s definitely tracking along mid-teens. Ben Andrew : Thanks guys. Mick Farrell : Thanks a lot Ben. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Saul Hadassin : Thanks very much. Good morning guys. Mick, maybe just one question, I wonder if you could talk to what you see as an industry growth rate, you have mentioned this in the past on previous quarters, where you think the industry is growing maybe in the U.S. and then rest of the world, just in a sense are you going ahead of markets, what do you \u2013 where do you see industry growth rates across the two key regions that you participate in? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Look \u2013 thanks for the question, Saul. We think the market growth rate for the markets that we play in is in that mid to high single-digits revenue range globally. And so we think hitting that 8% constant currency growth in EMEA and APAC we are slightly ahead of market growth there. We think we took some share in that sort of combined sleep and respiratory care space. And if you look at excluding Brightree, the core Americas business, excluding Brightree grew at 8% as well. And so again, I would say we are taking some share there, not a huge amount of share, but taking some share and against a very tough comparable from Q4 last year. We think that\u2019s a pretty good performance. And as we look forward, that\u2019s our goal, right. We don\u2019t accept market growth. We like to drive market growth. We like to have innovations that create opportunities for us to grow ahead of the curve and so we don\u2019t give guidance as you know, but we see the market growing in that mid to high single-digits and we like to meet or beat on a regular basis. Saul Hadassin : Alright. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks Saul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ian Abbott : Hi guys. Good morning. One thing, when you speak to DMEs, one of their focuses is on re-supply and they are focusing on trying to ship more accessories with masks and I am just wondering, from your perspective, how far do you think there is to go on this. And secondly, with your solutions with connectivity, how is that helping them? Mick Farrell : So good question Ian, I will do the first part and then hand over to Jim for some further details on the Americas and what we are doing in re-supply. As a personal user of an AirSense 10 device and an AirFit P10 mask, I like to change my mask on a regular sort of three monthly basis. Any patient who puts a piece of plastic on their face every day and wears it for six hour, seven hours I think would find that a hygienic and an appropriate thing to do. The numbers out there in the industry are far below that, well below that sort of 4x replacement per year. In fact I think there was some data from some governments showing around 1.8, 1.9 masks per year, which would mean lasting 6.5 months. Personally, I think there is a lot of runway as patients get more engaged with high deductible health plans and health savings accounts in the U.S. and take more control of their own healthcare, but they will invest the co-pay dollars or even full cash pay to receive that dot com type payments to get themselves involved in this as the deductibles go up and so on. But I am just talking from a personal patient experience. Jim, why don\u2019t you give sort of the broader U.S. market thought on that? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks Mick and thanks for the question, Ian. The first thing I would say is, just as Mick is relating his own experience, it\u2019s really important to remember that we have a very firm belief that re-supply is very good for patients. The experience of therapy for patients is always made better by fresh equipment. Equipment does wear out, it gets old, etcetera. And so when the experience with therapy is better it leads to better adherence and just better long-term health for the patient. So \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the reasons I think both ResMed and our customers seek to drive re-supply. It also happens to be good obviously for our customers business. We have been working with customers for years to help them to understand how to efficiently re-supply patients. And with the advent of our Air Solutions offering, we have been able to provide some software platforms that help to automate that process. And as a reminder, we actually have two platforms now with the acquisition of Brightree. We have a platform called ResMed ReSupply, which is a platform we built out of the acquisitions of CareTouch and Jaysec previously. And that\u2019s an automated re-supply platform that has both a software component and a call center live call and automated call component. And then Brightree has a platform called Connect, which is also an automated re-supply platform. Both of them create a lot of value for our HME customers because it allows them to re-supply in a very cost efficient, cost effective way. And we have seen very good growth, both in terms of number of customers joining these platforms and grow the re-supply through them over the course of the year and that\u2019s an ongoing phenomenon for us. So our customers are enjoying the benefits of it. It has helped our re-supply numbers obviously, so our accessory sales. And it helps patients. Patients love getting fresh equipment on an appropriate basis because it improves their quality of therapy, their quality of life. Ian Abbott : Alright. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks Ian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me, okay. Mick Farrell : Yes. Matt Taylor : So I just wanted to cover one thing with the gross margin, previously you had said that Brightree was going to add about 70 bps to 100 bps, is that about what you saw in the quarter and is that what we should think about as kind of the contribution for the next year? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Hi Matt. The Q4, it came pretty much in middle levels \u2013 it was 80 basis points that it contributed. And then look going forward I think I would stick with that range around that sort of 70 basis points to 100 basis points. Matt Taylor : Okay. And I guess with the moving parts that you alluded to before the Aussie dollars you talked about but also euro is going down, how does that factor into your guidance for GMs for next year, so what are you assuming? Mick Farrell : Alright. Matt, I apologize. I missed the first half of that question. Matt Taylor : Yes. I am just asking with the euro as well, euro is a little bit weaker in recent weeks, how are you thinking about those two major currencies for gross margin next year? Brett Sandercock : Yes. I mean that plays into I think \u2013 we talked about that a little earlier on. Just for \u2013 it does, I mean obviously, a weaker euro, a weaker pound or whatever it might be doesn\u2019t impact us there. If I looked at it just at least in this sort of near-term into Q1 with that sort of strengthening of Aussie and probably some weakening in some of the European currencies, we \u2013 I think all up probably at the moment, estimates probably a 50 basis point headwind for us going into Q1 and now it\u2019s just a question of, I guess then if currencies stay where they are from thereon in that you wouldn\u2019t see any further impact on a sequential basis. We might see a little bit on a year-on-year basis, but pretty volatile at the moment. So it\u2019s hard to say on that, but near-term, I would say it\u2019s about 50 basis points and of course that can change depending on what currencies do. But at the moment, I will put it around that kind of number. Matt Taylor : Great. And then can you just give us a sense of how to model the interest and other expense for next year, since you have the debt from Brightree, I think due to modeling some income, you had some expense this quarter, any parameters you can give us around the interest rate or the \u2013 your cadence of the debt pay-down to help with that number? Mick Farrell : Matt, the interest rate for us would be around \u2013 is rough number around that 2% mark in terms of funding costs on the interest \u2013 if you use that. Had Brightree basically the acquisition from close to the beginning of the quarter and I think we finished with kind of this net interest expense for the quarter around $2.4 million. So it\u2019s probably kind of a reasonable go forward number going into FY \u201817. Matt Taylor : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners. Please go ahead. Steve Wheen : Yes. Hi guys. Just a quick question on that GPO announcement that you made, are there any milestones in terms of volumes that are required and is there any sort of color you can give around how that will contribute going forward. And then just if we could Brett, go sort of talk on the gross margin outlook for FY \u201817 you have mentioned FX and you have mentioned Brightree, but just any other sort of moving parts that we should be mindful of? Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the questions. Steve I will answer the first one and as you indicated, I will hand it to Brett for the second. The GPO announcement was really as an example of us executing on that channel strategy and you may or may not see further press releases from us about other GPO and government contracts that we have over time, but we don\u2019t give details of any particular customer and milestones associated with them on a sort of milestone basis. Essentially these GPO contracts are hunting licenses and then you are allowed to go in hospital-by-hospital and move forward on it, but it\u2019s an upfront negotiated air cover for the sales folks to go in there and work with those 3,600 hospitals and 120,000 other providers and push forward on our respiratory care growth within the channel. So I said in my prepared remarks, more to come on that front. There will be a lot more to come. We might not put press releases out on all of them. It was really just an indicator of where we are moving on that front. Brett, do you wanted to take the second question about gross margin? Brett Sandercock : Sure. Yes. Steve, on the outlook there on gross margin, I guess as you know, there is a lot of moving parts on that. We have mentioned on FX if I look at certainly from a product mix perspective, it\u2019s definitely that sort of unfavorable mix is certainly moderated for us. It\u2019s far more consistent to the extent and Mick mentioned earlier in terms of new mask introduction and so on, you could probably expect that would be supportive on a product mix front as we get through FY \u201817. We have done \u2013 the team has been doing some really good work around the manufacturing procurement and so on. We have seen some of that come through. So I am quite positive on that. And then you have got, obviously the Brightree is now kind of built into that Q4 margin, but that will continue to be supportive as well. I mean you have the usual ASP declines and things like that coming through. But overall, in the mix I think some of the big unfavorable items are certainly moderating and potentially could have \u2013 as masks are introduced and so on, that should be beneficial. So overall, we have got \u2013 it\u2019s probably a near-term currency headwind that\u2019s a bit unhelpful. But overall, pretty comfortable with that 57% to 60% range and we are kind of more or less just about right in the midpoint of that range at the moment. So that\u2019s kind of how I would characterize the moving pieces. Steve Wheen : Great. Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the questions Steve. Operator : Next we have a question from the line of Chris Kallos with Morningstar. Your line is open. Chris Kallos : Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the cardiology trial Mick, from the sound of your \u2013 of the CAT-HF numbers, they are neutral to positive, does that now maybe reboot your efforts in cardiology and are you planning any more sponsoring of clinical trials in that space? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Chris. That allows us to talk to our sort of third horizon portfolio if you like. And we are absolutely dedicated to cardio-respiratory care since it\u2019s almost \u2013 I am not sure it\u2019s a medical term out there in the formal literature, it\u2019s something that we are really leading the market on and I would define it as sleep disordered breathing amongst atrial fibrillation, sleep disordered breathing amongst heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. And I would also include some play in hypertension and some other cardiovascular diseases. But clearly, the data from CAT-HF were incredibly exciting. I don\u2019t know if you had a look at the detail that was presented there at ESC or the Heart Failure Congress at ESC. But as you start to look at those clinical data and the level of clinical and statistical significance from a relatively small group of patients, it certainly indicates to us and if you talk to Chris O\u2019Connor, who is the primary investigator who was formerly at Duke and is still the PI on the trial, clearly our investigators in all the hospitals and all the clinicians involved want to do some follow-on work in the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction space. So it certainly gives me more excitement in the space. The clinicians are very excited about it, the nurses, the doctors and we would like to continue to invest in the space. And so we won\u2019t go into details about what an investment will look like large multi-year clinical trials or a lot of market development work or some combination of the above. But you will hear a lot more from us regarding that Horizon 3 growth opportunity, including the CAT-HF trial and follow-up in the coming quarters. Chris Kallos : Mick, just on that, is the data strong enough to incorporate into marketing to cardiologists and also these initiatives, are they in the next 2 years in terms of next steps, is that the sort of timeframe we are talking about? Mick Farrell : So the data are not strong enough for an indication for use or IFU to start marketing to cardiologists. So no, it would require a lot further work on that front. What you might see is some work with \u2013 we talked about that trial with Kaiser Permanente, where we did some work on U-Sleep. We might work with payer providers, who are looking at these clinical data saying that\u2019s exciting, we would like to work on that in some sort of IRB or other controlled environment. But yes, I don\u2019t want to go into sort of real details here on the final question of our Q&A about what that part of Horizon 3 will look like at this point, but what I will say Chris is you will hear more from us over the coming quarters as to what we are doing in the cardio-respiratory care space, but it\u2019s pretty exciting data from CAT-HF. I am glad you noticed that. Chris Kallos : Great. Thanks Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks Chris. May be one last question? Operator : Yes, of course. Your next question comes from the line of Will Dunlop with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Will Dunlop : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could please give more detail on your rest of the world flow gens growth and what countries perhaps and what products are driving good 11% growth there? Please. Mick Farrell : So I will hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO to talk about EMEA and APAC. Rob Douglas : Yes. Will, thanks for that question. We \u2013 as you saw, we reported pretty good results through there. We are not going to break it up by country, but we saw good continued take-up of the AirSense platform. We had previously talked about the value proposition really came on very strong, but it\u2019s been a little more work to get that value proposition going in some of the other countries. And we are very pleased with the progress going through there. And so we are really seeing good take-up across the board with that. So it\u2019s really been a good result. Will Dunlop : Okay. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks a lot for your question, Will. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark, so I will now turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : So in closing, I would like to thank the now more than 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. I am really proud of what the team accomplished, not just here in Q4, but throughout the whole fiscal 2016 to establish ResMed really as the world\u2019s leading tech-driven medical device company. Through clinical research, new features that expand our products and solutions and our acquisitions, we are transforming how healthcare is delivered and shaping a new frontier in connected care in respiratory medicine. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time. And we will talk to you again in 90 days. I will hand back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thank you, everyone, again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website in about two hours at investors.resmed.com. Laurel, you may now close the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes ResMed\u2019s fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd. Operator : Welcome to the Q1 Fiscal Year 2017 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marianna, and I will be your operator for today's call. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, Marianna, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated.

I will now hand the call over to Mick Ferrell. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us today, as we summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales from Brightree and strong growth in our device platform categories. For the call today, I'll review high level financial results, outline regional highlights and then discuss progress towards our ResMed 2020 strategic goals. Then, I'll hand it over to Brett who will walk you through financial results in more detail. We continued to see the benefits of our leadership in connected care. The ongoing value proposition of the AirSolutions software resulted in strong growth for device platforms in both sleep and ventilation. Brightree's value to providers also led to recurring Software as a Service revenue from that part of our business. At the bottom line, in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 11% on a year-on-year basis in Q1. Including financing costs, our diluted earnings per share was $0.62 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 5% year-on-year growth. We continue to balance revenue growth, gross margin improvements as well as ongoing investments in both R&D as well as SG&A, as we prepare for upcoming product launches across our global markets. Now for some regional highlights : The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by Software as a Service revenue from Brightree and 10% growth in that region in devices. Device growth was up against a robust 40% year-over-year comparable. The mask and accessories category in the Americas was flat in the quarter. We are very confident that we will drive strong growth with mask technology that we are launching this quarter. Just yesterday we started selling our brand new AirFit F20 product into our European market and we will launch another mask technology imminently in Europe. We tested both of these technologies with customers during the quarter and they were very well received in market trials with physicians, providers, and with patients. We plan to launch these new technologies into the Americas market during the current quarter. We are incredibly excited about these new products. In the Americas region, growth in devices was driven by the ongoing strength of the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 systems, powered by the cloud-based AirSolutions Software platform including AirView, U-Sleep and myAir offerings. In addition, we also saw solid performance in our respiratory care device platforms with the launch of cloud connected Astral ventilation systems. We achieved good growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions with balanced contributions from both devices and mask categories. We are now on a solid positive growth trajectory in ASV therapy in the region. We're seeing good growth in patient groups including central sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea and pain management. We will see mask and accessories growth accelerate as we move forward with current and very near future product launches in the category as well as ongoing resupply partnerships throughout fiscal year 2017. We will show some of our new mask technologies to physicians and providers in the U.S. next week at Medtrade. Patient, physician and provider feedback from controlled product launches have been excellent and we know these masks will be very well received as they transition to full market launch. Let me now provide an update on our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. We continue to lead the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have high-quality Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree that continues to grow strongly. We are on track with our work to integrate Brightree software functionality with our core AirSolutions platform. We continue to invest in a portfolio of cloud-based computing solutions that help HME customers become even more efficient and help them free up cash flow that can be reinvested to drive even better patient care. Connected care solutions are improving operating efficiency, eliminating waste, increasing therapy adherence and improving patient outcomes. We are growing our connected care solutions in COPD as well as linking our technology to include other chronic care applications. This technology is a valuable asset that we will continue to leverage and provide insight to channel partners. This foundation of connected care is an integral part of our long-term strategic plan. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand over to Brett. In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep-apnea business, we have achieved sustained year on year growth since the launch of the AirSolutions platform more than eight quarters ago. We were a sponsor at the annual meeting of AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association that was held last week in Minneapolis. One of the main themes at AdvaMed 2016 was the importance of digital health, and the convergence of technology from data analytics to connectivity to patient engagement. This represents a significant shift from two to three years ago. I was on a panel titled Unlocking the Transformative Potential of the Internet of things, with colleagues from Deloitte and Medtronic, one of the other med-tech leaders in this area of connected care. While many companies are talking about digital health and connected care strategies, just a few of us are leading the way to value. We now have well over 2 million 100% cloud connected medical devices sitting on patient's bedside tables, liberating data every day. We turn Big Data into actionable information, which can unlock value for the patient, the provider, the physician and the payor. We are helping to reduce costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. With our expertise in sleep and respiratory medicine, we are also taking the lead with digital patient engagement tools that drive therapy adherence. Since we launched AirSolutions, we have been actively involved in clinical studies that show increased patient adherence and customer efficiencies, as well as demonstrate the value of our AirSolutions platform. Technologies like their AirView and U-Sleep improve patient adherence from baselines of 50% to 60% adherence all the way up to 80% adherence and above. These are game-changing capabilities. We just announced the results from the world's largest study on sleep apnea and connected care using our MyAir technology. This study included over 128,000 patients. These data will be presented at the Chest Medical Meeting tomorrow in Los Angeles and without stealing too much thunder from the investigators, at the highest level, these online self-monitoring tools engage patients and improve adherence to therapy. In the MyAir study, we showed an absolute increase in adherence of approximately 17 percentage points. This represents a relative increase in adherence of over 24%. This adherence study was executed in our core sleep apnea market, but we know that these technologies and capabilities can be applied to our ventilation and to our portable oxygen concentrator technologies for use in patients with COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. During the quarter, we enhanced myAir with the launch of a new smartphone app, which has been very well received by patients. We now have well over 1,000 patients each day signing up for the myAir app. Patients love getting a daily myAir score for their sleep, learning about the quality of their sleep and learning about the quality of their breathing at night. Patients like to engage with their sleep health as much or more than their exercise health and the nutrition health. Our view is that these are three equal parts for good overall preventative healthcare. Moving on to the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. This quarter we announced positive results from a randomized controlled trial in the field of home oxygen therapy and home mechanical ventilation. The Acronym for this trial is HOT HMV. The data from this study were presented in September at the European Respiratory Society Congress in London. In HOT HMV, patients who received non-invasive ventilation in addition to home oxygen therapy had an astounding 51% decreased risk of re-hospitalization or death in the first year compared to patients who received oxygen therapy alone. Additionally, the patients who received at home NIV and oxygen experienced an average of 4.3 months without a hospital admission or death compared to 1.4 months for those on oxygen alone. The reduction in mortality speaks for itself for caregivers and loved ones. The extra almost 90 days without hospitalization also speaks to government payors and to private payors. In the U.S. market, hospitals face a Medicare payment penalty if COPD patients are readmitted to hospital within 30 days for any reason. A future where NIV and portable oxygen concentrators are standard of care to reduce mortality and reduce hospitalizations in COPD patients upon discharge is well within our second-horizon view. Turning to progress in our respiratory care product portfolio, more broadly, we launched cloud-connected conductivity for the Astral platform. We continue to enhance AirSolutions to provide more value for Astral so that it can provide value for COPD and neuromuscular disease patients and beyond. We are on track with the Inova acquisition integration process and we're leveraging our quality systems and product development expertise to further improve the Activox portable oxygen concentrator or POC platform. We expect to make good progress in the global rollout of Activox over the following 90 days and beyond. We have significant opportunities to grow POC revenue by selling through our global market channels throughout fiscal year 2017. COPD, as a reminder, is the number three cause of death in the Western world and it is the number two cause of re-hospitalization. We know that our spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products across our portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs for providers and improving outcomes to millions of patients with this debilitating disease. Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of long-term opportunities including sleep health and wellness, atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the broader field of chronic disease management. In the area of sleep health and wellness, we announced a sleep awareness partnership with The Dr. Oz Show through the use of the S+ by ResMed device. The S+ is the world's first non-wearable sleep device and smartphone app designed to help people track, better understand and improve their sleep. Dr. Oz dedicated an entire show to the field of sleep wellness with guests including Dr. Michael Bruce, a board certified sleep specialist and Arianna Huffington, the Co-founder of the Huffington Post who has written broadly about the importance of sleep health. The sleep awareness campaign involves selling thousands of S+ devices and tracking anonymous sleep data to create a database with over one 1 million nights of sleep. Dr. Oz plans to calculate what he calls America's overall Sleep Score and to announce the results at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas early in 2017. For ResMed, this is about driving the importance of sleep health and helping consumers realize that they need to go see their doctor if they have any risky breathing or shortness of breath. These and other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea and COPD impact overall sleep health and overall health. This will be a critical part of the overall sleep awareness work. Moving from sleep awareness to hard clinical data, we presented positive results from the CAT-HF trial this quarter. The randomized clinical trial results were presented at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual Conference in Florida last month by the cardiologist and electrophysiologist Dr. Jonathan Piccini. Dr. Piccini's analysis showed a reduction in atrial fibrillation burden for heart failure patients who used ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV therapy to treat their sleep disorder breathing. This is the first study to show that addressing sleep disorder breathing with ASV may improve cardiovascular outcomes for patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This is a large population of heart failure patients for which there is no Class 1A guideline therapy. Researchers are finalizing the manuscript for full publication of the CAT-HF study. We are excited about the patient outcome data and the potential opportunities to save hospitalization costs for the healthcare system globally. Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new mask technologies globally. We continue to lead in connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. Customers are voting for this technology by signing up for our patient engagement apps and by voting with their wallets. We are also leading the industry driving consumer awareness of sleep so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and healthcare providers for diagnosis and for treatment. We look forward to executing on our strategies to benefit physicians, providers, payors, and most importantly to improve the lives of tens of millions of undiagnosed sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world as we move forward. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett for more comments. Over to you, Brett. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 with more detailed commentary around revenue, given our recent acquisitions last fiscal year. As Mick noted, we had a solid start to the year. Group revenue for the September quarter was $465.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 13%. Excluding the acquisition of Brightree, revenue increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Excluding all acquisitions, organic revenue increased by 3% over the prior year quarter. Taking a closer look at the geographic level and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $267.9 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $164.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas' device sales were $145.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122.3 million consistent with the prior-year quarter. For revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $113.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms also an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $50.9 million, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 1% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the first quarter was $33.1 million. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers \u2013 the non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and one-time expense associated with the field safety notification. In the prior year comparable, I've excluded the amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was 58.9%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin increased by 90 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition, partially offset by an unfavorable but moderating product mix and typical declines in average selling prices. On a sequential basis, our gross margin increased by 70 basis points, largely attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we are narrowing our guidance range and expect gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60% for fiscal year 2017. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $128.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 15%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our SG&A expenses increased by 6% in constant currency terms. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.7% compared to 27% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal year 2017. R&D expenses for the quarter were $34.4 million, an increase of 27% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 21%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses increased by 8% in constant currency terms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of $9.4 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $111 million, an increase of 11% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $87.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $76.1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.62, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54. Overall, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the weaker British pound and a stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.1%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%. During the quarter, we initiated a field safety notification regarding potential degraded battery performance in our Astral device. Under the notification, we will replace all the batteries in our Astral devices. In our Q1 GAAP results, we have recognized a charge of $5.1 million for the expected cost associated with this action. Cash flow from operations was $86.2 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by an increasing net working capital balances during the quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $27.8 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior-year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we expect to recommence the buyback in fiscal year 2018. At September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $391 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.3 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion. And, with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have any additional question after that, please get back into the queue. Mariana, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners, your line is open. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the Brightree revenue growth. Just wondering, in the quarter whether or not you've seen any pushback from DMEs with regards to ResMed owning that particular software. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Steve. No, we haven't seen customers moving out of the Brightree system since ResMed acquired or announced the acquisition in February or closed the acquisition in April or has formally moved forward from then. So, we've had a good eight months of customers being aware of this, and what we've seen is customer love the value that's been provided. And they actually \u2013 I think the customers I've spoken to love the fact that there's a multibillion-dollar public company that's going to make sure they invest cash in this business for the long run, which is investing in the infrastructure and extracting value for our HME provider customers and adding even more value, as we integrate some of the functionality from Brightree, as we said in some of the prepared remarks, between Brightree and our broader AirSolutions platform across sleep apnea and COPD. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Okay. And is the gross margin on that revenue similar to what was reported when you gave the historical figures for Brightree when it was acquired? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Brett, do you want to drill down into some of the GM implications pre and post acquisition for Steve? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, it's Brett. I mean, yeah, that's pretty consistent with when we filed the 8-K, for example, on profitability ratios and, obviously, Brightree contributes to our gross margin there as well. Let's just say, we've got \u2013 I mean, it's consistent with our expectations. We're very pleased with how we're progressing and how Brightree is progressing. So I think that's good, probably, business there and it's definitely meeting our expectation. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: All right. Thanks very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mick, can you \u2013 or maybe Brett, can you talk about kind of the flat M&A or mask and accessory growth in the quarter? Maybe what are the inputs to that? Was it, perhaps, some people holding out purchases typical at the end of the quarter in front of the new product launch because you've been pretty vocal about having stuff coming? And then my follow-up is, within the 10% device growth, can you give us some flavor about the product mix and what the bigger drivers were within that across the range? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So, first, the EMEA and APAC masks and accessory growth was 4%. Americas was flat. Obviously, we showed these new technologies at the European Respiratory Society Congress in September and, as you noted, Ben, we've been pretty public about that and so it had been out in the public forum. There may have been some impact on Americas' customers knowing that new products will be coming to market soon in terms of their purchases during the September quarter. But look, the way that we look at it is, we've got some excellent first results here on our controlled product launches on this product, the F20. It's an excellent full face mask that we think is going to be incredibly successful as we've tested it out there. And certainly, there were some customers testing it in the Americas and some customers testing it in Europe, and we did show it at the conference there in European Respiratory Society, but we do expect very significant growth for this throughout fiscal 2017 and we will launch the product, as I said, we launched it yesterday in Europe. And we will launch it \u2013 another technology into Europe and both technologies we plan to launch into the U.S. this quarter. So, I do think the future looks pretty exciting on that front. To the devices, breaking out the 10% year-on-year growth in devices in the Americas, we don't typically break it out precisely between how much was ventilation and how much of the growth was sleep, but we talk about the sleep apnea market generally growing in that sort of mid to high single-digit number and devices growing in the mid single-digits and masks growing at the high single-digits. So you can sort of look at that 10% and say, well, if it's mid single-digits on the sleep flow generators then there's some incremental growth from the ventilation and the portable oxygen concentrators on top of that. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And, I guess, if you'll allow me, I'll just ask about Activox and how you might size the OUS opportunity as you launch that over fiscal 2017 because that's the first you talked about that rolling out more broadly? Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. Well, Ben, we'll give an update next quarter as we really start to roll that out. The point I was making in this call is that we've now got the quality to a level that we like and that we are launching it now throughout not only U.S. but our global sales forces over the coming quarter. And as you know, the sale cycle on POCs is an S-curve and you start to ramp that up this quarter, but we'll give an update in 90 days as to the progress on that. Thanks for the questions, Ben. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question. William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just firstly wanted to ask you about SG&A growth accelerated this quarter, and I'm wondering whether that's related to the upcoming product launches or if there's something else in there, if you could talk about that would be great. Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Will, there are two factors involved in SG&A. One is the absorption of some of the acquisitions we've made and that has contributed to the SG&A. And in addition to that, as you noted, we're launching two new masks in Europe and we plan to launch them in the Americas and these things that we prepare for. We've done them many times, but you do prepare for them in terms of the marketing, promotional capabilities and so on. So, those two factors of the acquisitions and the preparation to new product launches were both factors in the SG&A. William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And then, on gross margin, despite what seems to be quite a negative product mix effect in the U.S., you still posted very strong non-GAAP gross margin relative to the last few quarters. Can you just talk to the pricing environment in the U.S. and whether you are seeing pressure to cut prices and whether you think you will, as a result of Medicare funding cuts that went live in July? Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Will, I'll take the second part of that and I will hand it to Brett for the first part of that on the broader GM review and what's going on there. But with regard to pricing, we haven't seen anything out of the ordinary in pricing. You know this. Obviously, we don't break it out in detail here, but what I'd say is we've seen sort of what we've seen traditionally in year-on-year price deltas in our U.S. and other markets, throughout the whole CB process, it's been very visual and open as to what the new prices will be, and we've been working with our customers as soon as prices were announced six months ago, not as they start to go into play during this sort of July, August, September quarter. So, pretty steady as she goes in terms of historic price deltas there. But, Brett, do you want to provide a little color for Will with regard to what's happening there with GM? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, I mean, even though the product mix continued to be unfavorable for us, it's certainly moderating. That headwind has definitely moderated in this quarter, which is good. And the other thing also on ASVs, which is a pretty big headwind, our ASVs returned to a growth trajectory, and that's helping us on the product mix piece of this. It's not a headwind now. The biggest component there, I think, that has been driving through on the margins being manufacturing and procurement and sort of really getting some traction on those cost-out programs that we've been running all the time, but it's becoming more evident because of that product mix moderating. So, that's sort of working through. As you know, the first 12 months we couldn't really work on it. We were really concentrating or focusing on just meeting demand. But as we've worked through the last 12 months, we've been really able to ratchet up that program and the team's done a great job just working through on the various cost-out programs, particularly for the platforms. And that's definitely now flowing through on the gross margin. And, I guess, the other one, obviously, the Brightree acquisition is a meaningful contributor as well. So, I mean, I guess, you're saying some of these headwinds are perhaps turning into tailwinds. So we're seeing that come through on the gross margin. William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : David Low with JPMorgan is online with a question. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. If we could now return to Brightree, I was just wondering if you could talk to the level of growth you've seen given we don't have much in the way of historics and perhaps some sense as to what integration benefits or what the opportunity feels like it could be now that you've owned it for, I think, you said, eight months? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, the Brightree growth is in that sort of low-to-mid teens, low teens sort of area, good solid double-digit growth. It's 80, 90%-plus recurring revenue there, David. So the Brightree business is a very solid and strong recurring revenue business. It's providing incredible value to providers automating process flows for inventory management, clinical informatics management, revenue cycle management in terms of ensuring payment and also even managing physician scripts. And so, when you think about the synergistic value, if you like, between a customer who is operating on ResMed's AirSolutions for patient engagement through myAir and physician engagement through AirView and now HME engagement through Brightree, there are many of those workflows that you can look to if you are removing costs from the front-end of patient engagement and the back-end of inventory management that there can be synergies in saving those costs for the HME provider. And so, we are working with all our customers who use both AirSolutions, Brightree and particularly those who use both to really help them garner those savings in their own operating costs to improve their own P&L and free up more of their own cash flow to then reinvest in better patient care and drive adherence rates up of the likes of what we've seen in the myAir study and the U-Sleep where we're able to achieve 80-plus percent adherence rates. That's a win for the patient obviously, but it's also a win for the physician getting the patient on therapy and the provider in terms of keeping that sleep apnea patient on good therapy and ongoing resupply. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. Thanks. And if I could just change topics a little bit. You talked about the connected devices and I think more than 2 million connected with AirSolutions now. Just making sure that I understand, I mean, this is AirSense, AirCurve products, are the vast majority of those devices that you've sold effectively, connected devices now? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Since we launched the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 lines, every single sleep apnea non-invasive ventilation device that we've sold has communications capabilities in it and so we have more than 2 million of them \u2013 well over 2 million of them sending data to the cloud every day, so that if it's sent at 6 :30 in the morning, we call it the halo, hour after last off, by 7 :30 in the morning those data are available for the patient that they can review on myAir, for the doctor if they go see them at an 8 o'clock appointment on AirView and even for the government of Finland or United Blue Cross Blue Shield in terms of their population health management into their systems that very day. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. Thanks very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator : Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets is online with a question. Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our questions for \u2013 first for R&D and we're looking to see whether or not this increase in guidance is kind of the short-term related to acquisitions and integration or if this is kind of more of a longer-term strategy? And then my follow-up question is, with regards to the Curative acquisition, we're at the one-year mark. Is there any observations that you've made that were different from your initial expectations? Thank you very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions, Matt and I'll hand both of those, actually, over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO. Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yes, thanks, Matt. Yes, the R&D increase largely has been around bringing the acquisitions in and the engineering work that we wanted to do make sure quality is right and really synchronizing the roadmaps and making sure everything is on track. We're committed to innovating in our industry and we see the R&D program sort of continuing apace. We've got a lot more things on our roadmaps than what we can actually do and a lot more plans and ideas and anything we can invest sensibly into the R&D program we will. On to your other question regarding Curative, you're asking about any differences from how the early integration program went? We're really encouraged with Curative and its position in the Chinese market. The whole Chinese economy has had some interesting developments and changes and things going on like anticorruption drives and stuff like that have made the market continue to be interesting. We still see a huge opportunity there just in terms of the number of untreated patients, both in obstructive sleep apnea and also in the number of untreated COPD patients in the standard of care there. We're making great progress on the integration program. We're very happy with the role of a few key players that we've got in China at the moment. We've got Justin Leong, who's sort of heading up our Asia Growth Markets Group and Jason Sun, who's remained as the CEO of the Curative subsidiary and together they are bringing together the team of Curative and ResMed and we're the major player in treating sleep disorder breathing and long-term ventilation in China and we've got lots of good plans to further develop that. Operator : Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to know if you've got any early feedback on the launch of the new 20 series mask just from the market testing that you're doing? And then just a follow-up question is, to what extent does your outlook or your upgrade gross margin consider that new mask launch? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions, Andrew. Yeah, clearly, we've got some really good early data from the controlled product launches of F20 in Europe and in the U.S. markets in these sort of controlled product launches where we've had customers looking at the product, putting it on patients, seeing how the setup goes for a provider and working with physicians so that they can see the change of care. The F20 is a fabulous full face mask, one of the best I've seen that ResMed's produced and I think as you look forward over the next number of quarters, this thing is going to be a real winner for us. To your second part about upgrading our gross margin guidance, I'll let Brett go into that in more detail. But at a high level, yeah, there's a combination of ASV. As Brett said earlier, ASV has turned from a headwind now to tailwind. Mask growth is at its nadir here as we transition from two-year-old mask products to brand-new mask product and both of those tailwinds in terms of positive GM contributions. But Brett, any further color on that for GM? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Maybe we try to look at that and try to factor that in. As you know on gross margin, it's always hard to predict because you've got ASP movements, FX, product mix, geographic mix, what we do in manufacturing and procurement. What happens with how the acquisitions go on and so on, so sort of pool that in. But, I guess we're getting kind of more confidence in the range there on the margin and certainly we saw some really good improvements on the margin in Q1. And clearly we look to build on those. But in terms of the product mix, to the extent that the mask growth accelerates, then we think these masks will be successful and we do think we'll get shares back with these masks and clearly that's going to be supportive of the gross margin. And then it just depends on relative mix of devices versus masks and so on. But it certainly is \u2013 the expectation is those new masks will be supportive of the gross margin. I mean, you'd have to think that. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Yeah. Terrific. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is on the line with a question. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Just to follow up a little bit on the mask commentary, given that you have rolled that out internationally and we're going to see it next week at MedTrade, could you just talk a little bit about what are some of the unique or differentiating points that you see in the mask versus what you've been selling and how should we think about things from the cannibalization and pricing perspective? Is this environment one where you can ask for some uplift in pricing versus what you are charging right now? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Matt. I'll take the second part, and then I'll hand the first part to Rob to talk about some of the features of the F20. Yeah. With regard to pricing, we work very carefully with our customers in each of the 100 countries we're selling to and each market we're launching to. This is some very innovative technology in these multiple mask technologies that we're bringing to market. And we are certainly working with customers to understand that value and ensure the price is appropriately in line with that value. And, so I see it rolling in as we traditionally have with our mask launches at appropriate pricing that takes account of the value but also takes account of the realistic nature of the markets in which we're selling in the healthcare world. Rob, do you want to take the second part? Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: The first part of the question, second. Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. These masks are really about comfort and feel and ease-of-use. Our early testing \u2013 all of our mask development programs are heavily involved with working with patients and trying ideas and working through, and it's sort of iterative, it keeps going. But we believe the F20 and the N20 have really superior seal and that they just don't leak, and that they're more comfortable and easy to use than earlier masks. To your question of cannibalization, the market will pull out as to what are the preferences, and people will have to develop their preferences over time for that, and so that will take some time to fallout. But we are extremely excited about the response that we've already had on these masks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. What I would add on there is, if there is any cannibalization, it's cannibalization of some of the competitors' positions in full face and nasal. So we will not only keep going in the market as we are with Dr. Oz and reaching out to new patients in, but I think we'll be taking some good share in these categories as we launch this amazing new mask technology. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And then as a follow-up, just a little bit more color on the North American generator performance in the quarter. You had Astral, you said ASV is a tailwind, you are benefiting somewhat from the COPD purchase. Is it fair \u2013 and I know you have a really difficult comp here in fiscal Q1, but is it fair to say that that business is actually down when you exclude those other products or was it still positive? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: No, it was still up. We are not going to break it out in detail, but what I said earlier, I'll say again, which is the sleep market is growing mid-to-high single digits where the devices are growing mid-single digits, masks growing at high-single digits. We held share in our sleep devices. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Victor Windeyer from Citi is online with a question. Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Hi. Thanks very much. Look I just wanted to understand mask growth a little bit more, if I can on . The high-single digit mask rise, perhaps you could, like in the industry, if you like, but perhaps you could break out what is your number one volume growth and what the, I guess, the key factors are that are driving that. How long that can continue for? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for the question, Vic. With regard to mask growth, revenues and volume, we don't break out pricing delta. What we acknowledged in the prep remarks and I'll say again, we lost some share in masks in the quarter. If masks are growing at high-single digits in the U.S. market and we're growing 01, then we're losing some share. We're very confident with the new masks we are launching. Well, we are launching today, yesterday in Europe and over this quarter. We plan to launch them again in the U.S. and beyond in global markets that we will get back to not only strong market growth, but above market growth as I alluded to earlier. These are great masks that will move us up there. So we're seeing good market growth of mid-to-high single digits in masks and there's always price declines to play in there, so you've got low-double digit growth in volumes of masks in the market that really hasn't changed from Q4 to Q1. It's more about the product lifecycle of our two-year old masks and the brand new ones that are just coming to market. Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. I guess, I was interested in understanding the importance of your informatics platforms to driving growth in the mask and supply side, and whether you can with your position there, you may get a better part of the share of that going forward? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Clearly we have a very large investment in the infrastructure with healthcare informatics and AirSolutions. There's a much more direct relationship between the informatics and the connected care and the value we provide to the device growth. We've seen that very strong for now, eight quarters since the launch of AirSolutions, AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10. There is a connection to masks. Clearly, it's often linked when you think about it all the way through to the ReSupply program. So we have ResMed ReSupply, we have Brightree Connect. We have a number of offerings in the U.S. market, a number of different offerings for customers in EMEA and APAC where the go-to-market models are different. We're engaging patients better than ever. Patients are signing up to understand things like myAir and as part of that we're absolutely contacting patients to let them know when it's time for a new mask and then to push them through the system. And, so I do think that \u2013 and different markets of the world there's different ways of doing that. You're going to see \u2013 as you look forward over FY 2017, 2018 and beyond, a lot more interplay not only between the informatics and device, informatics and masks but also informatics in chronic disease management, keeping these patients out of hospital and providing holistic value to the healthcare system by what we can do. Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thanks so much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. Operator : Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question. Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks and good morning, guys. Mick, maybe the first question on the Astral and just if you could talk to what impact, if any, that field safety notice had? Also on sales and just what you see in terms of take-up of that device in the non-invasive ventilation category, please. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So I'll take the second part and hand the first part of it to Rob. Sales of the Astral in terms of its use, it's pretty broad. It's different in every market in the world and in Germany, it's far more used as a life support ventilator and in the life support ventilation side. In the U.S., it's kind of split between Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular disease and COPD. With the changes in reimbursement that have been announced recently and have been ongoing for a year-plus in the COPD side, we've actually been focusing since we have no entrenched sales in this field saying to the customers, do you want non-invasive ventilation like an AirCurve 10 SST Bi-Level type product or do you want Astral and for which types of patients would you choose this? We are working with physicians and providers to do that. And so, we're really partnering with our HMEs and with the physicians to make sure and keeping the whole context of the healthcare economics that are involved to make sure that the right therapy goes on the right patient and that it's sustainable over time. So that's how we look at NIV as well as LSV for neuromuscular disease and COPD. But as for the field safety notice, Rob, do you want to? Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So I'll just give a bit of background on it. We had a small number of reports of degraded battery performance. But there continue to be no adverse health effects from the degraded performance. And there are very clear mitigations for patients around it. But we felt it was the right thing to do to put out the field safety notice and alert ventilator-dependent patients and their carers about the issue, how they should mitigate the risks and where appropriate how to arrange for replacement batteries. It's a rolling replacement program. It is proceeding well, and we are communicating closely on an ongoing basis with the customers for this. We have to manage the patient population very, very carefully, of course, with this type of device. But the program is running along to plan at this stage. Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Saul. Operator : Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Good morning, everybody. Two quick questions. Mick, the first one is the \u2013 and I might have missed it, the time to full rollout of the new mask series. So when will it be available to all of your customers? And, secondly, I don't know if you could give us a sense of organic growth. I know you've split out Brightree nicely for us but broad organic growth for the rest of the business would be great. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: So I'll take the first part, and I'll give the second part of the question to Brett. So the time to the full rollout \u2013 one thing, we're obviously very open here on a public conference call, but we don't want to give full indication to our competitors as to the date, the time and the hour of the launch of the F20 in each of the specific country markets. I'll talk broadly to the fact that we've launched in Western Europe yesterday. So this is available across major countries in Western Europe already and that our plan is to launch into the Americas and the U.S. specifically this quarter. But I don't really want to go into any more granularity than that for competitive reasons on this call, Sean. But I can tell you this thing is going to take off and it's going to be a very valuable mask as it rolls to each of those countries as we launch it. Brett, do you want to have a breakdown of the acquisition versus organic growth question? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. I mentioned that earlier Sean, so the organic growth in revenue for us was 3% this quarter. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Okay, great. Thank you. That's all I have, guys. Thank you very much. Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean. Operator : Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the breakdown of the acquisitions. Can you just talk about not just the top-line growth, how much did acquisitions contribute to the bottom line this quarter? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Brett? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Matt, we've sort of broken down and given more details in terms of revenue but we haven't gone down line by line or segmentation out in terms of the acquisition. So at this discussion, we would prefer to keep it that way. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Just curious... Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: I will say that, you know, I mean, you know that in the 8-K on Brightree, for example, which is the largest acquisition by far, the ratios are not inconsistent with historical, so that will give you at least a sense of it. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, I want to address, there has been a number of initiatives that have been talked about by the government in terms of being on kind of a watchlist with sleep testing with vents. I guess, is that a risk that you see for any of those parts of your business or do you think this is sort of just normal activity on the part of the government with regard to some of their investigations? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes, Matt, look, I think the government has regularly looked at their spending in all parts of healthcare whether it's in pharma, in different areas of med-tech and clearly, this is something that is important to make sure that the government's money is invested well. There are 40 million to 60 million Americans who suffer from sleep apnea and we've only got 6 million of them who are suffocating \u2013 6 million of them on therapy. We need to get to the other tens of millions and it needs to be done appropriately and economically. And we are partnering with every government where we do business to make sure that we can appropriately and economically diagnose and treat those patients and keep them out of the hospital care system because it's much less expensive to have a patient safely breathing at home than badly breathing and needing to visit the ICU or CCU. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for the thoughts. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Chris Kallos from Morningstar is online with a question. Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Thank you for taking my question. Sorry to go back to gross margin, but just on the Brightree acquisition, I think previously you've mentioned that that would have added between 70 basis points and 100 basis points. And I'm just comparing that to the actual results this time around, and I know there are multiple factors here but can we \u2013 is it possible to sort of get a correlation between what you expected Brightree and what it actually has added this time around to gross margin? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Chris, this is Brett. It would be that the Brightree contributed at the top of that range for this quarter. Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: So out of the 90 basis points, most of that is Brightree? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: No, there's basically positive and negative, right, so it's going to be \u2013 in absolute terms it's going to be, as I said, on top of that range we said I think 70 to 100 and that's towards the top of that range in terms of basis point contribution. But then in case you have any impacts from ASP declines, you have negative impacts from product mix still flowing through. But we had good contributions, very strong contribution from manufacturing procurement improvements and then also Brightree. They're probably the kind of the four big elements that are playing out on the gross margins. So you can't \u2013 you've got kind of -it's a mix situation that you end up with. Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Sure. So, it's tracking as expected more or less? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Yeah. And Brett, can I just trouble you for the device sales non-U.S? Again, I just missed that number. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Device sales non-U.S. 6% was the EMEA and APAC constant currency growth. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Great. That's it for me. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : We are now at the one-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Marianna. And in closing, I want to thank the now more than 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020 literally by giving a product that helps the patient who is suffocating or couldn't breathe before, breathe afterwards. Thanks for your time today and we'll talk to you again in 90 days. Agnes? Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you again for joining us today. If there's any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investor.resmed.com in about two hours. Marianna, you may now close the call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes ResMed's first quarter of fiscal year 2017 earnings live webcast. You may disconnect.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marianna, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Marianna, and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially, are in the forward-looking statements detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Security and Exchange Commission. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders, as we summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales from Brightree and continued strong growth in our device platforms. We also saw the start of a steady ramp our latest mask technologies. For the call today, I will review top level financial results, outline some regional highlights and discuss key announcements this quarter. Then, I will hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. We achieved strong device sales due to our leadership in digital health and connected care. The number of patients managed on the AirSolutions platform and the number of daily uses of our Brightree platform continue to grow rapidly. This quarter, we announced that we have reached a milestone with more than 1 billion nights of sleep data in our cloud-based physician and provider solution called AirView. We have well over 2 million, 100% cloud connected medical devices. We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers and patients like never before. Midway through the quarter, we commenced the launch of our new AirFit range of mask, the AirFit N20 nasal mask and the AirFit F20 full face mask. Both of the products leverage new step change technology called Infinity Seal that provide significant advances in fit and comfort to the patients. Earlier this month, at the JPMorgan healthcare I announced that we had received FDA clearance for the ResMed AirMini, our world leading, travel friendly, sleep app technology. I will talk more about that a little later. At the bottom line, in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-over-year basis in Q2. Including financing costs, our diluted earnings per share or EPS was $0.73 on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring an appropriate investment in both R&D and SG&A, so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across our global markets. Now for some regional highlights. The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree and 13% growth in devices. Device growth was particularly remarkable given that we were up against a 24% year-over-year comparable. The mask and accessories category in the Americas grew 4% in the quarter. This is up sequentially and reflects the fact that our sales team that received products around Thanksgiving timeframe has started showing the new technology to physicians and providers. There is clearly a long way to go in the ramp of these products in Q3, Q4 and into fiscal year 2018. Growth in devices was driven by the continued support for the AirSense 10 systems by our customers. These are powered by the cloud-based AirSolutions software platform, including the myAir patient engagement app that has over 1,000 new patients signup every day. We achieved good growth in our respiratory care device platforms in the Americas, particularly our cloud-connected life support ventilation platform called Astral. We earned strong growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions this quarter, primarily driven by Flow Generator sales, with some outstanding performance from our combined Curative and ResMed China businesses. We have now completed the earn out and the integration is going very well. As we enter the Chinese New Year, we have truly formed one ResMed China team with one vision, one mission, two brands and many and varied customer channels, the thing is really coming together well. Mask, accessory and other sales in the combined EMEA and APAC regions were down year-over-year due to a couple of factors, one we had some international licensing revenue from the comparable quarter a year ago in the region and two, the N20 and F20 were only released in a few countries, and as we know uptake of new masks is a lot slower in EMEA and APAC then the U.S. market. We expect this mask category to return to public growth in EMEA and APAC as we continue to launch the N20 and F20. Feedback from patients, physicians and homecare providers on the fit range and comfort of the N20 and F20 are very positive. This is a great indicator for stronger mask growth in Q3, Q4 and into FY 2018. Looking at our Software-as-a-Service revenue Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model in the low-to-mid teens. We are on track with our work to integrate Brightree software functionality into the AirSolutions portfolio. We are truly creating end-to-end software solutions for our customers and Brightree is achieving strong double-digit growth, with high levels of customer's satisfaction and customer workflow efficiencies gains. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable products, catalyzed by digital health and connected care solutions. We launched our new AirFit F20 full size masks and our new AirFit N20 nasal masks in the second quarter. The Infinity Seal technology is a step change in comfort for patients and fit ranges of 97% to 99% of patient populations approving a winning value proposition with respiratory clinicians. We are seeing exceptionally strong demand for the N20 and F20 products and for some of the masks SKUs demand is in fact outpacing supply as we ramp up our production capabilities for these new technologies. We will continue to ramp up our supply and expect to be out pacing demand as we go through Q3 and into Q4. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier this month, we announced the FDA clearance of the world's most CPAP called the ResMed AirMini, it's a tiny portable travel PAP with all of ResMed's best in class comfort features. AirMini is intended to be a secondary device for travel, and it truly compliments our world leading AirSense 10 platform. AirMini is an amazing technology and we expect to launch this product commercially before the end of the fiscal year. I have personally been using a prototype of the ResMed AirMini for over 12 months. It has traveled with me to Asia, all over Europe and throughout the Americas. For those listening to this call, who may also be CPAP patients feel free to go to airmini.resmed.com and signup. We\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019re amongst the first to know when the product is fully launched through our Homecare Channel Partners. We continue to lead in the field of connecting care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have reached as I said earlier 1 billion nights of sleep data and are focusing on algorithms to convert big data into actionable information. The ultimate goal is to unlock even more value for physicians, providers, payers and most importantly for patients. This quarter, we announced results from a European study published by PricewaterhouseCoopers analyzing data from more than 23,000 patients in Germany and the UK. The study shows that myAir patients when compared to controls, used their CPAP devices for longer durations and have significantly higher adherence rates. This adherence study was executed in our core sleep apnea vertical, we are extending this cloud based coaching algorithms to our ventilation and oxygen technologies, watch this space. This is a great transition for the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy. We know that COPD is the number three cause of death and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in the western world. The spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products across our ResMed portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs for providers and improving outcomes for patients with this debilitating disease. Connected Care in ventilation can reduce costs and improve patient outcomes in COPD and beyond. We continue to see portable oxygen concentrators or POCs as an important addition to our spectrum of respiratory care products. Our integration of the Inova acquisition has focused on quality improvements to the current Activox POC platform. We are gradually ramping the launch of this technology to our global sales team as we continue to improve quality and functionality of the product. We will ultimately add cloud connectivity to our POC platform which will help drive adherence for patients, fleet management for providers and activity tracking for physicians. Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of long term opportunities including sleep help and wellness as well as clinical adjacencies, such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Another key area of horizon three growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, health care analytics, care co-ordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice. In the area of sleep help and wellness we are making good progress with our new joint venture called Sleep Score Labs with capital investments from ResMed, Pegasus Capital and Dr. Mehmet Oz. We started the partnership last quarter with an entire Dr. Oz show dedicated to the field of sleep wellness. Dr. Michael Bruce and Dr. Oz leveraged the S+ by ResMed the world's first non-wearable sleep device and Smartphone app designed to help people track, better understand and improve their sleep. The sleep awareness campaigning encompassed anonymous sleep data from a database with over one million nights of sleep. Sleep Score Labs calculated America's overall sleep score and Dr. Oz announced the results at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas earlier this month. Dr. Oz reported that people are not sleeping as well as they should, we're getting less than what the National Sleep Foundation recommends which is seven to eight hours plus of sleep. We are about one hour behind the minimum with around six hours of sleep. People say they're tired and people say they want to understand their sleep better. Sleep Score Labs will do just that, they will truly quantify sleep and help people objectively determine which sleep solutions are best for them. For ResMed this is about driving the importance of sleep awareness and sleep health. We will be helping people realize that they need to go see their doctor if they have any risky breathing at night or any shortness of breath day or night. These and other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea and COPD impact overall health. We will continue to drive sleep health and sleep awareness and our ResMed brand as a leader in the field. Let me close with this, we are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017 including the new ResMed AirMini. We continue to lead in connected care with enhanced solutions that lower cost for providers and improve outcomes for patients. We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep, so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and healthcare providers. We continue to bring out strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and most importantly to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world. With that I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you Brett. Brett Sandercock : Right, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted we had a solid quarter. Revenue for the December quarter was 530.4 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 18%. Excluding acquisitions in constant-currency terms organic revenue increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $293 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $203.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $154.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $146.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 21%. Masks and other sales were $57 million, a decrease of 7% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms a decrease of 4%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 17% for masks and other increased by 2% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the second quarter was 33.8 million, with growth on a prior year comparable basis continuing to track in in the low to mid-teens. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted impact of amortization for acquired intangibles, acquisitions related expenses associated with additional contingent consideration, restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and the release of the SERVE-HF accrual. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the December quarter was 58.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 20 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition. These were partially offset by product mix, typical declines in average selling prices, and unfavorable currency movement. Due to current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margins to continue be in the range of 58% to 60% for the balance of fiscal year 2017. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $139.3 million, an increase of 18% over the prior-year quarter and in constant currency terms, also an increased to 18%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, and in constant-currency terms, our SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.3% compared to 26% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for the balance of fiscal year 2017. This reflects expected marketing expenses associated with product launches and ongoing legal expenses. R&D expenses for the quarter were $38.2 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter, or on constant currency basis, an increase of 28%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses in constant currency terms increased by 11% over the prior year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was 11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 7.3 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was 10.8 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 131.6 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 103.3 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was 76.7 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73, consistent with the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54. Note that our prior year earnings per share comparable was restated as a result of the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09. Whereby we recorded a tax benefit of 5.1 million in Q2 FY16. In the current quarter, under the standard we recorded a tax expense of 25,000. Excluding this impacts non-GAAP earnings per share would have increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted second quarter earnings by $0.03 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impacts from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%. And looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%. During the quarter, we recognize restructuring expenses of 4.4 million associated with rationalization of our European R&D activities. Additionally, we recognize an expense of 10.1 million for additional contingent consideration associated with acuity acquisition. The additional accrual was the result of the business achieving performance milestones that result in the investment contingent consideration payable under the purchase agreement. Finally, we recognize an expense of 8.5 million is part of global settlement of all litigation between ResMed, BMC and 3B. Cash flow from operations was 119.9 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by modestly increase in net working capital balances during the quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 14.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 27.7 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we expect to recommence the buyback in fiscal year 2018. At December 31st, we had approximately 1.2 billion in gross debt and $380 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31st, total assets were 3.3 billion and net equity was 1.7 billion. And, with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Mariana, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question. David Low : If we could just start with the mask rollout. Mick, you mentioned that you've had some issues with keeping up with demand and you've also talked about the rollout into other countries outside the US. I was wondering if you could just expand on those two issues, and wondering particularly whether that production issue means that the rollout internationally might take a little longer. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question David. Look the patients and provide and clinician acceptance in the mask has been great. The Infinity Seal technology particularly and its ability to reach 97% to 99% of the patients that coming to a sleep lab or through a clinic. And so these acceptance has been great and certainly exceeding what we had thought it may be. And so what we\u2019re finding with the new production technology that we\u2019re using for this infinity sale is that, as we ramp across the different stock keeping units, that in some of those SKUs, we are not keeping up with very high demand, but as we look forward over Q3 and Q4 we will start to catch up and we will expect by certainly, the end of Q4, that we\u2019ll be well ahead of the demand for the product. Rob, do you want to add something on that? Robert Douglas : I said, regarding the rest of the world rollout, the volumes in the U.S. are much larger than elsewhere in the world and we really don\u2019t see a big impact on the rest of the world rollout, that will continue slow and steady progress as we reported previously. David Low : Great. Yes, looking at it obviously, it seems like a good problem to have if you can't keep up with demand. Just the other question I had, Brett, you mentioned in the SG&A commentary, you've given us guidance, which I think is above what we've just seen and I think you made a comment about legal expenses. Just wondering if that relates to the settlement that's already happened or are we talking about other ongoing legal expenses? Brett Sandercock : No, that\u2019s really the ongoing legal expenses Dave, I mean, we're into, obviously, legal action with S&P, so that's not inexpensive. David Low : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question. Andrew Goodsall : Probably a follow-on call, sorry, follow-on question from David, just trying to get a bit more granular on the N20 series. Just the 4% mask growth you saw in the U.S., just if you're willing to characterize, was that mainly the N20, I guess, after a sort of flat growth elsewhere? And just also any feedback from the pilots that you guys ran on those masks? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Andrew. Well both the N20, which is mask, and F20, which is the full face mask are doing very well. They both have the Infinity Seal technology this year, single-layer technology that provides excellent fit and moment for patients, I personally wear a CPAP mask and the N20 is particularly comfortable for me, but those products are going very well and doing well in the U.S. market and that\u2019s what got us to the sequential uptick in the U.S. mask growth and we expect to, as we go through Q3 and Q4 and pick our production up to continue to grow quite strongly there and to turn back to a positive growth in EMEA and APAC. Andrew Goodsall : Any new feedback from the pilot? Did it meet your expectations in terms of the way the DMEs are thinking about this mask ahead of other masks? Mick Farrell : Yes, certainly as the DME or HME home care providers, as we call them in Europe start to see this product, that fit range, fitting 97% to 99% of the patients that walk through the clinic has just been a real winning value proposition for the respiratory technicians. The N20 is the go to mask for nasal now for them. And the F20, we believe is a go to mask for them on full-face, and its early days in the rollout, the U.S. team got this at the weak of Thanksgiving, they\u2019ve really only had half a quarter and one with the bunches of Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, but we do expect as we look for Q3 and looks to Q4 and start to ramp the production up, that\u2019ll be a slow steady gradual increase in both the U.S. and in other regions through Q3, Q4 and of course beyond FY2018. These technologies have a lot of legs. Andrew Goodsall : That's great. And I just want to think of that 4% as a good lead indicator of the early success. Mick Farrell : Correct. Andrew Goodsall : Okay. That\u2019s great, really appreciated. Thank you. Operator : Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is online with a question. Joanne Wuensch : Couple of things. You mentioned the impact of lower ASPs and mix on the expense structure. Could you expand upon that just a little bit? Mick Farrell : [Multiple Speakers]. Brett, you want to take that? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Just on -- that was really truly that the gross margin year-on-year that kind of ASP product mix is probably the biggest one year-on-year, we\u2019re still seeing, well we\u2019re seeing that really strong device growth continuing and unfavorable FX impacts was quite a bit too. If you just look at it sequentially, Joanne, it was 60 basis points, but we had unfavorable FX of 40 basis points. So it was -- that was probably the drivers you look at on a sequential basis. Joanne Wuensch : Okay. That's very helpful. Share repurchases, when are you likely to restart those, given your cash flow in the quarter? Brett Sandercock : Yes, we\u2019re still of the view that we\u2019ll commence that in FY18. Joanne Wuensch : Okay that\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it back. Thank you very much. Operator : Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is online with the question. Margaret Kaczor : Brett. The first question is really what drove the acceleration in Americas devices and the number was pretty big. The question is, it sustainable and can your mix of new products and ASV offerings really keep that revenue growth profile for ResMed in the low double-digit or teens range? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question Margaret, it's Mick here. So we did have very strong growth in devices in the Americas, it's 13% on a constant currency basis. We think that was primarily fueled by AirSolutions, the portfolio of AirView and myAir capabilities to lower the labor costs for setting up a CPAP by 50%, 60% for a home care provider. Also the ability for engagement apps like myAir to drive adherence from previous industry standards of 50%, 60% up to 80%, 87% in some of the data that we have talked about publically. So we think all that comes together to drive good sustainable growth and that does of course include some of the growth in the respiratory care line, our Astral ventilation, our life support ventilation line. Look we talk in terms of the industry growing in the mid to high single digits. Clearly, we were taking some share in devices in this quarter and you know as we look forward we'd expect to see you know good mid to high single digit growth of the industry and we'd like to lead or beat that and clearly we beat that this quarter. Margaret Kaczor : Okay and then maybe a similar question on the international side. Obviously you had strength international generator, so was there anything specific to this quarter? And then I hate to sneak one more in, but the constant currency of mask growth what was it excluding the licensing fees that you referenced at the beginning of the call? Mick Farrell : Okay, I'll hand it to Rob to talk about international devices and licensee. Robert Douglas : Yes, so Margaret, the factors driving the international sales are similar to the ones driving the U.S. sales, just that the sort of the ramp has been different as the take out from the whole process of explaining AirView and getting the myAir going is a longer process. Then the other really significant thing in the rest of the world data, outside of the U.S. data is China had a big impact, and so we had a very strong quarter in China, really related to the teams getting together and our integration plan going really well. And the team all pulling together focusing on new channels, really getting the sleep business and also really driving our respiratory care business in China. And then of course you know the Q2 is sort of like the end of year in China, is traditionally a strong quarter for us. Mick Farrell : The only thing I'd add to that, Rob, which I think is really good is that ASV turned from the post survey check where it was a headwind into a tailwind again. And so we're starting to see growth in ASV, not just in complex sleep apnea and central sleep apnea, but the pain management and in the U.S. in the PTSD category. So all that together, Margaret, is sort of what's one of the tailwinds driving those strong device numbers. Margaret Kaczor : Thank you. Operator : Matthew Taylor from Barclays Bank is online with a question. Matthew Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question can you hear me okay? Mick Farrell : Yes, got you loud and clear Matthew. Matthew Taylor : Okay great. So one question I wanted to ask is you announced the settlement of all your litigations with BG. And I just wanted to know if you could help us understand what the ongoing impact is going to be in terms of the licensing royalty revenue that you could see and the lower legal expense that you could have, now that you have this settlement. Mick Farrell : I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis, our Global General Counsel, Dave. Dave Pendarvis : Thanks Matt, first of all we're really pleased with the settlement. We think that it is helping to validate the strength of our IP that we're now going to get paid royalty on sales in the U.S. by our competitor for the products that are covered by the deal. The reality is, those royalty streams will not likely be material to us going forward and you know that's fine. They don't have a large market share in the U.S. market. We don't expect that to change anytime soon. So we don't expect it to be material. Obviously there is a reduction in the ongoing litigation cost that were associated with that case and really a number of cases around the world, but as Brett mentioned earlier we continue to have really, frankly a larger case against F&P and some other ongoing legal expenses. So there still will be significant legal expenses going forward. But obviously one of the reasons you settle cases is to the avoid the further ongoing expense and that was one of the reasons that motivated us to reach this settlement with BMC that we did, but we're very pleased with it. Matthew Taylor : Great and then just a follow up on an earlier question. I mean it's a little bit surprising that's late and kind of the flow gen launch to see such a big acceleration, was there any kind of stocking order or anything else that was abnormal that you would call out or was this just a good execution quarter? Mick Farrell : Yes, Matthew I think it was really about good execution. The value proposition of AirSolutions has shown itself to be very sustainable. It's a sustainable compelling value proposition for customers. When you're reducing the costs of therapy setup by 50% or 60%, it's just embedded -- becomes embedded into the work flow and just how our home care provider partners like to work, they like to work with the cloud-based system. They like to work with one that's lower costs and drives adherence. And so as Rob said there was some sort of good acceleration in China and some good sales of our China team running through the tape. But then globally we're seeing the AirSolutions platform have a really good impact and Astral as it comes into play and is now part of the cloud-based or cloud connected system, is getting some good traction as well. And then the third factor is ASV, the Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology coming to a tailwind. So all that together has provided strong flow generator growth and we expect strong growth to continue. And obviously the rates will be what they'll be, but mid-single digits -- mid to high single-digits is what we see the market going at and again we'd like to meet or beat that. Operator : Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question. Sean Laaman : I've a question on Brightree. So good revenue number there ahead of us. I was just wondering, Mick, if you could give us a sense of I guess some of the CPAP share dynamics and some of the resupply dynamics you've seen amongst new adopters of Brightree? That's the first question. Mick Farrell : Thanks Sean, I think I'll hand that question over to Jim Hollingshead, who runs the Americas. I'll just start off with, yes the low to mid-teens growth from Brightree is strong, again it's a compelling value proposition for our home care providers, and they like it incorporated into their work flows. Jim, any further color with regard to ongoing resupply sales associated with Brightree? Jim Hollingshead : Yes, the Brightree platform, if you think of it from a point of view of the core sleep business is an extension of process automation. And so there's a lot of affinity between new Brightree customers and customers who are users of the AirSolutions platform and the data connection between the two of those platforms makes it much easier for them to continue do that. And so it's -- even though the two businesses have separate commercial teams, separate sales team out in the market they tend to reinforce each other in the market. Brightree customers tend to have a very good experience with ResMed sleep products and back and forth. And then the Brightree software platform for a resupply which is called Connect is getting increasing adoption in the market. It's very valuable for the customers who adopted it and it's very-very good for patients because it drives regular resupply for patients and they therefore have a better experience on therapy and that is a growing part of their offer. Sean Laaman : Sure, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up when might we see the P20? Mick Farrell : Sean, we don't talk about future pipelines to a great extent. We did open up a little bit on this call about the ResMed AirMini, the world's smallest travel seat CPAP that we got FDA clearance on, that was a public FDA clearance, but we won't be talking about the pipeline of future masks. But thank you for the question. Operator : Will Dunlop from Bank of America is on line with a question. Will Dunlop : Just firstly on pricing in the U.S. I think you mentioned a few quarters ago that you had gone early with customers in reducing price prior to the introduction of competitive bidding on 1 July. Not all customers, but some I remember you saying. Just wondering when you might cycle those price reductions and you might see maybe a more favorable pricing environment in the U.S.? Mick Farrell : Will, I think you're referring to something maybe 18 plus months ago, where they were some changes around competitive bidding round two. So 18 almost, 24 months ago [Multiple Speakers] when there were some resets. William Dunlop : I'm referring to the latest round of competitive bidding. [Multiple Speakers]. Mick Farrell : So, okay. Well if it\u2019s related to that they know that what we\u2019ve being saying, which is the reality around the competitive bidding round three and round three national expansions, and the rebids going on now is that it\u2019s pretty steady pricing picture, in fact no step change at all. Industry normal price changes year-on-year in a steady pricing environment. Obviously, we\u2019re seeing a lot of competition amongst the innovation. Innovation in the masks and innovation in the cloud connectivity and connected care side. So intend complication for us and our competitors in masks and digital offerings. But in terms of price it\u2019s been a very steady environment last four, eight, plus quarters. William Dunlop : Okay. Thanks. And then could you just talk to demand for the AirSense in Europe please? Mick Farrell : Sure. Rob, do you want to address? Robert Douglas : We don\u2019t really break it out, but as I said before the value proposition around AirView and the connectivity is the same in European countries as it is in the U.S. It's just that some sort of the dynamics of how people understand the value and create the value is different and it takes -- has taken more time to build that up. In particular, in France, we had talk about, there was some legislation or some rules supporting that that was going to effectively create a differential reimbursement. So there was more reimbursement, the devices that were monitored wirelessly. And that was then knocked out in a court case, but subsequently that rule has been reversed and we\u2019re expecting sometime this year to see it become the norm that there will be that differential back in the French business and that, for example, in that one country, of all those many countries would help drive volume. Other than that, we continue to see the volume increases going on, the take up of myAir is strong and we continue to see that patients in Europe are very interested in getting their own data and using that to help their treatment and help improve their own health outcomes. William Dunlop : Okay. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the questions Will. Operator : Mike Matson from Needham & Company is online with a question. Mike Matson : I guess, I just wanted to start with your manufacturing operations. I think they are pretty much all outside the U.S. One, I want to know if that\u2019s correct, and two, how do you think you\u2019d be affected by some of these border tax proposals that the Republicans are talking about? Robert Douglas : Listen Mike, currently we have a very strong global supply chain footprint that manufactures in many countries and we talk a lot about Singapore and Sydney as being major part to that supply chain. What we don\u2019t often talk about is that we do have manufacturing in the U.S. as well and our motor, ResMed motor technology subsidiary is based in the Los Angeles area. And we also manufacture some in the U.S. in our Atlanta facility. And so we\u2019ve actually got the capability to respond to what is needed on a tax basis, as needed and we'll keep any eye out and be flexible with it. Dave I think you had a comment? Dave Pendarvis : Yeah Mike, its Dave here. Though I think the one thing we can all agree on about U.S. politics today is it's going to be hard to predict. There are a lot of -- there is a lot of discussion about tax reform and what that might mean and we'll just have to wait and see what the actual proposals are, and what the details are, and what gets implemented, when it gets implemented. As Rob said, we\u2019ve got opportunities to do things and frankly, if there become incentives to manufacture more in the U.S., clearly that could be an opportunity for us. We've got a lot of customers in the U.S., a lot of patients in the U.S. But we take care of all of our stakeholders, we look at what we do best for shareholders, what we do best for customers, what we do best for employees and take all those factors into account when we make our decisions. But it\u2019s going to be I think a few years for things to sort themselves out, and we\u2019ll obviously make the best decisions we can on the basis of whatever the details are. Mike Matson : Okay. Thanks. And then just curios for AirMini, I think there is one other product out there that\u2019s big part of that segment of the market. So I was just wondering if you had a feel for how big that market is currently, I guess in the U.S. at least, if not globally? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question Mike. The current travel PAP is a very small niche segment and what our goal at ResMed as the global leader in sleep apnea therapy is to bring the world\u2019s smallest, the world's most comfortable, the world\u2019s quietest and most engaging travel CPAP to the market. And so we think we will actually expand on what is currently a very small travel CPAP niche and create a sizable segment of travel CPAP users that are willing to pay retail cash and work with our home care provides who access those products and really make it as part of their care so that you can have the same experience when you\u2019re traveling around the country, around the world as you do at home. So that\u2019s the goal of the ResMed AirMini and as we launch that between now and June 30, you'll see us talk about how we're going to drive awareness, create that niche and make sure that patients the world over have the opportunity to have ResMed therapy with them wherever they are. Mike Matson : Thanks. Can I squeeze one more in? Just curious if the liquidation of AirStart devices had any kind of material impact on of your U.S. flow generator growth in the quarter. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll hand that over to Jim any thoughts on AirStart? Jim Hollingshead : It is a very small part of sales in the quarter. Not material. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the questions Mike. Operator : Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is online with the question. Suraj Kalia : So, Mick, a couple of questions from my side. First, you just mentioned you're expecting AirMini to be cash-pay for customers, specifically from a travel perspective. Mick, can you give us some idea about how you'll stratify this market in terms of numbers in the U.S.? Just trying to get a sense -- obviously, you guys have a head start here also, how the numbers could play out? That would be one question. And the second question would be how do you all view a potential Tom Price confirmation as HHS had? Our checks obviously are that he's pro DME. Any color from you guys thinking perspective also would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking my questions. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Suraj. I\u2019ll take the second one first and then I\u2019ll hand to Jim maybe to talk a little bit about AirMini and we're looking at segmenting the cash-pay market and working with our provider, customers. But the second part first, Tom Price was a Congressmen from Georgia who spoke at the Mid Trade Conference in Atlanta last fall. And I don\u2019t think anyone in the room knew or thought that he might become HHS Secretary, but when he got off on the floor and made a very passionate speech about the importance of home care, importance of keeping patient's out of hospital, taken well care of in the home. He's an Orthopedic surgeon, I think he understand the economics of the broken sort of sick care system where patients are frequent fliers in the ICU and CCU with COPD and we believe also sleep apnea is a big impact on that. I think he will be a big supporter. And if he puts in place some of the policies that he was advocating for in behalf of the homecare industry as HHS Secretary, we think it could be beneficial for our industry. But look you know as Dave said earlier, there is a lot of things going on in Washington right now, a lot of change and we're going to wait and be ready to hopefully see some more homecare friendly policies out of Washington, but we'll wait till we see them and then we'll act on them. But that sort of the early take on Tom Price, I\u2019d say it's a positive for our industry. Jim, on the AirMini, thoughts? Jim Hollingshead : On the AirMini, we see a couple of opportunities with the AirMini. One for patients and one for HME customers. Patients, we believe have a strong pent up demand for a good travel solution for CPAP. And right now there are some solutions on the market that we think are not up to snuff. We think our offer is going to be very superior and well actually as Mick was saying earlier, we'll grow demand in the category because patients really want to take our full featured CPAP with them when they travel. And so we see an opportunity for patients to have better care and more convenient life with their CPAP as they travel. For customers it's an opportunity because we know that our HME customers, especially in the U.S. are trying to grow their cash-pay business. There is more and more health care spend that's out of pocket in the U.S. because the way insurance is increasingly shifting the landscape. Our DME customers, HME customers are looking for and often exploiting quote, unquote, cash-payer out of pocket opportunities. We intend to take this product through our dealers which will allow them to service patients and that pent up need for a good travel PAP experience and also create a cash-paying opportunities to grow their businesses. Operator : Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is online with the question. Anthony Petrone : Just a couple on underlying device growth in the quarter and it sounded like there's some moving parts there. I'm just wondering if you have the combined contribution for Astral and Nova and ASV. And then maybe just a revisit on underlying sleep margins, where they sit today, just getting all the moving parts with pricing and mix versus Americas or U.S. and masks flow gens? And then one follow up question. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Right, Anthony, well look, the underlying device rate, we don\u2019t split up sleep versus respiratory care and then respiratory care down to ventilation and oxygen. But as you saw in the Americas, a really strong 13% constant currency growth in devices and in EMEA and APAC, very strong 21% with the global 17% growth. We think that growth is strong and sustainable, but there are elements, as we've said earlier with regard to China where there were some things that where sort of onetime and there were other more sustainable parts such as the AirSolutions platform and its ability to continue to drive AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 sales along those lines. But with regard to margins and as we look forward, I think other than the foreign exchange impact, it was pretty reasonably good quarter in terms of margins. Any color there Rob, you'd like to add? Robert Douglas : Well, I think as I said some of the drivers around margins in the sleep have to do with product mix, so while machines grow stronger as the headwinds for margins, sales strong in the U.S. compared to our lower volume markets in Europe and in Asia will generally also be a headwind to margins as well. Offsetting that our efficiency improvements in our supply chain and as we really cranking the production for the AirSense 10 and in other products we see ongoing improvement and it\u2019s a continual headwind to our win rates, so we run neck and neck too. Brett, I don't know if you have any other comments? Brett Sandercock : No, everyone thinks you've articulated it pretty well. I guess we try to take it all into account as best as we can and so we're still looking at the guidance of 58% to 60% and then it\u2019s just contingent on how the product meets geographic mix, FX plays out during the quarter. Anthony Petrone : That's helpful. And then a follow-up would just be, did you quantify the benefit from China and then just any comments on the Cures Act, with that passing, obviously, that pushed out some of the reimbursement cuts, how does that play out? Our checks are suggesting there's sort of one-time payments that DMEs will get at some point in 2017, but that it could be scattered throughout the year. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Right, thanks Anthony, I think somehow you managed to get four questions in there, but we don\u2019t quantify the breakdown there. Rob was talking qualitatively to the curative ResMed China combination and its impact on the quarter, so we're not going to break all that out. Dave do you have any comments with regard to 21st Century Cures and impacts for ResMed? Dave Pendarvis : Sure, so it's really well done by the industry to get this through, you know it's been a long time coming. You remember we were a while back and we were about to have some relief for the rollout of the national expansion of rates and it was stopped by a protest on the floor of the house for gun controls. Just goes to show you, crazy things can happen when you're trying to go through the legislative process. So the industry worked very hard, really across the board and was able to ensure that this time around it stuck and they got some relief, that was six months of relief and there are still some issues with competitive bidding rates and how competitive bidding is determined. But the industry I think on the whole feels good about having gotten a win and feels like, as Mick was saying earlier, that if Congressman Price is confirmed as Secretary of the HSS, there should be at least a sympathetic ear for perhaps some further regulatory relief. And as the industry moves forward you got some stability now. The rates are set with Medicare for the next two years, till January of '19 and Congressman Price has billed to add in binding bids, so that now anyone who bid in an area has to put up a bond, that's a benefit. And so I think the industry is feeling like it\u2019s a better environment with some more predictability and some more stability and that's a positive. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question, Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is online with a question. Saul Hadassin : Maybe first question, Mick, any more color on just what the production issues involved with regards to those SKUs on the masks. In other words, is it a matter of adding more manufacturing lines, for example, or is it just simply putting more product through the existing lines and the demand has maybe caught you by a bit of surprise versus the production capabilities? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks Saul, well yes clearly the market acceptance has been ahead of our expectations and Rob you want to go into some detail with regard to the manufacturing? Robert Douglas : Any new product sold has new tooling and new things to learn about it and really new fine tuning to do on the process and it's really just a matter of mixing that fine tuning and matching that fine turning and process building, plus capacity building, which is predominantly driven by tooling and supply chain management. Matching that with the take up of demand and we should see that sort of match up as we said earlier through the quarter. Saul Hadassin : Great. Thanks. Just a follow-up for Brett maybe. But just on the cash flow from operations, for the half, again, looks like it's reasonably weak versus the PCP. You did flag the inventory build. Should we expect that to recover second half as you start to clear this product that you've been building up, particularly on the mask side for the launch? Brett Sandercock : So, we've had -- I mean -- I think Q2 [ph] cash flow around 120 million was quite good and we just had some sort of modest working capital gain. So that was pretty good. If you look at comparing it to the prior year, I guess we're kind of -- working capital was definitely moving in our favor and we pushed that down quite a bit, so we're generating some big cash flow last year. But I'm still -- Q1 was a little low, it was quite happy with Q2, actually that cash flow ran 120 million, and you might -- we thought new product flow and so that we need to sort of catch up with -- and you might say that you're a little bit, but I still think overall working capital probably just a modest increase that we'll see. Operator : Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is on line with a question. Matthew O'Brien: Just to start with on the core sleep business, by my calculations, and there's a lot of inputs here, looks like it increased, the gross margin increased by about 80 basis points. First of all, is that fair sequentially? And then is that strictly -- it looks like it's mostly manufacturing driven, maybe a little bit of mix on the generator side, but would love to hear your thoughts on that. Brett Sandercock : So, I'm not sure on that. Sequentially -- if you look at this sequentially, we're at Q1 was 58.9 and this quarter was 58.3. I mentioned before unfavorable effects impacts around 40 basis points, a little high then what we expected with kind of deterioration in euro really through the quarter. I mean I guess the rest was pretty benign if you looked at it sequentially. If you look at it year-on-year which is up a tad from 58.1 up to 58.3 --. Mick Farrell : Hey Brett, excluding Brightree. Brett Sandercock : Yes, so excluding that we've got. Yes, I mean the bigger impact there is on product mix and we're still seeing really strong device growth. I think as we go forward and we get some improvements in mask growth with the new products and so on, then you'll see that impact moderate, but at the moment it's still a headwind for us, so that's kind of if you like kind of offsetting this to large extent on the Brightree. And had typical ASP decline and there was FX also year-over-year which was unfavorable, but as we mentioned earlier in manufacturing procurements so on, we've driven that and we've got efficiency there as well, which more than offsets those other elements. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. I'll follow up a little bit offline on that. As far as Inova goes, I think when you bought that about this time last year, you said it would take about 18 months to refine the product, feel more comfortable in rolling that out to your broader sales force. Just based on the comments from earlier in the call, is it fair to say that you're a little bit ahead of schedule and you could be a little more aggressive in rolling that out throughout the course of 2017? Mick Farrell : I\u2019ll take that. Matt, I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much on schedule for that sort of 18 months, I'd get it to, where we think ResMed's quality and functionality should be. Look the Activox product is a great POC. It\u2019s light and very portable. But it can improve in some areas and we\u2019re really working on the improvement of those areas in terms of oxygen delivery and sustainability of that over the many months that they\u2019re out there helping patients get freedom back. And so I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t track and we\u2019re looking forward to gradually ramping that Inova product out there. And as we said in the prepared remarks earlier adding communication capability onto that and pulling it as part of the whole AirSolutions portfolio, we think we\u2019ll allow home care providers to do better fleet management of all these POCs that are out there, but really engage the patients in terms of inherence for the product as well. So the conclusion is, I think we're just pretty much right on track with the versus the timeline that you talk about. Matthew O'Brien: Thank you. Operator : Victor Windeyer from Citi Investment Research is online with a question. Victor Windeyer : Look, my phone dropped out before so if I'm going to be repeating something, I apologize. I just wanted to understand the rest of the world masks and I think, from the questions, you've been saying that supply outstripped demand on this. Can you just confirm that? And why the masks in the rest of the world declined 4% post launch and what we're expecting there. Mick Farrell : Thanks Victor. So I mean, I\u2019m sure, you heard the prepared remarks what we talked about. There are two factors behind EMEA and APAC on the masks. Number one, we had a big comparable, what was about around 8% constant currency growth in the quarter a year ago in EMEA and APAC. So we had some licensing revenue in there and some really good sales to particular customers. And we just launched the N20 and F20 at the ERS. And so it\u2019s the first quarter out there and as you know, you\u2019ve been following our stock for a long time, mask launches in EMEA and APAC, you're talking hundreds of countries and you go country-by-country and thy see the masks, they don\u2019t immediately buy the masks. It can even slowdown the purchases of current masks, because they see the next generation technology and they put it through their systems, they have it as their frontline setup and they work out how to put it into the protocols and starts to get launch through. So as we said earlier, we expect to gradual improvement of masks growth not only in the Americas, but also in EMEA and APAC. Certainly the positive in that region and then through Q3 and Q4, we really think the impact N20 and F20 are going to be there and sustainable throughout fiscal 2018. Victor Windeyer : Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to ask about the sort of pricing and whether there has been a significant return -- end of quarter bulk discounts been away for a while. Has that come back into the market? How are you sort of seeing pricing around [indiscernible]? Mick Farrell : We\u2019re seeing pricing as I said earlier in the pretty steady state these last six to eight quarters. Back to industry standards on year-on-year in terms of price. So the competition is fierce, but it\u2019s around innovation. Who's got the best fit, the best comfort, the quietest device and now best informatic solution to really improve quality of care with patients and provide us to improve their world flow efficiency. Thanks for your questions Victor. Operator : We are now at the one-hour mark. So will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Yeah, thanks. In closing, I want to thank the 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing tens of millions of lives. We remain laser focused on our long term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020, and we look forward to executing on everything we talked about this last 60 minutes and driving this innovation, great products throughout 2017. Thanks for your time today. And we\u2019ll talk to you again in about 90 days. Thanks. Agnes Lee : Thank you everyone for joining us today. If there\u2019s any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investor.resmed.com. Marianna, you may now close the call.

I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth again this quarter, led by sales from Software-as-a-Service businesses as well as our new mask products. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results. I will then outline regional highlights from the business and discuss a few key announcements this quarter. Finally, I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. Let me start out with some timely news. Earlier this week, we announced the much anticipated launch of the world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini. The AirMini is a CPAP solution that is literally small enough to fit inside your pocket. This innovation opens up new channels of cash payment for our homecare provider customers and delivers amazing, compact, quiet, therapeutic comfort to patients. As a CPAP user myself, I have been using a ResMed AirMini prototype in AutoSet mode for the last year or so and it has changed my quality of life as I travel throughout many of the hundred countries where we sell our products and services. I can't wait for this technology to become available to millions of sleep apnea sufferers around the world as we launch the world's smallest CPAP. I'll talk more about this amazing solution later in the call. On the connected care and digital health front, we launched a number of ongoing upgrades of our Brightree and AirView software solutions. Our Software-as-a-Service revenue continues to grow rapidly. Throughout Q3, we have had strong demand for our new range of AirFit masks, including the AirFit N20 in the nasal category and the AirFit F20 in the full face mask category. We have ramped up manufacturing for these products throughout the quarter. And despite continued strong demand, we remain on track to have supply ahead of demand during our current quarter, fiscal Q4. At the bottom line in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-on-year basis. Our diluted EPS was $0.71 on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring appropriate investments in research and development as well as SG&A so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across global markets. Now let me drill down on some regional highlights. The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by SaaS revenue from Brightree as well as solid growth in masks. Device revenue growth this quarter was consistent with the market, and overall patient volume growth is steady. The mask and accessories category grew 8% in the quarter in the Americas. This is up sequentially from Q2, reflecting a strong demand for our new N20 and F20 products. The 97% to 99% fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal of the N20 and F20 are being well received. There's a long way to go on the ramp of these mask products in the quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018. Growth in devices in the Americas was in line with the market, at 3%. That was up against a large year-over-year comparable of 15%. We are maintaining the share we gained during the last 18 to 24 months due to our great devices as well as ongoing homecare provider adoption of AirView solutions and our fast-growing patient engagement app, called myAir. We now have over 3 million patients monitored with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes. We also have more than 5 million patients in AirView and over 45 million patient accounts in Brightree. We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers, patients on a daily basis. We are proud to lead the digital health revolution in sleep apnea and COPD, but we are even more excited by the value that our customers see and how we are reducing costs for therapy setup and enhancing adherence rates for patients, leading to better outcomes. Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model. This quarter, we launched enhanced features integrating document management capabilities between Brightree and AirView. We have a robust pipeline of software-enhancement projects that will add even more features to help make our customers' workflows more automated and efficient, freeing up cash flow for even better patient care. We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms, led by the cloud-connected life-support ventilator called Astral. Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our EMEA and APAC regions. Mask and accessories sales for the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 12% this quarter, driven by the launch of our N20 and F20 products. We continued to received positive feedback in Europe and Asia from patients, physicians, home care providers regarding both the broad fit range as well as the enhanced comfort of the N20 and F20. This quarter, we also achieved solid growth in our AirSense 10 range of devices, as well as our non-invasive ventilators and Adaptive-Servo Ventilation range in Europe and Asia. Adoption of AirView by home care providers and myAir by patients is increasing in Europe as well. We achieved solid growth of our dental mandibular repositioning device called Narval. Our philosophy is however you seek treatment for your sleep apnea, ResMed should be there for you. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 Growth Strategy, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care solutions. We launched our new F20 and N20 in the U.S., Europe and many other major markets around the world in the second quarter. We continue to see exceptionally strong demand for these products that led to demand continuing to outpace supply for some of the SKUs in Q3. Consistent with what we predicted 90 days ago on this call, we expect our supply to catch up with and get ahead of demand during the current quarter, fiscal Q4 2017. As I briefly discussed earlier, we announced the launch of the ResMed AirMini this week. The ResMed AirMini, once again, is the world's smallest CPAP. And, yes, it's also an APAP, with availability of our proprietary AutoSet algorithm. And, yes, it also has built-in humidification with no water that needs to be added each night. In addition, there is an AirMini app that can be used with your iOS or Android smartphone so that patients can continue to stay engaged with their therapy even when they are on the road. You can check out details in our newsroom, at newsroom.resmed.com. The key summary statement is we have created the world's smallest and most portable CPAP that literally fits in your coat pocket. One of the biggest requests for portable CPAP devices is the need for humidification. We have created humidification technology that's integrated into the mask tubing that we call HumidX. This amazing innovation requires no water to be added and provides patients with the humidification and comfort they have learned to expect from ResMed. Our well-established AirSense 10 device range is still the best device for at-home use. Our brand new AirMini just adds to that as the best device for use on the road. We have been conducting controlled product launches in select countries and the feedback from patients and providers on the AirMini has been excellent. We also showed the ResMed AirMini to physicians at the Sleep and Breathing Conference in Marseille, France. The doctors that saw the product there are very excited to add this to their portfolio of sleep apnea solutions for their patients. We will provide more details as we launch the ResMed AirMini over the coming quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018. We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our Growth Strategy. In February, the European research firm, Berg Insight, released their annual Mobile Health, or mHealth and Home Monitoring Report. This report named ResMed as a key global leader in remote patient monitoring, with over 2 million devices connected. We just announced that we are actually well beyond 3 million devices that are 100% cloud connected. As the world's leading tech-driven medical device company, we now have more than 1 billion nights of sleep data. Our digital health apps have been clinically proven to improve patient adherence and our software has demonstrated that it lowers the cost of therapy setup. We are developing and enhancing advanced cloud-based algorithms literally every day to convert big data into actionable information. The goal is clear; we want to lower costs of the health care system and provide better care and better outcome for patients. We are looking at partnerships with other players in digital health to enhance value across disease states, from sleep apnea and COPD to other important chronic diseases. Watch this space. On the clinical front, ResMed sponsored a research study that was presented at the Sleep and Breathing Conference that I mentioned in Marseille. This new study showed that switching patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea from CPAP to ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV technology, significantly improves adherence. This is the largest analysis of patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. The de-identified aggregated data included over 200,000 patients and leveraged our connected care and digital health platforms to run the analyses. In short, the study showed that adherence rates were increased, with a relative improvement in adherence of 22%. These patients also used their ASV therapy longer and had significantly fewer apneas during sleep compared to the control group. This study highlights the need to continuously monitor central sleep apnea and to consider therapeutic options, like ASV, based on each patient's disease severity. Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 Growth Strategy. We are in the early stages of driving our connected care strategy in COPD, and we are making good progress. We have a spectrum of cloud-connected respiratory care products across our portfolio, including cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators in the AirCurve range, cloud-connected life support ventilators, such as Astral. We also have projects on the books for cloud-connected portable oxygen concentrators. With over 200 million patients suffering from COPD and with the disease state being the number-three cause of death and the number-two cause for re-hospitalization in the Western world, we are intently focused on testing and driving models that both lower cost and improve outcomes for COPD, neuromuscular disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and beyond. Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as clinical adjacencies, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This quarter, the CAT-HF Study was published in the Journal of American (sic) [Journal of the American] (15:15) College of Cardiology. This is the first study to show that addressing sleep apnea with ResMed's ASV therapy may improve cardiovascular outcomes for people with preserved ejection fraction heart failure. The overall CAT-HF Study results were neutral, with a pre-specified subgroup analysis showing a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure who also have sleep apnea. Currently, there are no level of evidence 1A guideline recommended therapies specific for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure, which accounts for half of all people living with chronic heart failure. We believe that having the CAT-HF Study published in a major cardiovascular clinical journal is the start of a journey that may prove that ASV therapy can help patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure. Another key area of Horizon 3 growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice. This is an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our SaaS portfolio offerings. Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017, including, of course, the new ResMed AirMini. We continue to pioneer connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep apnea and COPD so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and health care providers. We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted, we had a solid quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $514.2 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Excluding acquisitions and in constant currency terms, organic revenue increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $297.1 million, an increase of 5% of the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific totaled $182.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific increased 9% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $158.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. Revenue in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific device sales were $122.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Masks and other sales were $59.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, or again in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 5% while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the third quarter was $35 million, with growth on a prior-year comparable basis continuing to track in the low-double digits. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring expenses. It the prior-year comparables, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses. We've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the March quarter was 58.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin increased by 100 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices and unfavorable currency movements. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin in Q4 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 gross margin, Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $137.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 16%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and in constant currency terms, our SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.8% compared to the 26.3% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we've updated our guidance on SG&A as a percentage of revenue and expect it to be in the range of 26% to 27% for Q4 FY 2017. R&D expenses for the quarter was $35.1 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 21%. This largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses in constant currency terms increased by 5% over the prior year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.2%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for Q4 FY 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $6.8 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter was $126.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $100.7 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.71, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.62. Note that our prior-year earnings per share comparable was restated as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard (23:04) whereby we recorded a tax benefit of $2.3 million in Q3 FY 2016. In the current quarter under the standard, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.4 million. Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted third quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting an unfavorable impact from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%. And, looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for Q4 FY 2017 will be in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we recognized restructuring expenses of $7.9 million associated with the closure of our Paris manufacturing facility. Cash flow from operations was $67.6 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by an increase in net working capital balances during the quarter, in particular an increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in accounts payable associated with the timing of creditor payments this quarter. It also included the payment of contingent consideration associated with our Curative acquisition and the payment of the BMC/3B litigation settlement. Note these items were accrued in our previous Q2 results. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.6 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $28.5 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior-year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we're still expecting to recommence the buyback sometime in fiscal year 2018. At March 31, we had $1.17 billion in gross debt and $341 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $3.4 billion and net equity was $1.85 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on line with a question. Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our first question is with regards to the current environment for the CPAP treatment adherence, is there any commentary that you could give on the overall market, both at a patient level and just general trends? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Matt. With regards to adherence of patients on therapy, there's been many changes over the years. Traditionally in the peer-reviewed published press in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, adherence rates in the 50% to 60% were published in the literature. Particularly with our connected care and digital health solutions, particularly AirView and, most recently, myAir patient engagement apps, we have now peer-reviewed and published clinical data showing up to 87% adherence when patients are using some of our digitally-enhanced cloud-connected devices and engagement apps, such as myAir. So, there's really a revolution in patient adherence happening through connected care and digital health to get to those 80%, close to 90%, adherence rates. And it changes the game. It's better for patients, it's better for their doctors, it's better for the health care system because the patients who use therapy are less frequent fliers into hospitals. So we think it's good for the overall system. Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's great. And then just kind of general trends in the market. How are you seeing the market growth rates? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: So, Matt, we see the global respiratory medical industry growing in the mid to high-single digits with masks growing at the high end of that and devices growing at the low end of that. And that's where we see it broadly globally. And maybe slightly ahead of that in the U.S. or slightly behind that in Europe, depending on some seasonal and economic factors, but those are the general growth rates, in the sort of mid to high-single digits. Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. Thank you. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions, Matt. Operator : Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is online with a question. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment, Brett, just on the gross margin and the various components that are contributing to that. I guess I'm a little surprised with the guidance for fourth quarter that it is going to be stable on third just because you are getting the benefit of that mix shift. So, what you were anticipating might be coming through to dilute some of that. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Steve. As Mick said, we expect it to be back orders or (29:10) basically supply running ahead of demand and we've got pack (29:15) capacity there. So that comes through in Q4. But then I think there'll be some ramp up by then (29:20) within the market. The other thing I think in the Q4 we'll still be facing some headwinds in things like air freight and so on where we've sort of scrambled to catch up and fill the chain a bit. But that trend moderated a bit into Q4 as well. So just some of those factors are I think that we said looking at short term, we're kind of comfortable where we are. Clearly, we look at mask trajectory. To the extent you get outperformance in mask growth in a relative sense, then certainly that would support improvement in gross margins. So, taking more of a short-term view on the current guidance on that, given a couple of the headwinds around things such as air freight that we'll have to deal with I think through the quarter. But then expect that \u2013 we see that mask growth in there certainly that'll be supportive of the gross margin going forward. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yes. So the air freight cost is going to be enough to offset even in today's quarter result, the mix shift should've been more favorable, I guess. So, are there any other costs other than air freight? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, just think through it a little bit. Certainly, we've seen a big stabilization in product mix compared to what we've seen. But some of the big mix shifts before previously, don't forget, we had device growth which was huge, so we might have had spreads in those growth rates of 20% or 30%. So that really did exaggerate the impact on product mix. So you'll certainly see some benefits with product mix. But you'd need to see quite differentiated growth rates to see sort of massive movements I guess in that product mix. So it will certainly be positive. But you just \u2013 we have to look at the relative growth rates that we get through FY 2018 as we kind of ramp through the new product range and then form a better view after we see true trajectory I think on the new masks. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Andrew Goodsall with UBS is on the line with a question. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to clarify that you are in fact backorder into the fourth quarter. And just another question on the masks. Just when we might expect to see a 20 Series Nasal Pillow? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Andrew. Yes, we were on backorder in a number of the SKUs throughout Q3. As we predicted 90 days ago, we said we would be throughout Q3 and would getting supply ahead of demand in Q4. And we're reiterating that model. We still were on backorder on some of the SKUs at the end of Q3, but we are well on track with the factories ramping up their manufacturing to get supply ahead of demand in this current quarter we are in, Q4. As Brett said, that comes with a cost of some air freight. But we think getting patients this technology needs to happen and we're willing to invest in the temporary air freight to make sure that happens and we can get off the backorder this quarter and get ahead, get our supply ahead and get the supply chain catching up and look for the benefits from that throughout 2018. To your second question with regards to future products. We don't talk about products that are not yet released nor the timing of those. I'm very happy to talk about the product we released or talked about launching this week, the ResMed AirMini. But we won't talk about product pipeline, products that are not yet released. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Sure. And just to my quick follow-up, just on the U.S. tax reform announcements, just any thoughts around repatriation capital? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Well, I might have a first answer to that and hand over to Brett. We think it's good for business if we design a product in Sydney, Australia and manufacture it in Singapore and sell it in France, we don't think we should have extra tax on that money if we want to reinvest it in the United States. And so, we think some of the opportunities to allow companies to invest some of their cash in the U.S. is a good policy potentially. And, obviously, you've got to see that it can get through Congress and actually become law. But if there are some areas of tax relief for us to reinvest funds into, say, our Atlanta manufacturing facility or our Los Angeles, California motor design and manufacturing facilities, and beyond that, our software engineering capabilities in San Diego and Atlanta, Halifax, we would absolutely consider bringing more funds into the U.S. and North America. Brett, anything to add on that? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: No. I think that's a good summary, Mick. I'd just say that I think, that in principle we'd be pretty happy with a repatriation tax. But I think the key would be what sort of rate they attach to that repatriation tax, which would probably be a lot of negotiations, seeing what they come up with. But I think, in principle, we think it's good. It could be an opportunity for us. But, of course, we just have to wait for the detail before I get too excited I think at this stage. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: No problem. Thank you very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is online with a question. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Maybe the first one for Mick, please. Can you talk through the drivers of overall domestic device market growth or demand, how that might vary from quarter to quarter based on product launches? And maybe as you look out, what can ResMed do to bring that domestic device market growth into the mid or high-single digits and over what timeframe that can happen? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Margaret. Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Americas device growth was 3%. Masks was stronger at 8%-plus. And overall growth excluding Brightree was at 5%. So well in that sort of mid to high-single digits in the overall category. Look, one of the catalysts for moving those numbers up, there's many. We're doing a lot of sleep wellness and sleep awareness work with Pegasus Capital and Dr. Oz. You're going to see a number of sleep awareness promotions through our SleepScore Labs' investment with those folks. And a lot of getting out to the 40 million people who are suffering every night and snoring and not getting diagnosed as opposed to the much smaller than that, 5 million, 6 million, 7 million, 8 million who are already on therapy in the U.S. And we'll not just be doing that in this country; we'll be doing it globally on sleep awareness and sleep wellness. The other way that we're looking to drive device growth is obviously by moving our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators. The whole connected care revolution that happened in sleep apnea will happen in COPD, a much more severe disease state. And that will allow us to bring some high-margin device growth in life support vents and non-invasive vents. So, there's some upside in both of those areas. And the third and final area I'd say is taking this idea of this travel CPAP niche and making it a little more mainstream. I think bringing ResMed's technology to something that's the size of the water bottle in front of me. And you can have a look at the videos. We've now released the size of this product. It's about five inches by three inches by two inches. I think having the world's smallest travel CPAP with ResMed's technology and no water added for humidification and ResMed's AutoSet capability will grow that relatively small niche now to be significantly larger and allow ResMed to really drive that category. So those three things are potential catalysts for us to drive up that device number. And I've got to tell you, we plan to do it. Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: And in terms of the timeframe I think was the tail end of the question. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. So, look, all those things are going on in parallel and have different time frames. The sleep awareness is an ongoing one that we're planning over a long-term period. The connected care into COPD, again, is a long-term, you know we call it Horizon 2, Horizon 3 Strategy, but it's incredibly strong on benefits. Reasonably quickly we'll start to see how well the travel CPAP niche grows. And we're starting from a very low base of what's out there already, but we're really excited to play in all three of those. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just as a follow-up maybe to the overall company growth. Can you give us an idea of what the organic Brightree growth was in this quarter? And maybe provide some context about what maybe you've been surprised by about Brightree in the last few months in terms of leverage points, owning the business and really its ability to drive stronger overall company revenue growth into that high-single digit range? Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Sure. Brett, do you want to break out the numbers for the U.S. with and without Brightree and what Brightree's growth was? And then I'll go into some of the more strategic elements of how we're leveraging that. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Yes, as we mentioned on, I think it was really on the Brightree revenue on the third quarter revenue for Brightree was $35 million, tracking quite nicely. And that's tracking low-double digit growth for the Brightree business this quarter. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: In that took, in essence, our Americas growth without Brightree at 5% to Americas growth with Brightree in the double digits really strong 18% top-line growth there in the Americas with Brightree. How are we looking at that strategically? I mean, obviously, we have full separation of the commercial teams on go-to-market on the sales teams on Brightree versus ResMed. But as we look at the broader market, having a SaaS capability to map workflows, reduce the costs of document management, inventory management, physician and prescription management and helping even with revenue cycle management for our customers, has really been an advantage for ResMed, an advantage for the customers, the homecare customers that have partnered with us in allowing efficiencies and freeing up cash flow so they can invest in better patient care. And then tying it to the digital side on the back end where we run AirView and myAir and are able to drive adherence rates from 50%, 60% to 80%, 90%, there's just huge upside in terms of the quality that that homecare provider provides to their customer, the doctor and their customer, insurance company in terms of keeping those patients out of hospital and happy for the doctors and the payers. And also for the patients themselves. And so it's kind of like altruism is linked to the profit motive when you're able to drive adherence up. And we're really excited to be able to do that with our connected care solutions. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Margaret. Operator : Chris Kallos from Morningstar is online with a question. Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question about cardiology. You mentioned the CAT-HF Study and some promising results in the subgroup analysis. What are the next steps in this area? And what can we expect on the clinical trial fronts? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, so we're really excited about the CAT-HF analysis on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Obviously, that study was across both HFrEF and HFpEF. But on the HFpEF side, the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction side, having a statistically significant improvement was very strong. And getting published in JACC we think is a major accomplishment. But it's the start of a longer-term journey, as you know, in this space. We have a number of follow-on clinical analyses that we are going to work on there. Professor Chris O'Connor who was working with Duke and now with Inova Heart Institute in the Washington D.C., Delaware area is absolutely \u2013 and all the \u2013 not just the primary investigators, but all the investigators that are working on CAT-HF are really excited about follow-on work. We're looking at other studies in Western Europe where there's some very similar results, where ASV can have a very good impact on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients. But these are long-term investments. They're not this quarter, next quarter. But over the next year, two, three, we think that that group, which is about half of all heart failure patients, that there's some really good upside in terms of keeping these patients out of hospital with no other pharmacological or device Class 1A guideline therapies. We think that's just an opportunity that we have to pursue, so we're going to be pursuing that over time. And we'll give updates on a periodic basis. Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Great. And perhaps could you give it breakdown of where ASV now stands in the mix? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Well, ASV, we don't break out the category specifically, but I will say, as a general trend, it has absolutely turned around from the nadir, if you like, from SERVE-HF a quarter or two or three ago to strong growth and in line with and ahead of some of the growth of the other categories, particularly in Europe. We've seen the European team really double down on ASV for treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. That study that we did on over 200,000 patients \u2013 think of that, 200,000 patients in a clinical study using the digital health and connected care. That brings two things to bear; not only the use of digital health and connected care for clinical studies that can get published, but also a much larger population base that can show ASV can be better than CPAP for treatment of those types of patients in terms of adherence. So watch this space. There's more to come on combining digital health and clinical studies and looking at therapies like ASV, life support vent and non-invasive vents. Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Great. That's it for me. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is online with a question. William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on cash flow. Your data (44:17) and inventory days both jumped up this quarter sequentially. I'm just wondering if that's a bit of a blip and you expect that to normalize at the end of 4Q? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Will. It's Brett. Yeah, if I look, December was probably compared to our normal quarters, we were in a pretty good position on receivables. If I go back year-on-year and look at it last year, it was pretty consistent on DSOs, for example, on receivables. So I think it's more of December being particularly good rather than March being particularly bad. So I think it's okay there. I think that'll normalize into Q4. And there's just a few other one-time payments were being made through the quarters which pushed our cash flow down a bit lower in March than what you'd typically see. But I do expect that to normalize into Q4. William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. Thanks. And just on the U.S. flow gen growth rate of 3%, do you think you lost market share in the quarter? And, if so, were there any one-offs or any reasons, any contracts perhaps as a result that led to that? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Will. Actually, we think we held share. In fact, the incredible growth of share that we've achieved over the last 18 to 24 months since the launch of AirSense 10 and also Air Solutions and the AirView platform. We took very strong share with strong double-digit growth. But we think the market growth is mid to high-single digits for the whole industry. But flow generator growth is below that mid to high-singles and mask growth is at the high end of it. So we think we held the really strong share that we gained these last four to six quarters. But I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of the Americas. Any further detail with regard to share and holding and growing that? James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Mick. No, I think Mick summed it up really well. Our market data shows that we held our very strong share position in the market in flow gen, which means that in the quarter we grew about in line with market. William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.: Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Will. Operator : Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on that flow gen thought. You called out a tougher comp, but you had a much tougher comp last quarter, still grew over that with the flow gen. Was there something new in the market that would have taken that growth rate down? I think you still have the best solution, but just curious why we saw that change in the growth rate. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, it's really a return to market growth rate there. Which, again, ResMed we don't accept market growth rates; we like to drive ahead of that. Having six to eight quarters of outpacing the market to have a quarter where you're at pace with the market I think is acceptable for a 90-day run. But we don't want to have the adjusted market growth rate forever. And I answered a little earlier with Margaret's question of three areas that we're looking to through getting more patients into the funnel through driving device growth in COPD, neuromuscular disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy for our non-invasive vents and life support vents and POCs. But then also launching the world's smallest CPAP to drive really a cash business through our homecare providers, where we have a retail business from our homecare providers to patients to grow a really exciting niche. 65% of sleep apnea sufferers travel more than four to five times a year in the U.S. And right at the moment, half of them don't take their device because it's too big. I think that whole area is a really exciting one for us to grow. So, look, we don't want to sit back and just accept market growth rates of 3% to 5% or 5% to 7% or 7% to 9% on the various categories. We want to drive well ahead of that. And we have a lot of strategies to do that. We've had a great six to eight quarter run of incredible growth based upon our price strategy of changing the basis of competition from smaller, quieter and more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected. And we're not done with that. And that growth and that share we gained as you saw in the quarter is very sustainable because we're able to have customers get very involved in the workflows of AirView and really want to keep it as part of their business. So we think there's a lot of opportunities to come. And as I said earlier, watch this space as we continue to grow this market. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you for that. And then just one follow up on the P&L. I was just hoping maybe Brett could clarify what is in the other income there? You have $3.5 million. Can you just parse that out? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that predominantly FX, Matt, or FX gains there basically our hedging contracts and so on. So that rolled through other income. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is online with a question. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: J. P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig into a comment that Brett made earlier about on the pricing side of it. It seems like maybe the pressure there has picked up a bit and I just wanted to dig into it. Is it more the mask or the generator side? And is this from competition picking up on pricing, or is it just the DME customers maybe feeling a little more of the competitive bidding squeeze rolling out through this year? Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, J. P. I know I got to tell you, competitive bidding has been in play for seven years now, 28 quarters. And there was no new news in the last 90 days. So we've seen relatively stable pricing within the U.S. geography, and frankly. Also in the other 99 countries we do business in. We haven't seen any major changes to pricing. I'll hand to Jim. Any further color within the U.S. market with regard to pricing effects of CB? James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Well, competitive bidding and the reimbursement environment has been an ongoing challenge for our customers now for several quarters, as I think everybody knows. But there was nothing unusual in the quarter related to pricing. We see about the same annual downward pressure on pricing as we've seen in the category for a long time. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Sure. Thank you. And one more for Brett, if I could. Just on operating cash flows, if you look at it year-to-date, I guess for you guys for the last nine months, it's down probably 32% from where you were last year. It looks like you got more eaten up in inventory and AR. I'm just trying to figure out why that is, especially now that you have Brightree involved. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure, yeah. Last year's cash flow was, if you compare that to the year before, it was very strong cash flows. And we're working through getting some good improvements in working capital balances. So this year I think on the receivable side, we've seen good revenue growth. So that's been driving on the receivables. And working capital \u2013 working balances around inventories and so on just looking to really rebuild through with a lot of new product launches and so on has been happening. So, yeah, I think it's sort of a little bit of a building in working capital level what was a pretty low base I guess the year before. So not too much there. The underlying earnings are pretty strong. It's just a matter of keeping on top of working capital balances really. If we do that, we'll draw some good cash flow. So good cash flow, but acknowledge it's a little bit lower than where we were last year where we had very strong cash flows. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, J. P. Operator : Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just two quick ones. I'm wondering if you could give us some granularity on your oxygen business in the U.S. and how you're progressing towards the capture of the COPD opportunity. Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean. I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead to walk through the market development for our POCs in the U.S. market. And maybe we can talk a little later about where we're going in Europe with that. But I think for this quarter let's focus on the U.S. James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: We think the POC business is off to a solid start in our hands. We've made some solid improvements to that product line. There's an ongoing shift away from canister oxygen to other delivery methods, including especially portable methods, like POCs. So the demand in the market remains strong. And we think that there's tremendous upside in that market as we continue to develop the product, make it a resonant product and bring connectivity to it. So we're very bullish on the outlook for that business. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. And on the COPD and vents, any commentary there, Mick? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, look, clearly, COPD is a huge market development opportunity for us globally. 200 million patients worldwide, many of them in some of our high-growth markets. As we start to grow particularly our China and India business, COPD will be a major play for that. I think in those fast-growing markets to avoid some of the sick care system where COPD patients get really sick and then appear at the hospital on a regular basis within many Western European countries that we're working on keeping them out of hospital with our cloud-connected devices. We can reestablish models of out-of-hospital care for those patients. So in developing markets or fast-growing markets, like China and India, about setting up systems that avoid the current sick care hospital care system in some of the Western world. But then within the Western world, it's about looking at things differently, trying to find ways to use connected care to predict when patients may have exacerbations and have through chronic disease management physician or nurse practitioner contact with a patient to prevent a hospitalization. We think that's a huge opportunity in the long term and something that we're absolutely focused on. And in the short to medium term, we have home health, hospice and home nursing capabilities within Brightree and beyond in the ecosystem which we think can be leveraged to help keep those patients out of the hospital, too. So almost three phases of COPD growth. One in the fast-growing areas of China, India, Eastern Europe developing new models. Two, doubling down on our chronic disease management and connected care play for COPD. And three, some longer-term models to leverage our out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service capabilities. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Great. Thank you, Mick. That's all I have. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean. Operator : David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question. David A. Low - JPMorgan: Thanks very much. Mick, if I could start with the travel CPAP. Clearly, it's just being launched in the coming quarter. But could you talk about how big you think that opportunity could be? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, David. I'll start with this and I'll maybe hand off to Jim because the primary first marketed launch will be in the United States, where there's strong demand for this. ResMed's been in business for 28 years next month. And I've worked at the company for 17 years. And almost every time I've talked to a patient, they've asked me, when is ResMed coming up with a travel CPAP solution? I've seen the stuff out there, but it's not what I want. I want ResMed quality. And we spent a long time making sure we could miniaturize this right and that we could get humidification technology miniaturized and able to be used on the go and we could link it to the world's best masks and housings (56:32). And we got there. And I've been personally using this ResMed AirMini for 12 months and it's totally changed my travel life, whether I'm on a plane, in a hotel. Wherever I am, I get AutoSet, I get humidification and I get my Nasal Pillows, my P10 with me. And so right at the moment, to your question around sizing, it's a small niche. It's sub-1% of the device market niche. We think we can grow it very significant multiples of where it is now. And we think ResMed can have a very strong share in that with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, best connected, best humidified product in the category. Having said all that, we're in controlled product launch. I'm obviously very excited about the opportunity as a patient and a user. But I'm also excited as a business manager for where this could go. Jim, any further thoughts about AirMini and how it can grow the category? James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. I think it's actually difficult to predict how big the market can be based upon the current market. We think that the market is underserved. We know there's pent-up demand. And Mick referred to this earlier; there are millions of patients who are on CPAP therapy. The average CPAP patient, according to our research, takes four trips a year. So there's millions of people who are traveling. Half of them tell us they don't take their CPAP with them because it's too inconvenient. And so that's millions of potential patients who are looking for a solution. But what they're waiting for is a solution that's a ResMed quality solution. And we feel very confident in the AirMini offering. It's not only a terrific, small, in-your-pocket AutoSet, it comes with our best and latest masks with inline waterless humidification, so when you're traveling you don't have to mess around with water. You don't have to worry about finding distilled water and those things that patients have to do. And it's managed. It has a simple on/off button, so it can be managed without anything but an on/off for the patient. But it's also managed and reports out data to an app that is based on our very successful myAir app. And so the patient can look at their own data, can manage their own therapy, et cetera, in that app. So it is a completely next-generation offer from a travel PAP point of view. And as Mick said, one of the most frequent questions I'm asked is, when are you guys coming out with a travel PAP? So we think there's big demand. It's hard to predict, but we're excited about it. David A. Low - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much. And just my other question just on the masks. The 9% growth was a good outcome, given some of the feedback we had about them and the commentary from yourselves that the products were in backorder. Do you have any sense as to what those numbers could have been if you hadn't been on backorder? How big of a drag was the back order on the growth rate? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: It's really difficult to predict exactly what that 9% number could have been if we had had no backorder. I know it would have been above 9%. So it's 10%-plus. Hard to predict exactly what it was because we weren't able to ship those products. I do think it's a huge opportunity for us as we go into Q4 to get supply ahead of demand. You never want to be behind. But of all of the problems to have, it's probably one of the better ones. But we don't even want to have that problem, so we're going to eliminate that here in Q4. And then as we go throughout 2018, we'll be completely supply unconstrained and be able to meet every piece of demand for the N20 and F20. And as I said earlier, we're really excited about the technology InfinitySeal and broad fit range and its capability to get to patients there. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: I think we are now at the 60-minute mark, so I'll probably hand back to Agnes. Oh, okay. I'll just close up. All right. Thanks. So, in closing, I want to thank the more than 5,000 strong ResMed team as they've been diligently driving execution of the N20 and F20 launches and the exciting launch of the ResMed AirMini, as well as our future pipeline of innovative products. Our team continues to demonstrate unwavering commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. I want to thank the global ResMed team. And we're really excited about the future innovations and strategies for what we can do with connected care and digital health for 2025 and beyond. Thank you and we'll talk to you in 90 days. I'm going to hand over to Agnes. Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website, at investor.resmed.com. Mariama, you may now close the call.

Operator : Welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2017 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, Mariama, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. For the call today, I will review top level financial results. I will then review some geographic highlights and discuss a few key announcements this quarter. Finally, I will hand over to Brett who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. We achieved solid high single-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales of our sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems and software solutions. At the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our diluted earnings per share was $0.77. We have passed the one-year mark since the closing of our Brightree acquisition. That acquisition has been a significant success for homecare customers, for patients and for shareholders. This quarter, we acquired new capabilities and technologies to add to our Brightree offering with two tuck-in acquisitions that I will go into further detail on later on in the call. We're making great progress with Brightree as we expand our connected care offering for all of our customers, lowering costs and freeing up cash flow that can be reinvested for even better patient care. I'll discuss more details of our digital health and connected care strategy later in my remarks. We have refined our operating model at ResMed to ensure a direct line from customer insights through upstream marketing through our product and solution development teams and also a direct line back down to the sales interface within each of our vertical businesses. You can think of this as a merging of what were regional sales structures into global business units. We now have a global sleep business vertical, a global respiratory care business vertical and a global Software-as-a-Service business vertical. We have also maintained a direct line from Rob and me to our Asia growth markets business and our Germany healthcare business due to the unique go-to-market models of these two businesses. With this refined operating model, we will not only improve our innovation generation capability, we will also be able to scale more efficiently and provide better SG&A leverage, as we grow towards our 2020 financial and strategic goals. Now, for some geographic highlights of the business. The Americas sales teams achieved solid revenue growth at 8% year-on-year, or 6% excluding Brightree. These results were fueled by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth. Sleep apnea patient volume is growing steadily. We launched the world's smallest CPAP, which is now my favorite business travel companion, called the AirMini. Since its launch around mid-May, the AirMini is achieving good early adoption in its product category of small, second-use, travel-friendly, cash-pay CPAP and APAP devices. I'll talk about AirMini in more detail a little later. Growth in devices in the Americas geography was a solid 8% for the quarter. We continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find value from AirView software and our fast-growing patient engagement app called myAir. We now have over 5 million patients in AirView and over 3 million patients monitored daily with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes. We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms in the U.S., led by the Astral cloud-connected life-support ventilator. The masks and accessories category grew 4% in the Americas geography this quarter. As we noted on our call 90 days ago, we expected to have mask supply constraints throughout the first half of the quarter and to get our manufacturing sufficiently ramped up so that we would be ahead of demand and have supply ahead of demand by June. We did just that. However, we clearly missed out on some perishable mask sales of product in April and May, while the N20 and F20 were in limited availability. Now, we have supply solidified and we can instill importantly full confidence in our sales force that when they make a sale, we can deliver the N20 and F20 products to fulfill that commitment. We are now set to increase sales growth in masks for FY 2018, as we unleash our sales force with these excellent products and full supply. In terms of customer feedback on the N20 and F20, it remains very positive. The 97% plus fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal technology provide a very long runway of growth throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our European and Asia geographies. Device sales in the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 11% this quarter on a constant currency basis. Growth was particularly strong in France, the UK, Japan as well as Australia, New Zealand. It is worth noting that reimbursement for telemonitoring has been approved now in France. This has provided and will provide on an ongoing basis increased adoption of the Air Solutions ecosystem, including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms. Digital health and connected care are going global, and ResMed is a catalyst for that. We have had excellent success with connected care value creation for our U.S. customers these last three-plus years, and we expect to continue that. But now we also expect to provide similar value creation from connected care for our customers in Europe and across Asia Pacific as we expand this offering. We also achieved solid growth in our dental business in Europe with the Narval mandibular repositioning device. Masks and accessories grew at 4% this quarter in combined Europe and Asia geographies. Similar to the U.S. commentary, we expect this growth to expand in FY 2018 based on the positive feedback from patients, physicians and homecare providers. Customers in Europe and Asia are also excited by the broad fit range and enhanced comfort of the AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we're making significant advances with the smallest, the quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care. We launched our new AirTouch full face mask in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. The AirTouch UltraSoft memory foam cushion is a breakthrough in the treatment of sleep apnea. AirTouch is the softest CPAP mask in ResMed's history. It is a significant innovation that is truly novel and very patient-friendly. This mask addresses the number one reason that patients quit CPAP therapy, which is comfort. The UltraSoft memory foam is permeable, allowing heat and moisture to escape without compromising therapy pressure. The AirTouch foam mask cushion also fits into the AirFit F20 frame, giving our homecare customers interchange and switch options as they fit patients and help patients better adhere to CPAP therapy. As we discussed earlier, we started shipping the world's smallest CPAP midway through May. It is still very early days, but we have had excellent initial demand for the AirMini and we are expanding and leading in this new niche product category. There is solid demand for a category of small travel-friendly, second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash. You will hear more from us as we build this category and drive growth with AirMini. We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. This quarter, we announced two tuck-in acquisitions within the Brightree product portfolio that enhance existing Brightree modules and address customer pain points for order intake and opportunities in resupply. The first acquisition of a technology called Conduit Office is the technology behind a Brightree module called MyForms. This technology will allow us to enhance MyForms as a leading documentation and workflow management solution. MyForms provides automation to help improve the order intake process of our homecare customers. The net result is reduced claim denials and improved audit outcomes for our homecare customers. The second tuck-in acquisition is a company called AllCall Connect. This acquisition provides a full-featured live call center for homecare customers who subscribed to Brightree Connect, one of our resupply offerings. It can be expensive and sometimes inefficient for homecare customers to develop their own in-house live calling resupply capability. However, we know from our research that regular CPAP mask and accessory replacement are critical to ensure ongoing patient comfort, fit and adherence to CPAP therapy. AllCall Connect allows us to provide this service to our customers. On the big data to actionable information fronts, a new study was presented at the American Thoracic Society Conference in May. This ResMed-sponsored study of over 130,000 patients on PAP therapy showed that patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, or CSA, are two times more likely to terminate therapy. This study highlights the importance of monitoring patients to support adherence. Also, it shows that early diagnosis of CSA and use of therapy such as ResMed's ASV technology may minimize risk of therapy non-adherence. The de-identified aggregated propensity matched data in the study leverage the more than 1 billion nights of sleep data in our connected care digital health ecosystem. With our new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Carlos Nunez, partnering with global teams of researchers in digital health, we predict that the insights gained from studies like this and beyond will provide the opportunity for ResMed and our partners to advance the field of sleep medicine faster than ever before. Moving to the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators and life-support ventilators continue to grow globally, and we continue to develop our connected care strategy within COPD. The Journal of Global Health estimates that there are over 380 million patients worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. With COPD being the number three cause of death and the number two cause for re-hospitalization, we are focused on testing and driving models that lower costs and improve outcomes for COPD patients. This is an urgent need to address a growing public health crisis. On the clinical front, a study using a combination of home oxygen therapy and home mechanical ventilation, a study known as HOT-HMV was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, or JAMA. This ResMed-sponsored study was presented at the American Thoracic Society in May was previously presented at ERS. The conclusion of the study is that patients who receive non-invasive ventilation at home, in addition to oxygen therapy at home, had a 51% decrease in the risk of re-hospitalization or death. This major finding is now published in a peer-reviewed press and a top tier journal. This is an important milestone. HOT-HMV contributes to a growing body of evidence, supporting the broader use of non-invasive ventilation, such as ResMed's AirCurve 10 platform as an important treatment for patients with COPD. We are excited that we now have our global respiratory care business vertical, including direct line of sight from management down to the sales interface. This augers well for better leverage of studies like HOT-HMV to drive the changes in standard of care and drive further growth of non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator and life support ventilation businesses. Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service business models. We are working with payers and providers to develop and enhance chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination models as well as to acquire and grow Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice verticals. We made progress during the quarter in this area with Brightree's new offering for the home health and hospice market. Our solution called OASIS, which stands for Outcome and Assessment Information Set. This is an integrated software and service solution with Brightree's coding and billing service that helps home health and hospice agencies reduce errors, improve patient care and optimize reimbursement, saving time so that they can focus on patients. This continues to be an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our software offerings. Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about our new product launches this last fiscal year and during the quarter with the N20, the F20, AirTouch full face masks, and world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini. We are well positioned for fiscal year 2018 and we continue to work on a pipeline of new products and connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and other clinical adjacencies. We are positioning the company for long-term growth for 2020 and well beyond, as we refine our operating model, better enabling customer insights to power our product and service solutions teams developments and then drive even better sales execution. We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefits of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks, and we will go to Q&A after that. Over to you, Brett. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted, we had a solid quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $556.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from Brightree, our sales in the Americas were $314 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $206.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $174.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $139.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific device sales were $145.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $61.1 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9% while masks and other increased by 4% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $36.2 million, with growth on a prior-year comparable basis continuing to track in the low double-digits. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP numbers in the current quarter adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles. In the prior-year comparables, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, Brightree onetime deferred revenue fair value adjustment, SERVE-HF accrual release and the cumulative tax benefit associated with the adoption of Accounting Standard ASU 2016-09. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%, consistent on a year-over-year basis. This reflects manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, offset by declines in average selling prices and changes in product mix. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin in fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY 2017 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.9 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% compared to the 25.8% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A growth rates to moderate over the course of fiscal year 2018. As a result, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to improve from around 27% at the beginning of the fiscal year to around 26% by the end of the fiscal year. R&D expenses for the quarter were $36.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6%, consistent with the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2018. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $900,000 over the prior year. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $139.1 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $109.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.77, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.71. Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.03 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impacts from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.8% and for the fiscal year 2017, it was 20%.The current quarter effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $2.2 million (23:03) share-based payment transactions recorded in accordance with Accounting Standard ASU 2016-09. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the vicinity of 22%. Cash flow from operations was $140.3 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and only a modest increase in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.4 million while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $28.2 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, an increase of 6% over the previous quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. However, we expect to recommence our share buyback in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As a minimum, the aim of the buyback will be to offset the dilution impact from employee equity grants. This is estimated to be in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million shares annually. At June 30, we have $1.1 billion in gross debt and $257 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At June 30, total assets were $3.5 billion and net equity was $2 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. This is actually Scott on for Margaret. I wanted to start on the U.S. market growth for both devices and masks. Mick, should we look at device growth on a six-month basis or is underlying device growth accelerating in the U.S.? And then on masks, how do that underlying market growth compare to last quarter and Q4? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Scott. In terms of market growth, look, I think it's always good to look at a 6-month or even 12-month trailing period because there's lots of sort of fluctuations that could happen on a quarterly basis, seasonally adjusted and aspects of how the market might turn. In general, we look at the market as mid to high single-digits growth for the market and devices are at the low end of that range and masks are at the high end of that range. At ResMed, we like to not just meet, but beat market growth rates and I'd say if you look at this quarter completely we beat market growth rates with our device growth, and we're a little behind it on our mask growth rate given some of the supply constraints in the first half of the quarter. But the market growth rate I think it is good to look at a 6 or 12-month trailing period to sort of get a better picture of what the market growth is. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then, Brett, I wanted to ask on gross margin in the quarter and then the puts and takes for that number in terms of currency and mix and pricing and you guys guided to a gross margin for the next fiscal year to be consistent with this quarter. The same kind of question in terms of headwinds and tailwinds concerning you guys have probably had a pretty strong mask growth rate throughout the year. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Well, as you said, Scott, lots of puts and takes on that. But, I guess, the margins if you look at our last few quarters is relatively stable in that sense and we're seeing certainly sort of moderation and that product mix impact is still there, a little bit negative. We had really strong device growth. So, obviously, if device is growing more strongly than mask, then you have a slightly negative impact on margins. But to the extent we see some improvement in that mask growth for FY 2018 then that would certainly be supportive of product mix and supportive of the gross margin. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then lastly for Mick, kind of a bigger picture question on AirMini. Could this potentially be something you push as more of a mainstream product or something you would consider investing DTC advertising dollars towards or are you guys just going to rely on kind of your traditional customers to promote the product themselves? Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Scott. Look, the AirMini is a really exciting product and it's the world's smallest CPAP, but it is designed to be a second-use, cash-pay, travel-friendly device, and that's sort of the niche segment, category, if you like, that it's creating and growing and leading. We've seen great initial demand in the U.S. through our home care channel, as they get the opportunity to enhance their cash sales and in markets around the world where there are other go-to-market models, patients are willing to pay out of pocket. And I think there was some good pent-up demand for a travel-friendly CPAP like this and we look forward to expanding that niche category to a larger niche and continuing to lead it and the AirMini technology is doing a great job now. Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is on line with a question. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Just to re-ask the question, Brett, on gross margin. If the masks are as good as what the feedback suggests, I'm not really sure why we don't really see a meaningful tick up in mask growth and, therefore, why wouldn't we see some upward pressure on gross margin? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Well, really, in that sense, we (29:30) and, I guess, what I'm saying at the moment, it's broadly consistent. We're still seeing some pretty good device growth. Again, we expect to see better growth in masks than what we saw this quarter. And to the extent we see that coming through then I'll update gross margin guidance in a dynamic way. So we'll still continue to update as we go and it's the same story. If we get, say, acceleration in mask then you will see some improvement in gross margin. But we're still doing pretty well in devices also. And year-on-year, we had a few \u2013 if you look at that with the FX and things like that year-on-year, it was a little bit of headwind for us as well. So, there's few things playing out on that but the thesis still hold. If we get good mask growth then you'll see an improvement in product mix and improvement in gross margin. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Sure. Great, Brett, and thanks for taking my question. That's all I have. Appreciate it. Operator : As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have further questions, feel free to re-enter the queue. David Low from JPMorgan is on line with a question. David A. Low - JPMorgan: Thanks very much. If we could just touch on the device growth. As you say, there is a good strong results there. Just wondering if you could give us some sense as the what sort of contribution you saw from the non-invasive ventilation line, if it was that growing strongly and was the AirMini device much of a contributor to that line, please? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Hi, David. It's Mick here. As you know, we don't split out respiratory care device growth versus sleep device growth at this point. But, look, what I can say qualitatively is that the vast majority of that growth was the sleep apnea device growth powered by the AirView software solution and uptake of the great value for physicians and providers from AirView. But that is as we move connected care to our respiratory care platform, that is starting to get some momentum there. I will say that AirMini coming out the gates was relatively minimal on its impact on the aggregate device growth because that niche is really just starting up, but there was some balance between sleep apnea and respiratory care growth, but heavily weighted towards sleep apnea device growth, particularly in the U.S. region in terms of the year-on-year growth rate. David A. Low - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks. And sorry, just a related question. The French change, the telemonitoring, was that meaningful in this quarter or is that something that's likely to become more of a contributor going forward? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, it's more of an ongoing contributor. It will have some influence on product selection by customers as they are looking to make purchases during those 90 days, but that changes \u2013 something that is actually changing the fundamental basis of competition, if you like, in the industry in France and it's an ongoing opportunity for us to drive AirSense, AirCurve, and really the whole Air Solutions ecosystem, particularly the software side of AirView and we're seeing the French physicians really embracing the technology and we're seeing French customers really liking the efficiencies that they can get from the technology. And we're looking forward to patients getting the ability in France to get access to myAir data and at the same levels that the patients throughout the U.S. have these last three or four years and we think the value across that whole ecosystem of customers will be strong. So the short answer is, it's an ongoing thing and it did impact a little bit in the quarter, but it'll be ongoing for FY 2018 and beyond. David A. Low - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator : Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question. Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I would check regarding just the Brightree commentary in terms of growth. If I go back to the 4Q 2016 period and just look at the revenues there, it looks like the implied growth was about 25% this quarter. Can you just clarify whether that was the case and was there any contribution from some of those tuck-in acquisitions you made? Thanks. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Saul, that's rightly said. It was a little bit complicated last year with the fair value adjustments that we had from Brightree around the acquisition and on revenue side. And I see it like it was a slightly shorter quarter. So what I've done in \u2013 what I said for that is really an underlying prudent comparable growth rate. If you look at like-for-like just on the numbers that we've got in our filings, for example, you're exactly right, it's around that 25%. But if you look at it on a pure comparable basis so I would try to (34:20) strip out some of those sort of adjustments then we're looking at that pretty solid low double-digit growth. Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks, Brett. And can I just ask one additional question about the impact of currency for fiscal 2018 on gross margin in terms of the way currency stands at the moment, is there a net benefit coming through this fiscal year based on what the euro has done versus the USD, or is that effectively offset by the rise in the Aussie dollar on the COGS side? Thanks. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, you're right. If I have a look \u2013 just to give you a sense for it, if I look at \u2013 currencies are moving around a lot lately as you'd be aware. But if I look at it going into \u2013 sequentially going into Q1, then I think we get a benefit of some currency for that at the moment, I think we're looking to get a benefit of maybe sort of that 20 to 30 basis points. But then if I take it into Q2 where we then start to pick up some of the impact from the appreciating Aussie dollar, it basically reverses that, so basically roughly 40 basis point reversal. That's a little bit of a tailwind sequentially going in Q1 that then turns into a small headwind into Q2. And then going forward, that should then just sort of flatten out. But if you look at it sequentially that impact is better in Q1, but then a worse impact in Q2 for us. And that's really driven off that pretty sharp increase in the Aussie dollar, which just happened quite recently. And then we'll see where that heads. But at the moment, that's the impacts that we're looking at. Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: That's great. Thanks very much, Brett. Operator : Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on line with a question. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good evening. Can you hear me okay? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: We can hear you fine, Joanne. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Terrific. Two questions. The first one is it's great to hear that you're out of supply constraint on the masks and the accessories or the two new mask items. Can you give us an idea of where do you go from here with full supply? What kind of demand that you're seeing for those products? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think the demand is high and physicians like it because of its broad fit range. Technicians like it because \u2013 most importantly, patients like it. And it has a good first-time fit ratio and a very broad fit range of 97%, one of them 99% on the other. And the InfinitySeal comfort technology just having very light levels of plastic around the bridge of the nose is very comfortable for patients. So, yeah, we missed some perishable sales in the first half of the quarter due to supply constraints. That goes away in Q1, right. As we look forward to FY 2018, our sales force confidence will really be there and I think that's a product that you shouldn't underestimate that when salespeople are in short supply, they don't sell that product line. And when they aren't short-supplied, they can sell that product line. So, as we look forward to FY 2018, we think there will be some very good success of the N20 and F20 and really happy to let that sales team do what they do best, which is provide (37:38) customers in a way that they can help give it to their customers or (37:41) the patients. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Is there a way to quantify those lost perishable sales? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: There are probably 20 different models that we have internally. But it's not something we talk about externally. It's certainly something that \u2013 as we said 90 days ago, we never like to be under supply constraints. With innovation, new technologies, new plastics, new ways of designing single cushion masks that revolutionize the market, we had some challenges with the technology there last quarter. But the good news is we are through that. As we look forward, we're looking to continue growth and particularly growth in masks. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Excellent. And then my second question really is, is operating margins. They compressed year-over-year on higher SG&A. Do you see sort of this new annual run rate as a steady state or should we start moving up from here with the higher mask margins? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, on operating margins, Joanne, yeah, I mean, we've guided to be broadly consistent on the gross margin. We set (38:46) that around how do we get through FY 2018 improving that mask growth and so on, that's going to be supportive for gross margin. Then on the operating margin side, we expect that we'll get some moderation in those SG&A growth rates. Things such as legal costs and so on have been hurting us through FY 2017. As we work through FY 2018, we're focused on driving some operating leverage and we expect to improve that over the course of FY 2018. And to the extent we do that then that will drop through to the bottom line. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: What I'd add to that I think is, as we look to drive operating leverage on a longer-term basis and moderate SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I think we can get more aggressive in how we scale our business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, Joanne, we've refined our operating model with business verticals that include the sales force and downstream marketing teams in region and in countries. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to grow revenue significantly faster than we grow our SG&A as we look forward to 2020 and well beyond. So, short term, I agree with Brett, we got some refinements and great capability to drive operating leverage, but longer term it could be even better. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Terrific. Thank you so much. Operator : Will Dunlop from Bank of America is on line with a question. William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch : Well, thanks very much. Just again wanted to ask about the gross margin and perhaps why you didn't provide a range for the guidance, that guidance seems quite specific even that there is probably quite a bit of variability in the product mix that could occur \u2013 a geographic mix that could occur throughout fiscal 2018. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: You're right, Will. There's always going to be variabilities. There're a number of factors that play out. Obviously, we mentioned a few of them but you've got the interplay of ASP, procurement/manufacturing improvements, FX, product mix, geographic mix, there's a bunch of factors that play out on that, so that is difficult to predict, I guess. But I think broadly consistent. That easily you can see that is being not \u2013 don't think of that as being like purely consistent. But I think you could argue that's a bit of a range anyway around where we're at. So it certainly can be \u2013 and we've talked about it already on improvement in mask and so on conveying that we can get some expansion in gross margin. So I didn't mean that to be a really precise measure of guidance. I think it could range around that 58.2% as well. William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks. And secondly, just on the SG&A as a percentage of sales guided to be declining through fiscal 2018. Is that because you expect litigation costs to roll off? And if not, are they going to be a material component of SG&A for fiscal 2018? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Well, we still have litigation costs and that will still be coming through FY 2018, but we didn't ramp up through FY 2017, I guess, and that was hurting our growth rate on SG&A. We do think \u2013 in terms of litigations, hard to predict exactly where that will end up, but I think it will be not sort of accelerating in terms of our growth from where we were in FY 2017. But we'll continue to be spending money on legal expenses around litigation. But it'll be \u2013 I think it's more broader than that in terms of moderating the SG&A growth rate, so it's not just about legal cost leveling out or going down or whatever that might be. It will be more broad-based than that. And I should say that guidance as well is notwithstanding pretty sharp appreciation in the Australian dollar, which \u2013 we got a lot of operating costs in Australian dollars, so we're going to deal with that as well. So, obviously, that's going to be a little bit of a headwind through FY 2018, but we remain confident that we can moderate the SG&A growth through FY 2018 notwithstanding currency impacts. William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Andrew Goodsall from UBS is on line with a question. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my call. I'm just coming back to (43:10) across the quarter particularly with masks, I know you've belabored this a little bit or were belabored a bit. Just trying to sort of understand when the back order came off and when we look at that mask number, we're sort of looking at really a sort of one-month effect of kind of full availability and, I guess, just trying to understand the exit rate to give us some confidence around 2018? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Andrew. So, as I said, we were supply constrained through well beyond halfway through the quarter. So you can sort of look at it as, yes, (43:38) four to five weeks of the supply constrains starting to go away SKU by SKU and us getting supply ahead of demand. I think the fact that I talked a little bit to earlier, Joanne's question with regard to sales force having full confidence that they're going to have supply, that's not binary. You don't just go Monday morning and say we got full supply and the sales force say it's fantastic, I'm going to go and sell a truckload of F20s. I think what it takes is some time and they make some small orders and make sure it comes through and then ramp up because intelligent sales people with very good relationships with their customers and they want to fulfill those relationships with when they make a sale that we can deliver the order. I think what we've shown in the last four-plus weeks in the quarter is that we were able to deliver on all those sales. And so I think the exit rate from Q4 was very strong from our team in terms of what we're able to provide to customers for N20 and F20. And I expect that to continue very strongly in Q1 and throughout FY 2018, as we are completely supplying non-constrained and the sales force can be really out there driving the full bag of products that ResMed has for our customers, which is a really strong portfolio right now. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. That's great to hear that exit rate. Then I guess maybe without answering my own question, I guess, just obviously the UltraSoft does have a pretty intense replenishment schedule or monthly (45:05) I guess it's fair to say no real effect of that in this quarter, I mean, that sounds like it's sort of a next quarter event? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, the AirTouch range with the foam masks does have a faster replacement cycle. It's incredibly comfortable. Heat and moisture can be removed, but air pressure stays high, but it does have a fast replacement cycle. Yeah, I mean, we've really started launching that mid-May and so you've got very little, if any, replacement cycles on the AirTouch. And that whole category of a foam mask with a different replacement cycle in terms of comfort is really a category that we're developing over time. I don't know, Jim, the Head of our Sleep business and running the Americas last quarter, you want to give any further insights to AirTouch? James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, I think we're confident on all three masks. The F20 and the N20 are both on great trajectories and now that we're off supply constraint, we're very confident in forward growth and in Q1 and throughout the year. AirTouch would start later, launch later. It's getting fantastic reviews from both physicians and patients. And, again, you're absolutely right. We're not yet really into it didn't launch early enough for us to see any real impact of resupply on the cushions in the quarter. Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: That's great. Thank you very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is on line with a question. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Hi. Just a question on Brightree. We haven't had an update in the gross margin of that business since you first acquired it and I just wonder how that might look today particularly in light of some of the acquisitions that you've made. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure, Steve. It's Brett. Yeah, I mean, look, it's pretty consistent with those that we disclosed at the time we made the acquisition. So there's really no material difference on those margins. We got a couple \u2013 these are kind of like small tuck-in acquisitions, I guess. They're sort of not enough to move in any significant way the operating margins of Brightree so they've been pretty consistent through that period since acquisition. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Okay. And then just with the R&D guidance, that looks like it's stepping up a bit in 2018. Is there anything you can talk to on the R&D front that might be driving that other than currency? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Well, currency is pretty big one. So, I mean, the two things is we'll continue to invest in R&D, so we're going to continue to do that. So we'll continue to grow our investment base. And the second one that's probably hurting us a bit on that, on the guidance or \u2013 basically I'm looking at 7% to 8% is really the uptick, I'm looking at this Aussie dollar, a lot of our R&D is still (48:06) in the Australian dollars. So that's (48:10) if I look at the forecast, that's hurt us a bit on the R&D \u2013 just in R&D in terms of the U.S. dollars. So those two factors have led us to guide around that 7% to 8% mark for FY 2018. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Okay. And then just one other. Could you just give a bit more color around the effective tax rate? It's just even without the change around the Accounting Standard, it looks a lot lower than what I was expecting. Yeah, if you could just address that, that will be great. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Overall for the year, Steve \u2013 the quarter's a bit hard because anything you do in terms of the year-end calculation of tax, everything gets sort of trued up (48:55) gets concentrated into the last quarter. But if you look at full year, we're around 20%, and that was probably helped a little bit by the ASU 2016-09 Accounting Standard. So that sort of contributed a little bit there. Perhaps underlying it's more like 21% or something like that. So that's sort of where we landed at an underlying rate. If we look at it going forward, it's just I'd up-tick (49:18) that a little bit but just looking forward around the geographic distribution of taxable income is the fact our (49:26) stronger Australian dollar is going to be a factor on that, at least also contributing a little bit. And there're a few other things, such as the R&D tax concession in Australia, which is capped at $100 million, has reduced from 40% to 38.5%. So, a number of those factors that's sort of playing out on the tax rate and has led us to increase that just a little bit from where we were in FY 2017. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Great. Well, can I just ask one more? Just the other income line that reverses from a profit to a loss. Was that just hedging, or was there anything else in there? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that's predominantly FX losses through hedging. Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: All right. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Victor Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question. Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research : Yeah. Thanks very much. Look, I just wanted to ask about the portable oxygen concentrator business. (50:28) is that hasn't sort of grown, been a little disappointing. But what's your take on where that business is going and how you can really drive growth there, little pockets of opportunity? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Vic, I'll hand that to Rob Douglas to talk about POCs. Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Victor. Victor, we've continued to work hard on the Activox product and we've actually made a number of improvements under the hood, so to say, of the device. And we've seen a lot of improved performance. And we think our teams have done a great job on that improved performance, and now we're just getting that through to the customer base. But we're not re-branding yet. We're still waiting for further improvements that we think and we're happy with the device as \u2013 when ResMed puts its brand on it. So today, we're still work in progress, we're making very good progress. The Activox unit remains a very good, very long battery life device, and our teams are promoting it appropriately to key customers. So we're in it for the long haul and we believe it's going to be a very good business. Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research : Okay. And then do you think, in terms of a ResMed branded product, you're well down the path in terms of development of that, Rob, or is that something (51:54)? Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Victor, one of the things we've learned over the years is we really can't forecast our R&D program, it's just too good for competitors and everyone like that, so we're really reluctant to give you a timeline and details on that. Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research : Yeah. Okay. And does this form part of this new \u2013 it sounds like you're sort of doing a slight reorganization in terms of the operations with the new business verticals. Is this presumably this falls into the respiratory care part of that business, is that right? Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Victor, we've got a very strong respiratory care team that's able to focus on getting at and treating patients with respiratory insufficiency, the COPD is one of the main patient conditions that we're aiming to treat. We've got an improving and an emerging portfolio of treatment options there. We'll be building more of them. As Mick mentioned earlier, we've really generated lines of business where we've got much closer engagement between our sales organization and our customers back through to our R&D teams. We should, over time, see benefits on the R&D programs for that. Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research : Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one I wanted to ask was just about the acquisitions and other tuck-ins, but could you help us understand whether there was any contribution in the quarter and what you're expecting from those in terms of contribution in the next fiscal year? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Matt. No, there was de minimis contributions in Q4 from those tuck-in acquisitions. They were really about technologies that will enhance our ongoing future growth of the Brightree offering. So, to maintain and grow that double-digit growth of high-margin business in Software-as-a-Service, we're finding tuck-ins of some good technologies can really help enhance that growth and drive further value for our customers. So, AllCall Connect, I met the team, they're actually with me up in Halifax with our Healthcare Informatics team, straight after the acquisition already engaged with our software development teams and really starting to say, well, how do we link this tuck-in technology with all the great offerings we currently have on Brightree and continue to provide that value as we go forward. So, the short answer is no contribution Q4 2017. We'll expect great contributions as that capability of AllCall and Conduit Office roll into the offerings from Brightree, some particular modules that will expand over FY 2018, FY 2019 and beyond. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just a question on leverage. If I look at the guidance quite literally, it would imply slight negative leverage in fiscal 2018. I know you have a headwind from foreign exchange, but what are the other headwinds that you have that maybe we're not thinking about and how can you get more leverage out of the business as you continue to grow the top line? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Matt, look, it's a great question and clearly we are looking for operating leverage. And you can't control things like FX and those just have to be budgeted where they are now. Well, where they will be, who knows, but we will see as those move. But the things you can control, your SG&A growth, your R&D growth, your investments across your portfolio and how you go to market. As I said in the prepared remarks, establishing these new business verticals, rolling sales into global businesses, we think there is a lot of efficiency we can gain here in how we grow revenues significantly faster than growing SG&A while providing the same or even better value to customers. So it's something that we are laser-focused on in terms of operating leverage, getting SG&A leverage and driving that growth. We're not going to grind our R&D dollars and not invest in innovation, I mean, that's something we're going to continue to invest at a very strong rate. Brett put that sort of 7% plus guidance in there and FX might tick that up to 8%. But SG&A can come down from 27% to 26% and below, because there are great ways to scale marketing through social media and digital marketing. There are great ways to scale our sales force and how we go to market in different countries. And so we've got a lot of very exciting plans for the next fiscal year and beyond, in terms of driving our go-to-market strategy that I very strongly believe will drive better operating and SG&A particularly leverage as we grow forward. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on line with a question. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Two quick ones for me. Maybe just on masks, generally just an update on the pricing environment overall and as you get up to speed with some of the new offerings out of the supply issues, do you expect, perhaps, a little bit of premium pricing on the newer offerings? And then maybe, just an update on inventory cycles, receivables, cash, it looks like inventories ticked up a bit as well and just trying to reconcile that with the supply constraints? Thanks, again. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the questions, Anthony. I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim Hollingshead to talk about pricing and the second part to Brett. James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, Mick. Hey, Anthony, thanks for the question. What we're seeing is a pretty normal pricing environment relative to historical. And so, we're not seeing any unusual declines in pricing. We're seeing the same steady, moderate annual ASP declines that we generally see historically in the industry. All of our mask offerings are priced at a premium. We're the market leader. We're the strongest provider in the industry and we have premium pricing. The new mask themselves also are at a premium to the, well, with the existing portfolio. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : That's helpful. Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. And then, Anthony, just on the inventory, some uptick there, but we definitely rebuilding through the supply chain to support the new product introductions and to get us into that good strong supply position. So an element of that is building for that and you see that reflected at June 30 in the inventory balances. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions, Anthony. Operator : Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is on line with a question. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. So, Mick, two questions from my side, first on Brightree, can you quantify the OUS or ex-U.S. opportunity for us? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Suraj. Yeah, Brightree has been laser-focused on the U.S. HME industry and has an emerging vertical that they're building in home health and hospice. And so, we think the value provided is incredible there. The skill sets, so none of the existing modules, if you like, from Brightree would be copied and pasted into our German business or to our French business. But the capabilities of running a Software-as-a-Service business, getting strong annually recurring revenue, monthly recurring revenue from customers, having them pay for the software per user per month is a very strong capability. So, we think that out of hospital Software-as-a-Service capability is an incredible strength that ResMed now has, and we are looking to, as I said in the prepared remarks, expanding home nursing and expanding home health and expanding hospice within the U.S. environment. We're also looking to expand our Software-as-a-Service offerings in France and Germany, and the UK, probably not with the direct copy and paste, it's more of a longer-term approach than that. Some things that we are looking to copy and paste and in fact have already started to do that are in the area of the Air Solutions ecosystem, including AirView and myAir. So the AirView software for physicians and for homecare providers has already been set up with service based in Europe, according to European law or with European security protocols and in line with the needs of our European customers, so AirView is going there. In addition, myAir, the patient app, that's universal, right. Humans are the same no matter where they are. And just translating it into French or into German or into Japanese is the pathway and making sure that we have all the right engagements around local law and security and so on. So, that's where the scale is in AirView and myAir and then the capability longer-term with regard to Brightree. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. And, Mick, one last question, this might be a na\u00efve question, Mick. So let's say I have to order a resupply or reorder a mask, whether a full face nasal or what may be and let's say that N20 and F20 is not available, what happens to that patient? I guess, I'm just trying to understand if there were supply issues, did those patients stick with their existing masks? Did they go to the N10 or F10 in the interim or if you can just help us reconcile because I'm looking at the 4% Americas mask number. Part of me is like, that the patients \u2013 are they waiting for these new masks to come online or did they switch to N10 and F10? Any color would be great. Thank you for taking my questions. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Suraj, that's a really good question and one thing that we talked about internally when we saw supply constraints was focusing to make sure that we had resupply for customers versus going after a new patient sale. And so, as I said, there were some perishable sales lost in the first half of the quarter of some new patients that we wouldn't have got on to a ResMed mask and the customer will make a choice whether they went to an N10 or F10 or to a competitor's mask, and losing six weeks or eight weeks of first (01:02:15) is a bad thing to do. But what's worse is, to your point, not being able to resupply an existing customer. And so we've really worked with our homecare customers to make sure that any resupply needs from \u2013 and the mask had only been out there six to nine months and so it wasn't a huge population resupply but that the supply was focused on resupply of patients who had already loved the N20 and F20, so that we continue to have those patients. Really our homecare customers continue to have those patient supply with ResMed masks for their life and so that was a nuance during the quarter. I'd see we're just past the bottom of the hour and so we should probably end the Q&A there, Mariama. Operator : Okay. Thank you. We are now at the one-hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And I guess, I could handle this myself. But thanks Mariama. In closing, I want to thank the now more than 6,000 strong ResMed team, here at ResMed (01:03:14) diligently driving execution of N20, F20, AirTouch and many new launches as well as the future pipeline, and even more innovative products and software solutions that we will launch as we move ahead. Our team continues to demonstrate unwavering commitment to changing the lives of tens of millions of patients globally. And we remain laser-focused on our goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. We'll talk to you again in 90 days with our Q1, FY 2018 results. Thank you for your time. Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, again, for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website on investor.resmed.com. Mariama, you may now close the call.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Mariama, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders that joining us today as we review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results. I will then cover some business highlights and discuss some key announcements this quarter. Then I will hand the call over to Brett Sandercock, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. We are very grateful to our global team for a very strong performance this quarter. We achieved double-digits global revenue growth led by sales of our software solutions, our mask systems and our sleep apnea devices. At the bottom line, we grew operating profit 12% and our diluted earnings per share was $0.66 on a non-GAAP basis. We are proud of this solid top and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team. Brightree\u2019s growth continues to be strong at 15% year-on-year inclusive of tuck-in acquisitions. We are making great progress as we expand our connected care offerings for all of our customers creating efficiencies and improving patient outcomes. Now let me cover some geographic business highlights. The U.S., Canada and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth at 11%. These results were fueled by strong growth in devices and masks as well continued double-digit software sales growth. Sleep apnea patient volume continues to grow steadily. Growth in devices in these countries was 8% for the quarter. It has been over three years since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions cloud-based software and we continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find ongoing sustainable value from our connected care solutions. The masks and accessories category grew 13% in the U.S., Canada and Latin America countries this quarter. We've seen good demand across all mask categories. The AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20 masks are performing well and we are able to fully supply the fast growing demand for these products. Our brand new AirTouch F20 is in its very early days and has high patients comfort ratings right out of the gate. Device sales in the combined European and Asian countries were up a very strong 9% this quarter on a constant currency basis. ResMed France achieved very strong device growth catalyzed by the announcement of increased reimbursement for telemonitored sleep devices relative to non-cloud connected devices. We expect to continue our connected care value creation for our customers across Europe and Asia Pacific as we expand digital help and connected care globally. Across Europe and Asia, our teams achieved strong mask growth of 15% this quarter. We expect ongoing growth based on continued adoption of our recent mask technology and positive customer feedback across the spectrum : patients, physicians and homecare providers. I\u2019ll now take a few minutes to update you on our three horizons 2020 growth strategy and then I will hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products enhanced by digital health and connected care. We now have over six million patients monitored with AirView software and over four million patients monitored with 100% cloud connected medical devices on their bedside tables. In addition, we have seen over 1,300 new patients\u2019 signup for the myAir patient engagement app every single day. It turns out consumers love seeing their own data. We are expanding globally with our connected care solutions translating the value creation that we have brought to our customers in the U.S. over to France and across Europe and beyond. In September, we featured our recently launched travel CPAP solutions, the ResMed AirMini at the European Respiratory Society Conference in Milan. There continues to be the demand and interest for a category of small travel-friendly second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash. We are focused on growing this category all around the world with particular success in existing cash pay markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada and the UK. This quarter ResMed and Brightree launched another integration solution. Together, we provide a seamless solution for all homecare providers through automated resupply enrollment for patients managed by both Brightree Connect and AirView software. With this enhancement, AirView automatically alerts Brightree Connect once the patient has achieved compliance criteria. So that the patients can be automatically enrolled into the Brightree Connect resupply program. This feature helps our homecare customers to ensure that every sleep apnea patient is getting the supplies that they need in order to have the best possible therapy experience while saving the customer labor costs through software automation. This enhancement is the latest in a growing list of time saving features for our customers that maximize both the patient benefits as well as homecare provider benefits. Brightree also launched ConnectPRO at the Medtrade Industry Conference just earlier this week. ConnectPRO is a comprehensive solution that combines all technology services and data analytics that are necessary for our homecare customers to efficiently manage resupply workflows and to improve patients' resupply engagement. Our connected care strategy is also having a positive impact on the clinical front with ongoing publication of studies. The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine known more simply as The Blue Journal published a study run jointly by ResMed and Kaiser Permanente, which reported that remote monitoring improve the patient adherence to sleep apnea therapy. The key takeaway from the study was that telemonitoring of sleep apnea patients with ResMed's algorithms resulted in an increase of therapy adherence of 22% to 37%. This is statistically significant and also clinically significant data. We look forward to more publications using ResMed's database of the identified aggregated data. We are transforming big data of more than 1 billion nights of sleep metrics into actionable information that can improve clinical outcomes. Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy. Our cloud connected non-invasive ventilators and light support ventilators continue to grow globally and we are building our connected care strategy for COPD. We relaunched our portable oxygen concentrator called Activox with improved quality and performance at our U.S., Canada and Latin America Sales Conference during the quarter. We expect steady growth of Activox throughout the year and beyond. Watch this space for future enhancements of our connected COPD offering. We are driving awareness of key clinical studies that have shown improvements in COPD mortality and reductions in COPD hospitalizations such as our home oxygen therapy, home mechanical ventilation study called HOT-HMV. Our market access teams are working to change the standard of care for COPD in key countries around the world to drive future growth in non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator usage and life support ventilation businesses to serve COPD patients. Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management models and out-of-hospital software businesses. This quarter Brightree announced the appointment of Robert Dean as General Manager of our home health and hospice business within Brightree. This continues to be a very exciting area for us with lots of long term growth potential. We are expanding out-of-hospital software offerings as we continue to grow and acquire software-as-a-service businesses for home health, home nursing and other alternative care settings. We\u2019ve had a tremendous start to the fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow revenue throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond. We are encouraged by the success of our new product launches with the AirFit N20, the AirFit F20, the AirTouch F20 and the ResMed AirMini. We continue to work on a pipeline of new products and enhanced connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and other critical chronic diseases. We have positioned the company for long-term top and bottom line growth for 2020 as we continue to execute our strategy and action, drive operating excellence and pioneer market leading connected care solutions. We have improved our 12 million lives over the last 12 months and we continue to pursue the holy grail of health care improving patients\u2019 quality of life, slowing chronic disease progression and reducing overall health care system costs. With that I will now turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great, thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $523.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%. Taking a closer look at geographic distribution excluding revenue for Brightree, our sales in the Americas were $296.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $189 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 11% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas device sales were $157.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $128.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 9%. Masks and other sales were $60.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 14% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the first quarter was $38.1 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. The Brightree results include two small acquisitions we made in our fourth quarter of FY 2017. On an organic basis, Brightree revenue for the quarter grew by 13%. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles. And in the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, and the Astral battery field safety notification expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Now, I\u2019ll turn to rest of the P&L. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 58.4%, lowering our prior year non-GAAP margin predominantly due to ASP declines. On a sequential basis, we saw an increase in gross margin reflecting favorable foreign currency movements and improved product mix from stronger masks sales. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q1 FY 2018 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $143.9 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.5% compared to the 27.7% that we reported last year. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A growth rates to moderate over the course of fiscal year 2018. As a result, we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to progressively improve and to be approximately 26% of revenue by the end of the fiscal year. R&D expenses for the quarter were $37.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or, on a constant currency basis, an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 7.4% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2018. Moving further down the P&L. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.8 million for the quarter, consistent with the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $124.3 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $94.1 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.66, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60. Additionally, foreign exchange movements positively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro largely offset by the stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 22%. Cash flow from operations was $94 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $29.6 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of $49.7 million and repaid $60 million of our outstanding debt. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. And as previously announced we expect to recommence our share buyback in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As a minimum, the aim of the buyback will be to offset the dilution impact from employee equity grants. This is estimated to be in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million shares annually. At September 30, we have $1 billion in gross debt and $208 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.5 billion, and net equity was $2 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital Markets is online with a question. Joanne Wuensch : Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? Mick Farrell : Got you loud and clear, Joanne. Joanne Wuensch : Excellent, very nice quarter. I have two questions. The first one has to do with adoption of the ResMed AirMini. You are talking about adoption in certain geographies that are more comfortable paying out-of-pocket and I noticed the United States wasn't on the list. Can you discuss how \u2013 which regions are more willing to get into [indiscernible] with wonderful product and why not United States? Mick Farrell : Sure, Joanne. I\u2019ll start and have a go then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead, the Present of our Sleep Business to talk about how we're expanding our AirMini business. Firstly, I'm a personal user of the ResMed AirMini and have been for many months. And I traveled all around the world with it and just in love with it as my new travel companion; literally anywhere I go around the planet it follows me. So that I get my great sleep apnea kit without having to get distilled water at Tokyo at 2\u2019o clock in the morning when I land from the direct flight from San Diego. The adoption of AirMini in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore and the U.K. where we have established cash pay channels has been very strong in fact far above our early expectations. Patients are really loving paying out-of-pocket for something that has provided such great care. But I\u2019d say in our business to business to consumer markets like the U.S. where we sell to our homecare providers and then they sell cash to patients. It's been a slower ramp up as those customers start to ramp up their cash businesses with all the changes of competitive bidding in the U.S. landscape change, our homecare providers in the U.S. are loving to build their cash businesses and it's something they've been working on strategically for a number of years. And we think the ResMed AirMini along with portable oxygen concentrators is a great opportunity for them and we\u2019re supporting them in both of that. But with that introduction to it, Jim anything further to add for the U.S. or beyond? Jim Hollingshead : Yeah, thanks, Mick. I would just add that sales of the AirMini in the U.S. are actually going very well. I think that the comparison intended to Mick\u2019s comments is about on a sort of per patient basis you know where the relative volume of AirMini against the AirSense 10 platform. So the U.S. market, AirMini is performing as expected. We think it's launching well \u2013 really well. It will ramp. We\u2019re in a B2B2C model in the U.S. because we're selling it through our channel partners as Mick just spelled out and we see those volumes growing very nicely. It's in the markets where patients are having to pay cash for an AirSense 10 or they choose an AirMini where we're seeing on a proportional basis AirMini is being purchased more frequently. Joanne Wuensch : And as my follow up question, you spoke about patient volumes for sleep apnea patients being somewhat strong, which is quite the opposite of what we're seeing in other pockets of med tech utilization. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in patient volumes and how you\u2019re measuring that? Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks for your follow up, Joanne. We don\u2019t go into the details of patient volume growth within geographies. What I can say and the difference maybe between us and other parts of med tech is \u2013 this is a very personal experience of suffocation before therapy and then the experience of getting that gift the breath and the life change that can happen with sleep apnea. And taking the U.S. geography with somewhere between 40 million to 60 million Americans suffocating every night and maybe we have six or seven million so far diagnosed and on treatment. We still have 85, 80 plus \u2013 85% plus of the opportunity in front of us. So I think that a large pool of undiagnosed patients provides a regular flow into the sleep labs and into the homecare providers that allows for that sort of steady growth of patients into the channel. We've got a long way to go on that journey. And if you go to other geographies around the world, Western Europe, 85%, 90% of the opportunities still in front in terms of sufferers and getting them through the system. And in our Asia growth markets, the opportunity is above 95%, 98%, 99% in some of the geographies. So we think we\u2019re in mile one of a marathon here and we're really excited about that, patient volume growth continuing to grow steadily not just in this quarter, but throughout the fiscal year that we expect ahead and beyond. Operator : Thank you. David Stanton from CLSA is online with a question. David Stanton : Thanks very much and thank you for taking my question. I had a question about replenishment of mask. And I know that you\u2019ve rolled out a new replenishment systems through Brightree. Can you give us some kind of idea about what kind of replenishment growth rates particularly in the U.S. that would be greatly appreciated? Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yeah, thanks, Dave. That's a good question. Clearly through ResMed Resupply which is part of the AirView software solutions package and part of Brightree Connect as we talked about linking on the backend with AirView. We are really working very closely with our homecare providers to make sure that every patient, who wants the mask and is qualified for a mask has the opportunity to get one. As I\u2019m saying earlier I am a personal user of this therapy and you need to change this mask. It's a piece of plastic that touches your face every day and stays on it hopefully for seven hours of sleep every night and even with regular washing and regular drawing the mask needs replacement. And we think there's a lot of opportunity. We know there's a lot of opportunity to work with patients and empower them with the information that they have to be able to access the supplies that they need. So without going specifically into numbers, we can tell you that qualitatively the pool of installed base of customers, patients who are using masks and want to resupply them is increasing quite strongly. And it's a large part of our mask and accessories category. David Stanton : Thank you. And then I guess my follow-up would be, would it be fair to say that replenishment masks are growing as strong or less strong than new masks? Mick Farrell : So, David, we probably don't want to go into the specifics of each category of masks, the installed base and new patient flow and how quickly they\u2019re growing. But if you think about it from sort of a mathematics point of view as the installed base grows larger and larger and we work on replenishment protocols with patients and expand them, there's some linear opportunities with new patient setup and some exponential opportunities with replenishment as you engage the patients throughout the world in all sorts of different models. David Stanton : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Steve Wheen from JPMorgan is online with a question. I apologize Steve Wheen is from Evans and Partners. Steve Wheen : Yes, hello. Can you hear me? Mick Farrell : Got you loud and clear, Steve. And I am glad we\u2019ve got your company right too. Steve Wheen : No, no, that other one. Anyway I just had a question just on the revenue for mask. Obviously, a very nice step-up in mask growth and it follows the fourth quarter where there was a bit of hiatus just because of capacity. Is this an unusual growth rate that we\u2019re seeing in this quarter in terms of catch up and therefore it might moderate going forward? Or how do you see the appetite for these new masks, now that there is no restrictions oversupply. Mick Farrell : Yeah, Steve, as we have talked about 90 days ago, we did 90 days ago still have some supply constraints that we were just leaving at the end of Q4 throughout Q1 we were supply unconstrained. And we were able to meet and beat the very fast demand as you saw for masks throughout the world. And if you look at the masks and accessories category, it grew at 13% on a constant currency basis in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and it grew at 15% on a constant currency basis in Europe and Asian countries. Look, we think that that we can continue to grow masks all the way throughout the fiscal year. There were all sorts of different changes that happen in terms of comparables from quarter X and quarter Y as you go through out of fiscal year. But as you think about the next twelve months and twenty four months, we think the runway of the F20, the AirFit F20, the AirFit N20, so the full phase and the nasal components are very strong. And we're just out of the gate with the AirTouch F20, which is our brand new technology which incorporates both the LSR, or liquid silicon rubber, but also foam technology. And it's early days, but patients are really loving that opportunity. And so we're working with our channel partners on the business side of it. But in terms of patient acceptance, we\u2019re seeing some really good patient acceptance. So having said all that, I think we've got a really good runway ahead for growth throughout fiscal 2018 for our masks. I don't think it's a catch up. I think it's the start of a steady growth pattern that we should see throughout fiscal 2018, 2019 and beyond. Steve Wheen : Great. And then just on life follow up question. On the SG&A side, I wonder if Brett you might be able to give us some color as to the major drivers of that tailing off as a percentage of revenue by the end of the year. What's driving that? Is it legal costs related? Yes, if you could just give us some color as to what the major \u2013 what\u2019s underpinning that? Brett Sandercock : ,: Steve Wheen : So there would be specifically a reduction in legal costs within that number. Brett Sandercock : I not let that, I mean, you can\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s a difficult one to predict. I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019d say you kind of \u2013 it builds more, let\u2019s say builds more into the run rate so to speak. Steve Wheen : Yeah, sure. Thank you. Operator : David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question. David Low : Thanks very much. Could I just start with Brett your comment with when you talk on gross margins about some ASP pressure, let\u2019s see if you could talk a little bit anything in particular that showing up in this quarter that [indiscernible] different from what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Brett Sandercock : I mean not particularly, David, we \u2013 you see every year in and year out. You see ASP the content impacting your gross margin. So I guess it\u2019s just to call out of the main impact on gross margin year-on-year. If I look at it sequentially, it looked actually pretty good and we\u2019re quite pleased with that uptick there on the margin. So, no, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s adjusting unusually met and it\u2019s kind of more typical with what we experienced in terms of SSP declines. David Low : Okay, great, thanks. And if I could just touch on the oxygen concentrator, the Activox, could you talk a little bit about where you think that product is positioned versus the competition? It\u2019s been a fast growing space. You see something that now becomes a material contributor quite quickly or is that something that\u2019s slightly to grow gradually over time? Mick Farrell : Look, yeah, David, as I said in the prepared remarks, we just relaunched with the quality and new capability in systems around our Activox system as we\u2019ve now incorporated that acquisition of Inova into our business and relaunched it really with our sales team this quarter. I will hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to maybe provide some further detail on our POC business. Rob Douglas : Sure, David. We described some of the quality improvements that\u2019s really under the hood quality improvement. So, we\u2019re very happy with those quality improvements and how they\u2019re going and our customers let\u2019s say use the product will start to experience those improvements. The product positioned us very portable. It's got the longest battery life. It\u2019s very light weight. It\u2019s a good performer. And we see steady take up of it. And we\u2019re patient with this product and we're going to make sure it has really the ResMed quality, and provides really good treatment to patients and we\u2019ll build on that. David Low : Thanks. Operator : Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question. Margaret Kaczor : Good morning Brett. Good afternoon everyone else. First question for me is on the generator growth this quarter, which remained quite strong in the Americas. So maybe you guys can give us a little bit more detail around what's driving the strength. You've been keeping in this high single-digit range. Is it existing accounts increasing their mix of the resonate platform, given all of the new software offerings, just underlying patient volume? Any additional color would be great. Thanks. Brett Sandercock : Thanks for the question Margaret. And yes, we did see strong growth in Q1. If you take the U.S., Canada Latin America countries combined we saw 8% constant currency growth in Q1, and across the Europe and Asia countries, we saw 9% constant currency growth. Look, we think the total market is growing in that mid-to-high single digits across the sleep market with devices sort of more towards the mid-single digits and masks toward the high-single digits. Implying in Q1 that we did take share within the device and mask categories, and we believe that to be true. Of course, we don't go into detail around that. But some of the reasons behind that are certainly all boats are floating on the strong patient growth that we talked about earlier, but we are taking share. And I think the share is as you've seen now, it's 36 months since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions platform. And it's really a solution when you combine it together. We've published data now in the peer-reviewed press that shows that we can reduce labor costs for our home care provider customers by up to 59%. So when you have a system that can lower labor cost for your customers by 59%, it can really help them to start to say not only will I try this device and try this software, but I'll double down on it, and I\u2019ll continue to invest in it. And we're seeing a lot of customers garner a lot of profit growth for themselves that they didn't take that cash and reinvest in the business for better patient care. So we think this is really a win for ResMed. Obviously, as you see in these numbers. It's a win for our home care customers that use ResMed, and it's a win for the patients because they get better care. They engage daily sometimes with their myAir app and check out their myAir score and their adherence rates move from 50%, 60% historically in this industry up to 87% in one of our published studies and beyond that in some of our unpublished work. So we think it is sustainable, strong value proposition with our customers that's driving it, Margaret. Margaret Kaczor : Great. And then on the breakthrough side as a follow-up. That one is chugging along as well, you\u2019ve got this low to mid-teens, and I know some of that is the acquisitions, but how should we think about acquisitions being off for the rest of the Brightree installed base? Can those be material to your growth? And then just as you think about that underlying growth, is it new accounts? Or again those existing accounts just choosing and selecting more new offerings that you have? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. So another good question, Margaret. Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Brightree growth was 13% constant currency if you didn't include any of the tuck-in acquisitions, and it's 15% constant currency, including the modest tuck-in acquisitions that we did throughout the year AllCall and so on into Brightree. Look, yes, solid, low to mid-teen growth in our software-as-a-service business. We think that some of that is new accounts. Our sales team at Brightree is excellent. [Audio Gap] and I and a bunch of the team, Raj went out there to Atlanta to spend time with the team and in a leadership program and looking at those top not just sales but development leaders and how they're teaming up and really adapting the ResMed culture but keeping a strong Brightree software-as-a-service culture and driving a really strong commercial performance. And so we think that's sustainable, taking into account share but also growing users within existing accounts. We find that the HME providers who partnered with Brightree grow, and as they grow, they get more users. And software-as-a-service system users is paid on a per basis. So you can grow by getting new accounts. You can also grow by helping new customers grow. So we're doing both. Margaret Kaczor : Great thanks. Operator : Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question. Sean Laaman : Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Just back on Activox, Mick. I'm just wondering if you can give us a bit more granularity on sort of specifically the relaunch and what you might have changed from what you're doing before to what you're doing with the relaunch, that would be really good. Mick Farrell : Yes I\u2019ll hand it over to Rob. Rob Douglas : Yes, Sean. As I said before, we \u2013 ResMed's position in the markets are very high-tech, high-quality value and innovation. As we got our early experience with the Activox, we saw a number of improvements that we wanted to make, and we made those improvements. I described them earlier as improvements under the hood. So they're really \u2013 they're not features, but they're improving the delivery of the existing features. And as I say we progressively incremented them in a sequential basis, and then we really looking to the absolute measure, which is our customers' response to those to see how we go \u2013 to see to really put the metrics around the quality improvements and what extra value that adds. And I can't really get granular on the exact next steps of improvements that we're coming up simply because we don't forecast our R&D programs for competitive reasons, but I would say we've got a very strong team working on it. We've got some great ideas. We still got the feature that we have talked about, about adding some of our connected care capability into the system, which we believe will further improve the quality of delivery of oxygen treatment of patients but also improve the ability of our HME customers to manage those patients and those fleets of devices that they need to. And that's all work in progress. Sean Laaman : Thanks Rob, thanks Mick. And may be just a quick follow-up for Bret. Are you able to give us a sense of what currency you might be thinking going forward for the euro and the Aussie? Brett Sandercock : [Indiscernible] this morning they changed for me already, but when I was looking at that we're sort of \u2013 we were being forecasting around that sort of $0.78 to $0.79 of the U.S. and around $1.18 on the euro, euro U.S. they're moving around quite a bit of volatility. So yes, on that one, Sean, but that's sort of what we're using as being current rates at the time we looked at it a few days ago. Sean Laaman : Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you everybody. Operator : Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is online with a question. Saul Hadassin : Thanks. Good morning guys. Brett, can I start with a quick question on gross margin just to clarify or confirm your comments regarding the outlook for gross margin of the remainder of fiscal 2018. Did you say it should be consistent with 1Q 2018 as a result? Brett Sandercock : Yes, I said broadly consistent. Saul Hadassin : And I just wonder if you can give us some of the contributing points to that considering the mix seems to be improving on the mask side and just cognitive of what currency is doing. But is there anything else presumably, you've got some efficiencies coming through manufacturing so what's maybe offsetting the incremental improvement in gross margin over the fiscal year? Brett Sandercock : Sure. We saw \u2013 well, and I'll just we did see some incremental improvement from Q4 and Q1. And we did see certainly you can see some improvement in product mix, and that's been a turnaround for us. And the expectation is that will be more a tailwind for us as opposed to a headwind over the last few years that\u2019s positive on that. And there's number of factors playing out on ASP decline, FX, manufacturing procurement efficiencies, and so on, which we do expect to get over the course of the year. But the product mix and how we're looking, I guess, the portfolio a little more diversified now as well. So that plays into looking at predict on gross margin as well. So I think all in the mix. I guess the other thing I would say is that stronger Aussie on a sequential basis kind of hurt us going into Q2 and essentially a factor that in as well. So that would be headwind for us going sequentially selects inclusive of that. So some of the other underlying trends I think are there in a positive but there could be few going against us, particularly on the FX next quarter. But broadly consistent, I guess, what we're saying is we're comfortable with that margin around where it's at, and we're seeing good growth across both devices and mask, which I think is really showing the strength of the business and a good diversified portfolio. So I think it's going to \u2013 with that sales growth and good gross profit dollars, and I think that's in good shape for us going forward. Saul Hadassin : Thanks Brett. That\u2019s all I had. Operator : Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks for taking my questions. Just in the U.S. instant card consolidation with DMEs over the last few years. Just try and give us a sense of what you seem pressure on prices, I guess, the business under the hands of larger buyers. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question Andrew. Clearly, over the last three, to five years, there has been some consolidation in our U.S. home care provider base, still around 5000-plus home medical equipment providers in the U.S. So quite a large and diverse group of local mom-and-pop, regionals as well as national players, and we partner with people across that spectrum. As I look at the market, I think we see a relative sampling of changes in reimbursement, some of those big step changes that happen in the early phases of the U.S. government CMS program to get in line with our private payers and now we have a sort of steady program going forward. And I think a pretty broad view at CMS that actually investing in sleep apnea care reduces long-term costs for the government, and we're certainly as I said on the AdvaMed Board of Directors, we definitely spend time in Washington letting Washington know that medical devices as an industry is able to lower long-term costs by keeping patients, particularly in sleep apnea and in COPD, out of hospital and under better care. So we're seeing a pretty steady reimbursement environment. It does have reductions, but they're reasonably steady. So I think we're able to weather that and work with our home care providers to make sure that they use Brightree and they use AirView, and they can lower their labor cost by 50%, 60%, and that's the way to free up cash to reinvest in marketing to primary care doctors and going after the 40 million, 50 million, 60 million people who are suffocating. And as yet haven't had a chance to get diagnosed, get treated and get a better quality of life. Andrew Goodsall : And Rob may be just to you as my follow-up question. I guess just in terms of your proposition, which is, I guess, potentially higher price mask relative to some of the competition, but I guess a bit of a longer-term recurring revenue line. I\u2019m just trying to understand how that's going with the better sales propositions going with the DMEs in terms of them taking through the benefits of that program versus perhaps just going for margin or sorry, low pricing to increase margin initially. Mick Farrell : Yes thanks Andrew. I\u2019ll handle that follow-up to Jim Hollingshead, our President of Global Sleep business. Jim Hollingshead : Andrew I think on your first question we still see consolidation in the market, but it's nothing of out trend right. I mean, there's been no unusual change in consolidation in the U.S. market as Mick said remains very fragments where you get right down to it, right? 5,500 roughly providers of sleep. What we're seeing is that HME customers more and more are realizing how important it is to them and their business to resupply patients. And so we have seen the scheme up a little bit earlier the call. We have an on ongoing increase in adoption of resupply platforms. And our offerings, especially through Brightree, have made that a lot easier for our customers. And so as they adopt those more automated approaches to resupply, they're able to grow that side of their business. Andrew Goodsall : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question. Matt Taylor : Hi thanks for taking the question. Can you hear that? Brett Sandercock : Got you loud and clear Matt. Matt Taylor : Great. So Brett, I did have one follow-up on the gross margin. You had talked in the past about mix being the biggest factor. So I was still a little bit surprised that we didn't see more of a lift this quarter. Can you just talk about the rest of the year, what you're expecting from effect on gross margin? And is it mainly the Aussie dollar that's holding it back from being better with this better mix? Brett Sandercock : Sure, Matt. I mean, I guess, you should have asked that back a little while, I guess you've got to put a little bit of context a few years ago when we're seeing what you are experiencing like huge growth rates in devices. So we're talking 30%, 40%, almost 50%. So the differential between the device growth and mask growth was very substantial back then. So that did have a bit of impact on product mix. So we're still seeing that impact, but obviously, can be more modest when differential is perhaps more like 5%. So I mean, part of it is, if you like, the resilience and the strength of the device that we're seeing, which is a very good thing. So therefore, the thing. So therefore, the product mix, I guess, is more modest than what you might have seen two years ago, which makes sense. And the other thing I'd add to that is if you looked at you go back to FY\u201914, masks were probably something like, matching other categories something like 46% of our revenue. You fast-forward to today is about 38%. So there has kind of been that kind of overall change in our mix as well. So that plays into it as well. But \u2013 so it's still there the trends there the improved product mix is there, but it's on a more modest scale than what you might have seen when devices were growing really strongly back in FY\u201915. Matt Taylor : Thanks. And your continued device growth a couple of years after the AirSense launch has been impressive. And I guess, I was wondering if you thought you continue to grow at kind of above-market rates with just the base AirSense. And if you could comment on how material you think of oxygen concentrators and the Mini can be. Brett Sandercock : Yes that\u2019s a great question Matt. I\u2019ll turn try with that. Look, if you think about it, the portfolio of devices we have is a lot broader now. Brett's talking about the change of connected care and our sort of leadership in connected care, not only within our vertical, sleep apnea, COPD, but across the med tech sector has launched us to the No. 1 position in devices in flow generators, and that's a large ballast in the boat to Brett's point much higher percentage of our portfolio. So GM percentage lines move less strongly although gross profit dollars and net operating profit as you saw this quarter growing at 12% year-on-year in OP is really solid growth and that's free cash flow. And we invest free cash flow cash back into our business. We don't invest percentages back into our business, and so we manage on the growth of that. But our continued device growth will expand, and I think you can add on sort of strong, steady maintenance and growth of share. But more importantly growth of patients into the funnel to keep device growth strong and steady. And as you said, there's upside as you add on to ResMed AirMini, which is brand-new category. It's cash pay. It's a second use, it's travel path, and it's sold direct in some markets. It's sold through our great home care provider customers in the U.S. and many European countries, and we think that's good addition. As you said, there's portable oxygen concentrators, and there's also our growing COPD play in noninvasive ventilation and life-support ventilation, and we have now cloud connected both of those, the NIV. So our AirCurve 10 range and our Astral devices both now have cloud connectivity. We're in the early days of driving our connected COPD strategy, but that's a very high-cost disease state. It\u2019s The number three killer in the world, COPD. And it's the number two cause for rehospitalization. So we think as we look forward to 2020 and beyond, there's a lot of opportunity to have steady and growing device growth as we look forward to the longer term Matt Taylor : Thanks. Operator : Victor Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question. Unidentified Analyst : Yes hi, it\u2019s [indiscernible]. I just wanted to ask a bit more about the COPD and also as it relates to the device growth overall. So just as we look forward, do you think RSA itself can continue to grow mid-single digits? And then the COPD part of them, if you like, is on top of device growth given we're relatively early in the journey there? Or how does that sort of play out long term? And then all also perhaps you could talk to where do you think we are in terms of capturing the value out of the noninvasive vent side, you talked about Europe side. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Victor [ph]. The answer is yes. I mean, I think the sleep apnea market as we said earlier is growing in mid-to-high single digits with the devices more in that mid-single-digit range. I think we can continue to hold and grow share in the device side that will allow us to grow the sleep apnea business and that mid-single digits in the device category. And in addition to the ResMed AirMini, which is on top of that as a cash pay and the POCs, which is on top of that, there are the noninvasive ventilator devices. Where we're at on that is the early stages. There are 400 million, 500 million patients worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive preliminary disease or lung disease. Many of them remain undiagnosed or undertreated. Many of them need to get first initial drug therapy, and they need oxygen therapy and then they need non-invasive ventilation therapy. And then as their disease progresses towards more chronic care, they need life-support ventilation therapy. And so ResMed plans to be walking with those COPD patients along that channel. So this is a longer-term development. It's sort of part of our 2020 and even our 2020 strategies. We're starting to put that together and developing our connected COPD strategy, and we'll be doing that with partners across med tech and pharma and beyond. And so watch this space for longer-term growth there, but we're really excited about the growth in our core business of sleep apnea and our second Horizon of growth in COPD and our third Horizon of growth in out-of-hospital software. And if you put them all together, I think you've got a very strong and dynamic portfolio. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the cash pay at kind of CPAP side that it seems that\u2019s going better in the market ofAustralia in stage? Is that cannibalizing mainly in cash pay market with us cannibalizing sales? Or how much is there [indiscernible]? Mick Farrell : Yes I\u2019ll hand that to Rob. Rob Douglas : So our view of the market whole new segment, and so it's contributing to growth. And when a person buys an AirMini to travel in addition to their home sleep app, that's really good for them and to sell that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had. So we see a very strongly contributing to growth. As Jim said earlier in some of the cash pay markets, there are some people will say actually I will not use that, it\u2019s my premium one. We\u2019re okay with that either way. But really on as a whole in most of the markets AirMini is really a strong contributor. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is online with a question. Anthony Petrone : Good afternoon good morning thank you for taking the question. Maybe make a little bit on rising tide carrying all boats here Philips put up a pretty good print as well high single digit growth. So many a little bit more on is it a reimbursement thing that that benefiting everyone in the marketplace? Is it another dynamic that whether it's in a DME channel or again you also mentioned reimbursement coverage in France. Just trying to get maybe why this quarter's a little bit different from an underlying funnel/volume perspective. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Anthony. Yes, look, I think there is some rising tide there, and that's a global mid-single digits to high-single digits market growth. And so other players are going in that mid- to high single digit range as well. As I said earlier, I do think we're taking share with connected care. You mentioned France. There is four levels of reimbursement for sleep apnea therapy that starts from January 1 in France. And the highest is telemonitored patients with adherence over 4 hours and telemonitored patients with two to four hours and then below that non-telemonitored patients, and so on. And ResMed's been leading in connected care not just in the U.S. but globally, and we've been preparing for this type of a change, and we're really excited that the government of France has recognized that they get a return on investment by telemonitoring patients, increasing adherence and taking those patients out of hospital. So we think this market is great and growing and good for all players, but we think it's particularly good for people who are looking at ways to take cost out of that channel and partner with their customers, which include the home care providers but also the patients like giving them their own data every day patients use their devices more. I mean, adherence rates of 87% is unheard of in our industry, and we're publishing that and getting it in the peer-reviewed press in the Blue Journal, Jama, Lancet and you're going to see more from us on that. We have one billion nights of sleep data in the identified aggregated data, and we're going to be putting clinical studies out there to show this therapy, sleep apnea therapy is very beneficial, and we'll be doing the same in COPD as we move forward. Anthony Petrone : Great and then just a follow-up would be just a bit on working capital once again, just on year-over-year basis. AARs ticked up quite a bit as inventory. I'm just wondering is there reason to hold more inventory? Is there an elongated sales cycle in the same on the credit sales? And is there an elongated cycle there as well? Thanks. Mick Farrell : So I\u2019ll handle the question to Brett. Brett Sandercock : Thanks Mick. Thanks Anthony Petrone. On the data side, [indiscernible] I think is still within kind of our range that we would expect and fairly typically historically, and it's probably still may be allow us maybe 12 months ago but still comfortable with where we are on that. On the inventory front, you're right. We're up a little on the inventory, but it's been pretty well documented. We're a little bit supply constrained on masks and so on. So some of that is kind of a rebuild into getting that right. So you see that's kind of manifested in the inventory a little bit as well. That's all the way through the supply chain. So we're now in much better shape, but I guess that's reflected in some inventory build. And then going forward, I'd expect not necessarily come down, but I'd expect sort of the growth with moderate as we kind of balance a bit better now. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Mariama. In closing, I want to thank the more than 6,000-strong ResMed team for their execution on our new product launches. This quarter, that hard work has translated into market share gains, revenue growth and double-digit 12% net operating profit growth. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, including patients, physicians, payers and providers. We will talk to you again in 90 days. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. This concludes ResMed\u2019s first quarter of fiscal year 2018 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners David Stanton - CLSA David Bailey - Macquarie Matt Taylor - Barclays Vic Windeyer - Citi Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities Tom Godfrey - UBS Operator : Welcome to the Q2 Fiscal Year 2018 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin. Agnes Lee : Thank you, Christine, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, litigation, tax outlook, and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all our shareholders joining us today as we review our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results, business highlights, and key announcements this quarter. Then I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. We are very grateful to our global team for another quarter of strong performance. We achieved double-digit revenue and double-digit profit growth, led by sales of our software, solutions, mask systems, and sleep apnea devices. At the bottom line, we're starting to see leverage from ongoing operating excellence initiatives, with net operating profit growth of 20%. We see more runway ahead for operating excellence as we move forward. Our diluted earnings per share were $1 on a non-GAAP basis. We're very proud of this strong top-line and bottom line performance from our Global ResMed team. Growth in our Brightree software-as-a-service business continues to be strong at 14% growth year-on-year and we're pleased with the continued innovation and execution by the Brightree team. Turning to our global therapy businesses, we continue to build our digital health leadership and we now have well over 1.5 billion nights of medical sleep and medical respiratory care data. We continue to unlock significant value for our customers from these data, creating efficiencies for providers, simplifying workflow, and care delivery for physicians, and improving outcomes for patients and their caregivers and loved ones. During the quarter, the U.S. Government passed tax reform through Congress moving to a territorial tax system. This has liberated our global cash assets to be able to be invested without artificial constraints. We will now be free to invest in three new ways : one, growing upon our existing strong U.S. manufacturing footprint; two, growing our existing U.S. based research and development capability; and three, building upon our existing valuable U.S. based intellectual property assets. We will provide updates on all these areas as we move forward. Now for some geographic business highlights. The U.S., Canada, and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth of 12% on a constant currency basis. These results were fueled by strong growth of devices and masks, as well as continued strong double-digit software sales growth. Sleep apnea patient volume continues to grow steadily through our marketing efforts and those of our channel partners. Growth in devices for the U.S., Canada, and Latin America was 12% for the quarter on a constant currency basis. It has been three-and-half years since we launched the AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software platform. We continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians choose ResMed, because of the sustainable value proposition of our connected health and digital health solutions. The mask and accessories category grew 12% in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America markets this quarter. We have seen good demand across all mask categories. In the nasal and full face categories the AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20 respectively are doing very well. We continue to expand production to meet the growing demand for these products. Our newest mask technology, including memory foam capability, in the AirTouch F20 is receiving high patient comfort writings and is creating a new market niche for patients with the high sensitivity to therapy, a previously unmet, or at least under met market need. Revenue across Europe, Asia, and other markets grew at 8% in the quarter on a constant currency basis. Mask sales across these markets grew at a very strong 16%, reflecting strong adoption of our F20 and N20 mask products. Device sales grew steadily at 5% this quarter across Europe, Asia, and other markets. ResMed France has continued to drive solid device growth, catalyzed by increased reimbursement for telemonitoring of sleep devices relative to non-cloud connected devices, a change which went into effect January 1, 2018. We're excited to highlight France as the first country to recognize the value of connected health by establishing a reimbursement system change that drives the market to a new world of efficiency and better patient outcomes. We're working with other governments and payers on similar initiatives, over the coming period just watch this space. I'll now take a few minutes to update you on each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth which focuses on our sleep apnea business we're making significant advances with the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected health solutions. We have begun to leverage the well over 1.5 billion nights of actionable medical sleep and respiratory care data in clinical studies and to provide insights that improved patient care and health care delivery efficiencies. We have over 6 million patients monitored in our cloud-based AirView system and over 4 million patients monitored with 100% cloud connected medical devices in their homes. We also continue to grow patient engagement. We have over 1,300 new patients who sign up for the My Air Patient Engagement app every day. We see My Air enrolment continue to rise exponentially, patient engagement is working. The bottom-line is people love seeing their data and when they do, they engage with their therapy more and more. With continued global adoption of Air Solutions, the AirSense 10, the AirMini, the N20, and the F20, these masks provide world leading fit, seal, and comfort. We see a future of solid ongoing revenue growth in this space across that portfolio. This quarter ResMed announced the integration of AirMini data with AirView our cloud-based remote monitoring patient platform. The connectivity between AirMini and AirView enables physicians and homecare providers to see patient's nightly data verified here and spot any therapy issues that need to be addressed. This gives physicians a great opportunity to educate and engage patients to reach the best possible healthcare outcomes even on their brand new travel device. We continue to show progress on the clinical importance of treating sleep apnea. The American Journal of Medicine published a ResMed sponsored study during the quarter including over 5,000 hospitalized patients. The study showed that diagnosing and treating sleep apnea in the hospital improved these patients' long-term survival rates. Undiagnosed sleep apnea is highly prevalent among hospital patients and there is an opportunity to simply and efficiently diagnose them in the hospital and ensure that they received life changing therapy post discharge. Following pathways like this will not only reduce costs for the healthcare system, it will also increase survival rates and quality of life for the patient. It is great to have more proof that we are not only saving money for the healthcare system, our therapy is also saving lives. Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy, our cloud connected non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators form the basis upon which we are building our connected health and digital health capability for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. With over 380 million COPD patients worldwide and with COPD being the third leading cause of death and the second leading cause for rehospitalisation, we know that we can provide value for payers, providers, physicians, and most importantly, patients from these data. In San Francisco, a few weeks ago we announced Mobi, the first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator. Mobi offers excellent oxygen output and battery life and a great balance of mobility, comfort, and therapeutic quality to the many millions of people who rely on supplemental oxygen. We expect steady growth in this POC category throughout the year and we have plans for continued enhancements for ResMed's oxygen concentrator pipeline. Mobi forms a critical path of our spectrum of respiratory care products, along with cloud connected non-invasive ventilators like the AirCurve, high flow therapy, and our cloud connected life support ventilator called Astral. Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management tools, and out-of-hospital software business expansion opportunities. This quarter our Brightree team announced integration alerting to improved reporting for home health and hospice businesses. The seamless transfer of data between Brightree and the post-acute care data analytics company called Strategic Healthcare Programs allows home health agencies to immediate receive accurate reports to help improve patient care and compliance. Out-of-hospital software continues to be an exciting growth area for us, with strong long-term growth potential ahead. On the consumer and wellness side, our joint venture SleepScore Labs launched its latest and greatest non-wearable sleep improvement system for consumers called SleepScore Max. This product is powered by ResMed's non-contact sensor technology for best-in-class respiratory and sleep architecture analysis. At the CES Conference in Las Vegas, SleepScore Labs announced a partnership with Williams-Sonoma to offer what they call the Robin Sleep System which is a combination of the SleepScore Max product and a Williams-Sonoma Mattress Set. This will be at their online stores and select brick-and-mortar stores. For ResMed, this sleep awareness partnership provides a pathway to inform the 50 to 70 million Americans who suffocate every night but do not yet know that they need to seek diagnosis and treatment for their sleep apnea. You will continue to hear more from us on the sleep awareness front as we move forward. We've had two strong quarters to start our fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow revenues throughout the second half of fiscal year 2018 and beyond. We are also well positioned to continue to grow our operating profit as we execute on our ongoing operating excellence initiatives. We have seen success with new masks and new device products including the AirFit N20, the AirFit F20, the AirTouch F20, and the ResMed AirMini. Most recently, we are excited about our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator called Mobi. We are positioning the company for long-term top and bottom line growth for 2020, as we continue to execute on our strategy and action, implement operating excellence initiatives, and lead the Medtech field to unlock value with connected health as well as digital health solutions. We have changed well over 12 million lives over the last 12 months and we continue to drive what we call our triple aim in the out-of-hospital healthcare market. One, improving the quality of life for patients; two, slowing chronic disease progression; and three, reducing overall healthcare system costs. With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great, thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As Mick noted, we had a very strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was $601.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree software-as-a-service business, our sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $329.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets totaled $233.4 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada, and Latin Americas device sales were $173.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $155.5 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets device sales were $163.3 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 5%. Masks and other sales were $70.1 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 16% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9%, while masks and other increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the second quarter was $38.7 million, an increase of 14% on the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and tax-related charges associated with the recently enacted U.S. Tax reforms. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses associated with additional contingent consideration, restructuring expenses, and litigation settlement expenses. We will provide a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the December quarter was 58.2% compared with 58.3% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Consistent with our comments last quarter, on a sequential basis our gross margin in Q2 was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency movements. Assuming current exchange rates, and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for the balance of fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q2 FY18 gross margin. Moving onto operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $151.8 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 6%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25.2% compared to the 26.3% that we reported last year. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 25% to 26% for the balance of fiscal year 2018. R&D expenses for the quarter were $40.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or in a constant currency basis an increase of 4%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.8% compared to 7.2% in the prior year. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2018. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.3 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $157.3 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $143.8 million, an increase of 39% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1, an increase of 37% over the prior quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.07. The growth in non-GAAP earnings per share was partly due to a lower tax rate this quarter. Achieving a normalized tax rated 22%, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.83, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Now I'd like to spend some time discussing tax-related matters. On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 93.3% reflecting one-time charges associated with a recent change in U.S. tax laws. U.S. accounting rules require us to recognize the effect of any tax law changes during the period in which they are enacted. Accordingly we have recorded an additional income tax expense of $126.6 million in our December quarter. Specifically this amount includes two items. First, the transition tax imposed on our accumulated foreign earnings resulting in additional income tax expense of $119.9 million; and second, the write-down of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets means a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, which resulted in additional income tax expense of $6.7 million. On a non-GAAP basis which excludes the one-time charges I've just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6%. Adjusting for the impact from ASU 2016-09 which governs accounting for the tax deductions for employee stock-based payments, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 11%. Our non-GAAP effective tax was lower this quarter because our tax rate in previous quarters have forecasted the repatriation of cash to the U.S. this fiscal year. The taxes attributable to repatriation will no longer be due in the U.S. because of the recent U.S. tax reforms. For the same reason, we now estimate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 15% to 16%. Now I'll turn to guidance on our expected fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate. There are two important factors to consider. First, Australian draft legislation designed to implement certain base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS, initiatives related to hybrid mismatches likely to be enacted in calendar year 2018 and be effective for our 2019 fiscal year. This will impact the taxation of our transactions between Australia and the rest of our global businesses and likely result in additional accessible income attributable to the Australian tax jurisdiction resulting in a higher effective tax rate. Secondly, the recent U.S. tax changes will reduce our effective tax rate predominately associated with a new territorial tax system which will allow for little or no tax on future earnings repatriated to the U.S. from our foreign subsidiaries. Taking into account, the impacts from both the Australian perspective legislative changes, and the U.S. tax legislative changes, and their estimates of the geographic attribution of our income, we estimate our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 23%. To round out the implications of the U.S. tax reform it's important to note that the U.S. legislative changes will be positive for ResMed from a financial and treasury management perspective. We will now have far more flexibility to repatriate cash back to the U.S. at little or no tax cost. We will be able to more effectively utilize our strong global cash flows to invest in growth opportunities and undertake capital management activities. Moving on from tax-related matters, during the second quarter cash flow from operations was $132.6 million reflecting strong underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $29.4 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of $49.9 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. Additionally, as we discussed during last quarter's call, we recommenced our share buyback during the second quarter and repurchased 100,000 shares consideration of $8.5 million. At December 31, we have $1 billion in gross debt and $160 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31, total assets were $3.6 billion and net equity was $2 billion. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Agnes. Agnes Lee : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Christine, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question. Margaret Kaczor : Everyone thanks for taking the question. First of all you guys had a really nice quarter in terms of showing operating leverage and SG&A leverage, even taking all the moving pieces out. But maybe walk us through what's been driving the recent results in SG&A leverage maybe what the long-term level for that SG&A or operating margin could be and really what it gets down to should we assume multiple years of leverage here? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Margaret. And as we talked about on previous calls, if you look back over five-plus-years ResMed had around 30%, 32% of our revenue in SG&A and in most recent quarters we've taken that down to 27% as a percentage of revenue because we're able to grow and leverage our world leading scale within the sleep apnea and respiratory care and now out-of-hospital software markets. We expect that to continue. And as Brett said in his prepared remarks we want to leave this fiscal year with a run rate of around 26% of our revenues at SG&A and even beyond that as we look to FY19. And so I think there's a lot of runway left for leverage around SG&A. We're a global leader, the global leader in sleep apnea and respiratory care, and we have a right to win in out-of-hospital software and I think we can leverage that scale to grow efficiently. So I'd summarize that there's a lot of runway ahead over multiple fiscal years here, Margaret. Margaret Kaczor : Good. And then just as a follow-up on international seems likes it continues to remain focus for you guys in relation in telemonitoring. I know you had some weird comps with China from the year ago period, but what inning are you guys today in driving telemonitoring internationally and are there any advanced talks on a national, regional level outside of France to drive ongoing fleet upgrades. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes, that's a great question, Margaret; it allows us to talk about digital health and connected health beyond just the United States. We've had excellent progress the last three-and-a-half years in the U.S. millions literally north of $4 million, 100% cloud connected medical devices. 6 million patients in the AirView system, and that keeps growing every day. But as we highlighted in the prepared remarks it's fantastic to see a country like France where the government who paid most of the healthcare bill through Social Security healthcare looking at the sleep apnea space and saying there is an ROI here to invest in telemonitored sleep devices. If we have patients that have telemonitored devices they use them more and as the data showed that we published and the French government knows that if the patient uses their device more they stay out of hospital more. They have a better quality of life and in fact their survival rights go up. So the French government making that change, January 1, is fantastic, we think there's a lot of runway ahead across France and as we look across Western Europe and across Europe, Asia, and all the other markets that we do business in, we are in regular conversations through our market access team with the governments and major players in the United States and other for-profit payers and we will get the message through that having telemonitoring, having connected health and digital health, improves outcomes, lowest costs, and save lives. And we do think that other countries will follow suit after France and it's great to have them out there. Operator : Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question. Sean Laaman : Good morning and thanks for taking my call. My first question is to Brett. Brett, could you give us a guide on the FX impact on GM in the quarter. Brett Sandercock : Yes. As we mentioned Sean, it was pretty meaningful this quarter. If you looked at sequentially it was kind of in the order of 50 basis points negative. So it was quite a big impact on the gross margins. So, yes, if we know that we're kind of pretty pleased with where we end up with the gross margins because we have quite a big headwind on FX. Sean Laaman : Okay, great, thanks Brett. And Mick, are you able to give us a bit of a guide on what features the Mobi has versus Activox? Mick Farrell : Sean thanks for the question. Unfortunately for the call but fortunately for our sales team and our commercial teams has been long time designing again this product ready. We're not ready yet to publicly announce the specific features and capabilities. What I said at the conference earlier this month, and I'm happy to repeat here, is that this has got really good oxygen output; it's got excellent battery life and a really good blend of all the other parameters that are needed to make out-of-home portable oxygen concentrators, the best they can be. And by putting the ResMed brand on it running it and release it when we believe the quality is at the level that deserves that brand and that's what we're working towards. Operator : David Low from J.P. Morgan is online with a question. David Low : Thanks very much for taking my questions. Perhaps we could just touch on France again, Mick just you talked about the change happening from the 1st of January, just wondering what you're seeing there, I mean presumably from the results we're seeing, you saw good buying ahead of the change and sort of where do you think we are up to in terms of sleep replacement to take advantage of the new reimbursement structure? Mick Farrell : Yes, David, as you indicated the reimbursement change went into effect January 1, but our French colleagues and customers and partners in the ecosystem in France have known about this for a number of months or quarters. And so there has been some, if you like, upgrading of the fleet from non-cloud connected to cloud connected devices over the last three, six months. We see more runway ahead of that for France. And really importantly, we see patients getting better care, using their devices more therefore using more masks, but most importantly, staying at a hospital and being well taken care of. And we think there is a positive domino effect here where other countries will see this change based upon real data including the data that we published in the Peer Reviewed press this quarter and say this is the right direction to go. So we are in active discussions well beyond just one or two countries here or 120 countries we sell our products into, we are looking to get the message out there that telemonitoring and cloud connectivity and digital health and connected care can save costs and improved lives. But more runway left in France and a lot more across the other 119 countries we sell into over the coming fiscal years. David Low : Great, thanks very much. And just one other, I mean you had very strong sales growth which is really impressive. But perhaps if you could talk to market conditions, I mean, I think let's perhaps start in the U.S. trying to get a sense as to how much is this ResMed gaining share and how much is this market conditions picking up in terms of patient setups mask replacement? Mick Farrell : Yes, that's a good question. I will hand that to Jim Hollingshead who runs our Global Sleep Business. Jim Hollingshead : Yes, thanks David. I think patient growth continues to be strong. Globally, as you know, sleep apnea is underdiagnosed and we are continuing to see increasing awareness in the markets and increasing patient setup. There is a little bit of cyclicality in the mask business especially in the U.S. because of the way deductibles, end of the calendar year and so we always get a little bit of pick up in masks, with some cyclicality, but the underlying growth in the market I think is driven by patient awareness, and obviously the economy has been a little bit stronger, so overall positive in both directions. Operator : Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is online with a question. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon, very nice quarter. Can you spend a moment talking about your Mobi portable oxygen concentrator? How is that going to be sold into the home? Will you combine that with your current home CPAP sales force? Are you going to build out something separate? Mick Farrell : That's a great question, Joanne. I'm going to hand that to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer. Rob Douglas : Yes, thanks, Mick. Joanne, we are currently selling the Activox throughout our existing sales force and doing that very successfully and the license ship and the discussion for customers around the world are very relevant and portal oxygen we think represents a really good business opportunity for many of our customers around the world. Mobi, as ResMed brand, will just be an extension of that and a stronger player and that will be part of our existing sales teams. Mobi and we are really looking forward to it coming out, we're really excited about it, it's going to have fairly strong performance. Joanne Wuensch : As a follow-up, were there anything -- was there anything specific in the quarter extra selling days, stocking, anything particularly of note that we should be able to factor in to as we think about this quarter but also project on to next year? Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks Joanne. No nothing out of the ordinary in this Q2 in terms of the channel. I think what we're seeing is we've had three-and-a-half years of the Air Solutions and AirSense portfolio that's incredibly value for customers. They continue to buy those sleep devices and those respiratory care devices that fit on the AirView platform. And we're seeing really good traction of N20 nasal mask and the F20 full face mask. These are the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable in their category. The plastic that fits on the bridge of the nose on an F20 and N20 is the thinnest and most comfortable plastic that you can have of any mask on the market. So I think that's what's leading to the share gains that we got this quarter and I think there is some sustainability to those share gains as we look forward. Joanne Wuensch : All right. Very helpful. I'll get back in queue. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks Joanne. Operator : Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is online with a question. Steve Wheen : Yes, good morning. Just a question around gross margin for Brett. You've obviously got in this quarter a particularly large headwind from currency and therefore the offset through manufacturing efficiencies was obviously pretty compelling. What's the runway like on those manufacturing efficiencies for the back half of the year because I expected actually must improve, mainly because the currency now has probably gotten even bigger headwind to come given the strength of the Aussie dollar recently? Can you just sort of talk through how that might look and what are the moving parts going into the back half of the year? Brett Sandercock : Sure, Steve. I mean we have a program around kind of initiatives in both manufacturing, procurement, logistics, and so on to really work on a number of initiatives and we're kind of keep track of that pipeline pretty full, then it's a matter of executing on those and in the time when they drop. So let's not get overly granular but we\u2019re working on that all time and we expect to kind of drop if you like initiatives that will take cost out over a period of time and there will be some of those will manifest in the second half. But it's only progressive and it's a long-term program and you just got to continue to execute on the initiatives you identify and keep that pipeline full and that's certainly what the team done. So I guess it's more progressive, Steve, rather than sort of sudden big jolt to it. So we just got to keep executing on those initiatives and that will continue to drive cost out of the all that COGS area. Steve Wheen : And so even with the Aussie Dollar at $0.80, you still got the ability to maintain that gross margin at current levels with the procurement side and manufacturing efficiencies? Brett Sandercock : Yes, I mean guiding to be broadly consistent right. We will have some headwind with Aussie at $0.80. I mean clearly if that keeps tracking up that's a different ball game but at the moment, I mean, it's a quarter away, so into Q3 it won't be so bad, if you look into Q4 then clearly there is a bit of a headwind there but we've kind of managed currencies on the Aussie all the way from mine [ph] time $0.47 to $1.03. So I think we just got to -- we just have to live with currencies moving around and make sure that we've got initiatives in place I guess to counteract that. But also I mean we will get much more broader on our manufacturing nowadays compared to what we were a decade ago. So we have manufacturing in Singapore, for example, it's pretty big, we had some in the U.S. now that we are undertaking. So I guess that portfolio is a little more balanced and then clearly as you know over many years on the material side it was really looked as sort of space or even essentially U.S. dollars to try and mitigate some of that. So it certainly has an impact but I guess there is some things we do to try and mitigate that and we've just a got to live with the currency whichever way it goes. Steve Wheen : Okay. And just with the tax changes one of the problems as you've identified is some of the repatriation in historically and now that that's some of those barriers have been somewhat removed. Is this the opportunity that you're talking to of actually capital management initiatives is that sort of the first, sort of cap off the rank with regards to what you'll be able to do now that you can shift that cash around a little bit more freely. Brett Sandercock : Yes, I mean, we certainly have the flexibility now. I guess with the reviewing that's kind of I wouldn\u2019t want to sort of preempt anything just yet but it does give us that flexibility. The clear will be around being able to utilize that cash essentially anywhere in the world and that could mean growth opportunities, acquisitions, investments where we might want to undertake. We have far more flexibility to do that. And additionally and it's not necessarily either/or, but we would have, I think the ability to do some more capital management as well. I mean, there's a few things in the tax reform you've got some limits or caps on interest deductibility and things like that. So you have to navigate a few things but for us it will, it's a great benefit for us because the flexibility is much greater than we had before. And we've kicked off the buyback for example in Q2 we will continue with that at the moment I expect it to be relatively modest or just offset the equity share grants to employees for example just sort of their $1 million to $1.5 million annually. But we certainly have more flexibility around that but not -- we don't have everything completely planned at this stage I think we're just assessing through on our options and so on. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of David Stanton from CLSA. David Stanton : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could explain how Brightree and ResMed are going about increasing mask replenishment and in particularly in the U.S. market. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yes, look I've been out to often and then maybe Jim can add into that. We have some excellent programs with Brightree Connect and ResMed ReSupply some platforms that we've enhanced and put together to provide an end-to-end service for our HME customers who want to get involved in ReSupply programs. We have automatic, email, text, interactive voice response that we can provide to our customers to go directly to their patients. We have dropship programs where we can dropship directly to the patients if the care companies require that or want that and so many offerings in that and every day we are looking at ways to upgrade our ReSupply programs including in guiding patients with their with their my applications. We think that there is an underutilization if you like of patients saying they want to get a clean mask when they need a clean mask because they don't know it's available in the options therefore. They don't know the co-pay, they don't know the timing. So we want to turn that ignorance into education and educate patients that when their mask does start to go up and/or their mask starts to get dirty they can get a new one. And this is a piece of plastic that touches your face for seven hours a night, every night, it needs to be replaced on a regular basis and we think there's an under met need to drive that. Any further detail Jim? Jim Hollingshead : I think the only thing I would add to that is the reason there are two platforms is because Brightree Connect is really designed for our HME customers who are using Brightree as their billing platform and there's many thousands of those, there is also thousands of HMEs that's don't use Brightree as their billing platform and so the ResMed ReSupply platform is really designed to be agnostic of billing since it will be usable by HMEs who are on the Brightree billing platform. In that way the two offers effectively cover the entire market. David Stanton : Thank you. And my follow-up is given your strong numbers in the U.S. in particular I wonder you should give us an updated -- your updated thoughts on U.S. market growth rates and indeed perhaps some European market growth rates as you see them going into 2018. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, David. We look at the global sleep apnea respiratory care market that we play in growing in that mid-to-high-single-digits with devices growing at the mid-single-digits and masks systems growing at the high-single-digits. Yes, clearly this quarter we took share in both of those categories. Air Solutions, AirView and the AirSense10 and AirCurve 10 systems themselves helped us gain share in the device side and these new masks not perfectly new now three or four quarters after launch but they're still growing well in the nasal and full face categories with the N20 and the F20. And I got you to tell you the AirTouch F20 that full mask has formed a nice little niche for those patients who are very sensitive to their -- to plastic on their face and now have a far more comfortable foam that they can have there. I think the market is in that mid-to-high-single-digits. I think we took share in this last quarter and then we have the capability of taking share over further quarters. But we're also putting 6%, 7% of our revenues into research and development to make sure we have a regular cadence of innovation to bring on the mask front as well as on the software front which we upgrade on a four to six weekly basis with the cloud upgrades. Operator : David Bailey from Macquarie is on line with a question. David Bailey : Yes, good morning. I just had a question on the average selling price decline just highlighted this quarter. It's been an impact over the past few years so I just wondered if you'd willing to characterize the decline you saw in second quarter relative to the industry? Mick Farrell : Yes, David we don't, haven't for four years given out ASPs. David Bailey : That\u2019s fine. Thank you very much. And just in relation to currency, you've historically provided an impact on a per share basis in previous quarters just wondering if you're able to provide us with the overall impact of currency on a per share basis for the other second quarter. Mick Farrell : Sure, Brett you want to take that question? Brett Sandercock : Yes, for this quarter was $0.02 favorable for us, which is really the reflection of the stronger euro. So it was $0.02. Operator : Matt Taylor from Barclays is online with a question. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So the first question I wanted to ask was around your device growth. It was pretty strong this quarter on a tough comp and curious if you could give us any color on some of the components I know you mentioned that the Air Solutions and AirSense platform continues to grow well. And you talked about vents. Can you talk about the different kind of sub businesses within devices and how each of those are doing? Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, Matt. We don't break out the detail between the sleep devices and the respiratory care devices. But I can breakout by geography that the devices grew globally at 9% on a constant currency basis. In Europe, Asia, and our other markets around the world it was around 5% growth of the devices and in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America groups combined we grew at 12%. A way to think about why does that relative growth by geography is the penetration rate all their solutions in the digital health and connected health platforms. The more that we're able to show that data with our customers of managing a fleet of products or managing a fleet of patients within the digital health platform enables them to see the value, reduce their labor costs when they use a ResMed device through at ecosystem their labor costs for setting up sleep apnea therapy go down by up to 59%. So that's a big compelling value proposition that you want to buy ResMed. As I said during earlier in the Q&A and during the prepared remarks we have had some success in France of getting differential reimbursement for that and I'd say that's the first geography outside the U.S. that will have now sort of an S-curve of growth if you like of the digital side that allows to bring some of that faster device growth there. But look out our French team are doing an amazing job firstly in market access and talking to the government but also in execution of driving that and we would like to see that continue their in France but also across Western Europe and other markets we participate in. Matt Taylor : Thanks for that. I just had one follow-up for Brett. I think there's a lot of things moving around on the tax line and I was wondering if you could give us some sense for when you're developing these ranges for the second half of fiscal 2018 and 2019? How much of that is still kind of moving around and what are the factors we should think about that could actually move those ranges up or down or moving within the ranges. Brett Sandercock : Yes, sure. I mean, it is -- I mean all of this is very recent and there's been a lot of activity, so these are all if you like our best estimates going forward given what we know about the draft Australian legislation and also the U.S. tax reforms. So put that guidance out there, which I'm recently confident on but they are estimates. And -- looking forward the impacts it'll just be around geographic mix of income and operations. Okay, so as operations evolve in different geographies and that can impact your tax rates typically over time. So that would be kind of longer-term impacts that you might see but on shorter-term I think that's going to be our best estimates with what we know on the legislation which you know is very hot off the press. So clearly, we will generally refine that as we go through the quarters if we need to. Operator : Vic Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question. Vic Windeyer : Hi, just quickly firstly I just wanted to understand the tax. The lower tax that brought non-GAAP back from $1 to $0.83 can you just tell us what would just be? Brett Sandercock : Yes in terms of the non essentially I broke down to -- we were forecasting some repatriation which would typically have U.S. tax attributed to it under the new tax reforms which came into forth any repatriation we make is no longer taxed in U.S. So that does in fact impact is favorably FY '18 and that has lowered our tax rate on a non-GAAP basis not having to payback tax in the U.S. Vic Windeyer : Okay, all right, great, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just in the respiratory care business I guess the -- end of that second horizon of growth I suppose that when do we sort of expect that that mark through inflection point then we go higher rate of growth out of that business given the large opportunity that resonates some of that back at sort of maybe been on slightly to the point of being modest? So I was just wondering whether you could outline how you see that coming through and the timing on that? Mick Farrell : Yes Vic, it\u2019s Mick here. Look there are the 380 million COPD patients out there, we think somewhere around 10% of them will and should have some type of therapy whether it's non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator, and/or life support ventilation. So it\u2019s a huge long-term opportunity but it\u2019s not overnight and it takes a long time. I think a really important factor about that second horizon of growth for us is that the money that can be saved for the healthcare system is huge. These 380 million patients are incredibly expensive for the healthcare system, they come back and back and back again to the emergency room and they get re-hospitalized within 90 days on a very high frequency and when they use our products and we show this in the HOT_HMV study when they use our non-invasive ventilator and they use our oxygen concentrator together, we can reduce hospitalizations by 51%. So look like we did with the French government and working with them on telemonitoring and showing the return on investment, we are going country by country, payer by payer in the full profit country insurance markets and showing these data. So it\u2019s not in overnight. ASCO it\u2019s market by market but we see a lot of runway ahead and when we launched the Mobi, we will have another part of the portfolio in there another ResMed brand that is part of the portfolio to add in there. So as you look forward to next couple of fiscal years, you will start to see some good growth out of our respiratory care business. Vic Windeyer : Good. And then just on the tax, for a follow-up, what was the tax be in FY \u201919 Brett, if the Aussie legislation doesn't get through? What is the impact of that particular component there? Brett Sandercock : Yes, in the unlikely event it didn't go through then that would likely pull it back to closer, closer to the corner right, so we are saying second half. So yes more like that $0.15, $0.16, $0.17 are if it didn't go through or happen to be delayed or something like that. But I think that's a very low likelihood, I think that's going to parliament in February and I expect that to be passed. Operator : Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is online with a question. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. So Brett you mentioned 50 bps negative FX impact. Can you split out the impact because the dollar, the U.S. dollar as we know has depreciated quite a bit against the Euro whether you want to look at it from the beginning of 2017 or even from the beginning of 2018, the Aussie Dollar obviously has strengthened so I understand they are working against each other but is 50 beeps the net impact and if you could kind of give us what happened from a revenue perspective what was the FX impact on the top-line. Brett Sandercock : Yes, the top-line was that kind of grow that grow from a 11% to 13% so that couple percent benefit if you like with the strong euro year-on-year. The 50 basis points I mentioned was sequential that's coming through from Q1 to Q2 and if you look at the kind of Euro sequentially it was relatively flat but all the -- has been kicking up and then we have the impact of one quarter lag. So you've seen that appreciate over that time. That has driven that sequential impact for us. Suraj Kalia : Got it. And Mick one question for you in terms of Brightree can you give us the broad contours of your international strategy? Congrats on a nice quarter. Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks Suraj. Brightree really is a U.S. designed and operated software. However we do have software programmers who are in the UK and in other parts of the world, so it is a globally supplied business. We operate in 120 countries, the amazing efficiency that we brought to our U.S homecare customers with Brightree, I wouldn't want to limit to just that country. Having said that I don't want to distract the team from the really strong teams level double-digit growth and so they will be focused on that but Suraj it's a good question and one we're looking at and we are looking at other geographies including ones that where we're heavily invested to think can we start some pilot trials and experiments some greatest experiments if you like of taking the Brightree technology to some of the other markets that we do business in. So I guess that's part of our Horizon three strategy that out-of-hospital software expansion you'll see us talk more about that as we go forward. Operator : Tom Godfrey from UBS is online with a question. Tom Godfrey : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me with regards to the new AirTouch memory foam cushion sort of set up I'm just wondering if you've heard from any of your customers always it's got the 30 day replenishment schedule anything from your customers around pushback from funders just given that increased replacement run rate or are you managing to show enough sort of uplifting compliance or comfort levels, so that funders are happy to increase replacement. Thanks a lot. Mick Farrell : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead from our global sleep business perspective. Jim Hollingshead : Yes, thanks Tom. I think the most remarkable thing about mask is the patient feedback we receive on it. It's an incredibly comfortable mask and the patient feedback is really almost overwhelmingly positive on it. From a funding perspective as we take it as our channel partners we're working with them for them to fully understand the replenishment cycle and what impact that might have depending on what insurance the patient has or what the funding situation is patient by patient. And so we haven't heard any real feedback, any real negative feedback from the market probably about the mask but it\u2019s being put on patients who for whom it's appropriate given there in particular either health insurance situation or they're paying out of pocket or whatever. Mick Farrell : Yes, I mean I'd one to that it's such a comfortable mask that it could be a second line of defense if a patient doesn't tolerate LSR or plastic touching their face, there are people who object to that it interferes with their sleep. Foam is incredibly comfortable it\u2019s what lot mattresses are made out of it feels more like the bedcovers and so it's a great niche that I think goes after those customers who need that and as Jim said it will depend on the insurance and the reimbursement schedule but also depends on that individual patient selection. And if you're able to get a patient compliant versus not compliant the difference is as we showed in those published data a huge for the healthcare system, so they're sort of self evident but obviously we're collecting health economics and market access data while we launch a product like this into all our markets. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Great thanks Christine. In closing, I want to thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team for their execution on our product launches and their commitment to our operating excellence initiatives. This quarter that work translated into continued market share gains, strong revenue growth, and excellent operating leverage. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit our customers, patients, physicians, payers, and providers. Thank you for your time. And we will talk to you again in 90 days. Agnes Lee : Okay, thank you again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investors.resmed.com. Christine you may now close the call.

Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd. Operator : Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2018 ResMed, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tim, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to David Pendarvis, Chief Administration Officer and Global General Counsel. David, you may begin. David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for attending ResMed's earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending March 31st. Joining us on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO; Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. In addition to the financial information presented on today's call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, our earnings press release and our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018. These documents will be available on our Investor Relations website at investor.resmed.com (sic) [investors.resmed.com] (00:01:07). A replay and a transcript of today's call will also be made available at that location shortly after this call. Now on today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. The descriptions and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures are available in our earnings release and will also be in our SEC filings. Our discussion today may also include forward-looking statements, such as expectations for ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but of course actual results may differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in our SEC filings. I'll now hand the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Dave, and thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us today as we review the financial results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I'll review top level financial results, business highlights and key announcements this quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett Sandercock who'll walk you through our financial results in more detail. So first, our top level financial results. I'm really grateful to our global team for another quarter of very strong performance. We achieved double-digit revenue growth, 15% headline growth and 10% constant currency growth, led by sales in Europe and Asia; and then those combined regions we grew at 16%, 1-6, 16% in constant currency. Revenue in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America grew 7% overall in line with market growth. At the bottom line, we are continuing to drive operating leverage as we did in Q2. Adjusted net operating profit in Q3 grew 25% year-over-year which was an excellent result and the outcome of our global teams' hard work and operating excellence. This translated to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92. We are proud of this strong top line and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team. Now some business highlights, and let's start with Brightree. Growth in our Brightree software-as-a-service business continues to be strong at 14% year-on-year. The Brightree team has been part of the ResMed Group for two full years and there's a stable record of success. To show Brightree's scale, here is an interesting metric. In the last 12 months, Brightree systems handled more than 8.2 billion digital requests. By quickly and accurately responding to these cloud-based requests, Brightree helps its users reach more patients more efficiently, more effectively and more economically. In terms of next steps, Brightree is beta-testing with select customers an exciting, new analytics platform using data from algorithms that will generate actionable insights for customers to improve their business effectiveness and their patient care. We look forward to Brightree bringing value to customers with this new data analytics offering in the very near future. For the longer term, we are very pleased to continue to have Raj Sodhi, the President of our Software-as-a-Service business focus not only on Brightree but also on new growth opportunities in the global out-of-hospital software market. Raj and his team are working to enable an ecosystem of connected software and human services to create a frictionless network for data and information to move across the healthcare value chain, so that as people progress through their personal healthcare journey, their medical data can seamlessly follow them. Brightree solutions were featured in the interoperability showcase at HIMSS that stands for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Conference. Brightree's participation in these demonstrations at HIMSS with over 7,000 visitors touring the interoperability showcase is just one example of our ResMed and Brightree commitment to connecting the post-acute care industry and patients to the rest of their care settings across that digital healthcare ecosystem. The response from current customers, prospects, and industry stakeholders at HIMSS has been very positive. We will continue to showcase the power of an interconnected out-of-hospital software platform to the rest of the industry. Turning to our core sleep apnea and COPD businesses. We continue to pioneer new horizons in those core businesses with digital health. We passed some very significant milestones during the quarter that I think were worth noting. Our cloud-based patient management system called AirView now supports over 5 million 100% cloud-connected medical devices across the globe. More than 7 million patients are included in the AirView system for their AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, AirMini, S9, Lumis, Stellar and Astral device platforms. We are proud of the extent to which this market-leading system has been adopted around the world but we want to be clear that we recognize that this is just mile one of our digital healthcare marathon. All these digital health nodes connecting every day have produced an incredible resource. We now have over two billion nights of medical sleep and COPD therapy data in the cloud. I'll talk a little later about how we are turning this big data or big clinical data into actionable information for our customers and the ultimate customer, the patient. Our connected health strategy received another boost this quarter when Japan announced a revised reimbursement system that allows physicians to be paid for remote telemonitoring of CPAP patients. Japanese guidelines already require that doctors meet at least once every 90 days with CPAP uses. The new guidelines, effective April 1, have allowed remote telemonitoring to substitute for face-to-face meetings up to two times per quarter. This new system will allow busy physicians and patients as their patient pool grows to continue to receive excellent patient care without having to meet as frequently in person. In anticipation of increasing demand for telemonitoring capability, our Japanese customers have stepped up their adoption of the AirView platform and AirSense 10 devices, our 100% cloud-connected sleep apnea therapeutic devices. This was a factor in some of our very strong sales in Japan during Q3. We are confident that in the future, this will make it easier for patients who are not treated today to begin and remain on CPAP therapy, happy and healthy at home. Today, now, three of our largest sleep apnea therapy geographies, the U.S., France and now Japan all have systems that incentivize the adoption of our market-leading connected health solutions that includes AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, AirView and myAir. During Q3, the French market continued to benefit from its own telemonitoring reimbursement incentives where there's a differential between telemonitored and non-telemonitored sleep apnea therapeutic devices. France and Japan, combined with good execution in a number of other countries worldwide, have contributed to very strong growth of device revenue across Europe and Asia during Q3. This category grew 18% year-over-year in constant currency across those regions. Our U.S., Canada, and Latin America device business was in line with market growth this quarter, growing at 6% year-over-year. We continue to see very good adoption of our connected healthcare solutions in these markets by customers and patients and we continue to improve our offerings. We just announced that our patient engagement app called myAir, and that's for all of our Air 10 devices, is now available on Android-based phones. We're happy to now offer the same high quality in-app experience to all patients with myAir whether they use iOS from Apple or Android from Google, they can all use in-app care now, not the web-based care. The most important differentiator here at ResMed from our competitors is our people. Our passion, our skills and our dedication to changing lives with every breath. We were thrilled this quarter to announce the appointment of Bobby Ghoshal as our new Chief Technology Officer. This appointment enhances our management bench strength as we continue to build our leadership in connected health. Bobby has over 25 years of experience as a Technology Engineer and a Technology Executive at Wipro, Motorola, Freescale and most recently at Brightree. He has both the technical expertise as well as the cultural fit with ResMed to help us take our healthcare informatics leadership and data analytics solutions along with Dana DiFernandino (sic) [Dana DiFerdinando] and her team to the next level. We will continue to work with payers across the globe on a number of initiatives in this space and also regarding reimbursement and market access. Two recent wins are worth noting. First, France announced that beginning April 1, reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices, so the dental devices that we sell to treat sleep apnea, would increase by 35%. Our product, the Narval MRD is a device that leads the market in France, and we will continue to drive MRD sales in France and other geographies where that category can be just as successful. Second, South Korea will soon begin reimbursing diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for sleep apnea. This is a great opportunity for us to help the many, many millions of South Koreans who need our solutions. On the masks and accessories side of our business in Q3, we saw solid global constant currency growth of 9%. This was led by Europe and Asia markets, which grew 13% in constant currency in the masks categories. We are seeing good traction with our AirFit F20 and our AirFit N20 products in these regions. We're also encouraged by the success of our AirFit N20 Classic. The N20 Classic combines the comfort and seal of our InfinitySeal cushion used across our AirFit series with an adaptive forehead support for stability and to adjust the mask tension to movement. The N20 Classic is performing well in the very specific countries we are targeting and validates our approach to find unique solutions for different geographies around the world in over 120 countries that we do business in. The U.S., Canada, and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth of 8% in our masks and accessories category, which is in line with market growth. We saw a continued preference for the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 masks by patients, physicians and our channel partners. To help catalyze even better growth as we look forward, we are excited to be launching excited to be launching a technology upgrade onto the F20 and to the N20 platforms. At Medtrade, we demonstrated the new ResMed QuietAir diffuser technology, which results in masks that are 89% quieter and that have 70% more diffused airflow. What does this mean? Well, with this technology, our full face masks noise level are down to 21 dBA, which is well below ambient noise in the bedroom. With ResMed's new QuietAir technology, we are providing patients and their bed partners with a peace and quiet they deserve for better sleep. We think patients particularly, as well as providers and physicians, will adopt QuietAir technology very rapidly, so watch this space. Now for some business highlights of our operating excellence initiatives across ResMed. We are pleased this quarter to be able to continue to show our delivery in operating leverage to improve our bottom line. We grew non-GAAP income from operations by 25% in the quarter. We combined solid revenue growth and stable margins with disciplined growth in SG&A which grew at just 3% in constant currency and research and development which grew at just 4% in constant currency. I want to emphasize that our operating excellence initiatives are about the long term and they're about working more efficiently. They're about being more focused on eliminating waste and they're about working smarter. Let's look at a quick case study here of our medical affairs team and their operating excellence initiatives here at ResMed. The medical affairs team led by Dr. Carlos Nunez, our Chief Medical Officer, has adjusted its balance between traditional, randomized placebo-controlled trials and new big data, clinical data-based trials, analyzing real world digital databases. Carlos has assembled a global team of key opinion leaders within ResMed and beyond to ask tough clinical questions and investigate them, leveraging the 2 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data in their view. These efforts are starting bear fruit. Our medical affairs team is pending less money, reducing the time to complete the studies and increasing the number of top-quality clinical studies that they are completing and pushing through the publication. The peer review process and top medical journals have accepted that these data-driven studies are important and worthy of publication. In short, ResMed is not only a pioneer in digital health, we are now pioneers in digital health research, all with the cause of better patient outcomes. In one example, in this space, in the last 12 months, our team prepared a study looking at over 128,000 patient records. The analytical process took a few months and produced positive results and was accepted into a top-tier industry journal, The Journal of Sleep Medicine and the results were impressive, showing our patient engagement tools drive adherence to our CPAP therapy, significantly higher than typical adherence to a pharmaceutical pill. We continue to do other big data studies and we are excited that several abstracts have been accepted for presentation in just next month, a couple of weeks actually, at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Thoracic Society right here in San Diego, California. You'll hear more about these studies when they are presented, so watch this space. Finally, some business highlights from our product development teams. Our amazing product development teams continue to deliver meaningful product innovation. As I mentioned earlier, we are launching brand new QuietAir technology to our AirFit range, starting with the F20 full face mask, and our mask pipeline after that is full. As we speak, we are in the process of commencing a controlled product launch of Mobi, our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator. Mobi helps people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and others who require oxygen therapy to live life with fewer restrictions. Mobi's great balance of battery life, weight, and oxygen delivery provides patients with the freedom to continue therapy while being mobile and active which is what their doctors want, whether it's just around the neighborhood or across the country or across the globe. This control product launch is the start of our ResMed branded journey in the portable oxygen concentrator market. In the U.S., only around 8% of those people who are eligible to receive a portable oxygen concentrator have such a device. We think that's wrong and it's an unmet need and ResMed can help fulfill it. It's also part of our long-term mission to change lives in COPD. There are hundreds of millions of people around the world with this debilitating disease. Our goal is to give them better quality of life to reduce the cost of care and to help them keep happy and well at home and on the go. Finally, we are in the process of launching a new smartphone app-based sleep apnea screening technology in China. We call this technology sleep cue (00:19:56). Sleep cue (00:19:59) uses a very inexpensive lightweight tube combined with smartphone software technology to detect sleep disturbances that suggest a person may be at risk for sleep apnea. This very affordable and very easy to use solution will give our China team another tool to reach the many, many tens of maybe hundreds of millions of undiagnosed sleep apnea sufferers in China. We will continue to keep you updated as this technology is launched by our ResMed and Curative teams across Greater China. Three quarters now through our fiscal year, we have achieved solid revenue growth and stronger operating profit growth. Our connected health strategy continues to play out across multiple markets with our digital health ecosystem now including over 2 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data. We have seen success with new and upgraded masks and devices and software solutions including the N20, the F20, AirTouch, the AirMini and upgraded myAir. We look forward to early results from our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator, the Mobi, as we move forward in the coming quarters and fiscal years. We have a robust pipeline of innovation for the future as well. Most importantly, we have a talented and motivated ResMed team serving patients in over 120 countries. We are positioning the company for long-term top and bottom-line growth for 2020 and beyond as we execute our strategy and lead the med tech field to create value with digital health solutions. We continue to be laser focused on our goals of slowing chronic disease progression reducing overall healthcare system costs and most importantly improving outcomes and quality of life for our ultimate customers, patients. With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll go over to Q&A. Brett? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $591.6 million, an increase of 15% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $317.5 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $234.2 million, an increase of 29% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 16% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $168.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $149.4 million, an increase 8% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $160.1 million, an increase of 31% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 18%. Mask and other sales were $74.1 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 13% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the third quarter was $39.9 million, an increase of 14% over of the prior-year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and tax-related charges associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the March quarter was 58.2% compared to 58.3% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely change in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for Q4 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 FY 2018 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.9 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 3%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 25% compared to the 26.8% we reported in Q3 last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the vicinity of 25% for Q4. R&D expenses for the quarter were $37.4 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.3% compared with 6.8% in the prior-year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 6% to 7% for Q4. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $159 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $132.5 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.92, an increase of 30% of over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.76. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $0.04 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the stronger Australian dollar. During the quarter, we recognized restructure expenses of $10.9 million associated with the strategic global workforce planning review. Associated with this review, we also expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $7 million during Q4 FY 2018. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 15.4%. As discussed during the previous quarter, we had recorded additional income tax expense of $126.6 million relating to the newly enacted U.S. tax laws as submitted under the SEC guidance if calculation is provisional until December 22, 2018 a year after the enactment of the rule. Based on recent IRS guidance on the new law, we continue to refine our calculations which resulted in additional income tax expense of $5.6 million being recorded in our third quarter results. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the one-time charge I just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. We estimate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 13% to 15%. Turning to fiscal year 2019, we continue to estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 23%. As we discussed last quarter, this rate reflects both the anticipated unfavorable impact of prospective Australian tax legislation and the favorable impact of the recent U.S. tax law changes. Now, I would like to update you on the Australian Taxation Office order that is described in our Q3 press release and our previous SEC filings. At the end of the quarter, we received notices of amended assessments from the Australian Taxation Office for the years 2009 to 2013. Based on these assessments, the ATO is asserting that ResMed owes a total $151.7 million in additional income tax and $38.4 million in accrued interest. Essentially, this is a transfer pricing dispute around the jurisdictional split of certain activities and the tax on related income. We do not agree with the ATO's decision on the issues raised in the audit. We intend to pursue administrative and legal steps to defend our position and we continue to believe we will be successful in defending our position. As a normal convention, we have agreed with the ATO to pay 50% of the Amended Tax Assessments, pending resolution of the dispute. We have recorded this is a liability in the current quarter. However, we have also recognized an offsetting asset relating to these amounts and have not recognized any additional tax expense in relation to these assessments. It is important to note that irrespective of the outcome of the tax dispute, we do not expect it to materially change our underlying effective tax rate guidance for fiscal year 2019 and beyond. Ultimately, if we do not prevail in this dispute, there would be a significant one-time tax expense and interest charge recorded at that time. Finally, on tax-related matters, I am pleased to advise, earlier this month, we agreed with the Singapore Economic Development Board to extend our investment and tax incentive programs through to the year 2030. While actual incentives are confidential but broadly consistent with our original agreement which was due to expire in 2020. Moving on from tax-related matters. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was $149.1 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $29.3 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $50 million. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. We also continued to have share buyback during the quarter and repurchased 200,000 shares for consideration of $19.4 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into a new syndicated debt facility that provides for an $800 million five-year revolving facility with an uncommitted option to increase the facility for an additional $300 million. Furthermore, we also entered into a $200 million five-year term loan. The term loan funds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of the credit facility. We continue to progressively repatriate cash back to the U.S. enabling us to more effectively utilize our strong global cash flows. At March 31, we had $800 million gross debt and $106 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with relatively modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $3.5 billion and net equity was $2.1 billion. And with that, I'll hand the call back to David. David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We'll now turn to Q&A. We ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Tim, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets is on the line with a question. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good afternoon (00:33:08), everybody. How are you? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Well, Joanne. How are you? Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): We are doing A-okay here in New York. Finally, sunny. When I take a look at your devices and your masks and accessories, your international growth is particularly strong. Is there anything that you can comment on as it relates to that? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Joanne, by the way, it's sunny in San Diego as well. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have some items that were extraordinary, the change in reimbursement in Japan of giving physicians the opportunity to get reimbursed for telemonitoring visits, which they frankly need as they're getting overloaded with the in-person visits every 90 days with larger and larger growing sleep apnea patient populations meant that there was physician demand for telemonitoring capabilities which meant that our customers, the large home care companies in Japan, have certainly, in the last quarter and will continue to, upgraded their fleets to be even more cloud-connected. And so that meant, if they're using S9s in their pool, they needed to move to AirSense10, 100% cloud connected medical devices. So there's some extraordinary growth there in Japan. And as we also said last quarter and it continued this quarter, the reimbursement changes in France where there's a significant differential between the cloud-connected sleep apnea therapeutic device and a non-cloud connected sleep apnea therapeutic device in terms of reimbursement because the French government has seen that they get higher adherence through the coaching and techniques like AirView on the cloud-connected devices, they have a differential reimbursement. So I think those impacts in France and Japan are together moving beyond. And as you've been watching us the last two, three fiscal years, since we launched our AirView solution in the United States, we've seen some significant growth of that over the last two, three years and now in line growth in the U.S. So I think those are some of the factors that contributed to that, Joanne. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That's very helpful. One of the things that Brightree brought to you was a very good platform in the United States. But my memory is that it was not as strong internationally. Can you discuss where that might be going and what your plans are there? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So certainly, Brightree is \u2013 although globally resourced, you know, we have software teams in various countries around the world that support Brightree, that it's focused on a customer base which is home medical equipment, HME companies in the United States and that's still the core focus of Brightree. However, Raj Sodhi, who is the President of that global software-as-a-service business team is looking and growing both organically and potential inorganically that business over the period between now and 2020, the period between now and 2025 as we look forward in our strategy. So, if you look back at a trailing 12 months, you've got 6%, 7% or so of our global revenues coming from software-as-a-service, the vast majority of that is Brightree, but we do have some other mask replenishment and other software-as-a-service revenue in there as well that will continue to grow and I think ahead of the ResMed Group within that software-as-a-service part into other geographies over time. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Terrific. Thank you so much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Joanne. Operator : David Low is on the line with JPMorgan. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. If we could just start with the restructuring charges, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more insight into what those charges relate to and what the expected benefit will be and I presume that we won't be seeing any more of that going into the new financial year. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look ... Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: You know, the... Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: ...I'll give you the high level sort of strategic rationale and then hand to Brett for some of the details, David. The strategic rationale was, we're changing to a more and more, as I just related to Joanne's question, a more and more software-driven medical device company. And I'd say with $5 million, 100% cloud-connected medical devices, the world's leading cloud-connected and remote-monitoring med tech company. And so, we're changing our go-to-market model to be more software-driven, more software sales and changing our approach to that. And so that there's some structural changes and others associated with that. It's really around Q3 and Q4 as Brett talked to. But Brett, why don't I hand to you for any further detail on that? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. So, I mean, it very much was a strategic view and just looking at where we needed to invest in terms of our talent and growth areas. So we've looked long and hard at that, and the restructure is probably focused between 200 employees and 250 employees impacted through that restructure or reorganization. We've got -we took some charge in Q3 and we do on the U.S. GAAP, we'll take the kind of balance of that through into Q4, but our expectation is that we wouldn't see any sort of significant restructures into FY 2019. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Okay. Great. Now, that's helpful. Thank you. Look, the other question I had is the operating leverage has been phenomenal. The SG&A growth, R&D to a lesser degree growing much more slowly than the top line. Is that sustainable? I mean, should we be assuming that SG&A in particular will grow in the low-single digits and through that the operating leverage will continue on out into FY 2019 and beyond? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. David, I'd parse that out into two categories. I think in the SG&A side, we'd like to see that grow well less than half our revenue growth. You saw a 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter. We want to keep our SG&A growth below that, well below that. On the R&D front, there's different investments that we make in different parts of the business, the software side and in the device side. And I would probably say that we're going to look to keep our R&D as a percentage of revenue in the vicinity of that sort of 6% to 7% range. And sort of \u2013 so therefore, it might grow closer to \u2013 if we're keeping at 7%, let's say, of our revenues then it's going to grow closer to our revenue line. So operating leverage I think in SG&A and keeping that growth under control. And actually, we're just working smarter as I said in the prep remarks and finding systems and capabilities to solve problems and thinking more digitally and scalably about how our team approaches problems. Rather than just looking to hire more people, we can look to hire smarter systems and engage smarter systems so that our team can be more engaged on more strategic issues. That's sort of how we're looking at it, David. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. That's very helpful. Thanks very much. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator : Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is on the line with the question. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First one from me is, just a little bit more clarity on France and Japan in terms of penetration of cloud-connected devices, and really a sense of can this be a multiyear benefit, certainly in these two countries and then beyond that, where you guys can continue to grow at this double-digit range above the market internationally. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think, I'll have a first go of that and then hand it over to Rob to look at it. But, look, these are big changes, Margaret, that have happened and they didn't happen overnight. Our market access team has been working in France with the French ministry for health for the last 5 years to 10 years to talk about telemonitoring and certainly showing the benefits that we've seen in the U.S. And with our Japanese team, similarly, market access teams working with customers in the Japanese ministry for health to show these benefits. So, these have been multiyear campaigns of working on market access to demonstrate that cloud-connected devices have better adherence, they are better for the healthcare system, they save costs for hospitalizations. So there will be multiyear benefits. But Rob, do you want to provide some more detail as to sort of that S curve, if you like, of penetration of the actual devices that Margaret is sort of asking about? Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mick. We're very impressed with the rate at which our U.S. customers understood the value proposition of connected care. And as Mick said, we've had multiyear campaigns to make those value propositions in other markets. We believe the value proposition actually is there in every market that we're in and then what the reimbursement structure is and how that works, but it does take time to run these programs and develop it. The French one, as Mick said, it's been the result of many, many years of work and really changing the trajectory of connected care and how it works. Now, the value of the connected care, as our data have shown, is that more people stay on treatment. And so long-term, there's a greater pool of patients in the environment that need to stay \u2013 cared for, they need to stay on mask, and that really is building on benefit that lasts long term in these markets. And we have seen that in the U.S. as well and we'd expect to see that benefit of making this treatment of sleep apnea in the home a much more accountable and transparent treatment to everyone involved in the system, keeps more patients on treatment and we'll keep growing it. We've got a long list of other markets that we're focusing on and we look forward to reporting our changes in reimbursement programs or major progress as it happens in the future. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up to the top line growth, you guys really mentioned multiple new product initiatives and a very full product pipeline whether that's on the mask side, Brightree otherwise. Is there a cadence of product launches that you guys look at per year, is it a couple, is it more than that? And what kind of makes you guys pull the trigger on one product versus another? Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Margaret, that's a great question. Yeah. We have a very full pipeline and our goal is to bring a cadence of very innovative products and appropriate timing that the customers want them, not faster than patients need the next generation and not slower than customers need them. And I don't know, if you talk to any sleep apnea patient worldwide and say, would you like your product smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected. They always say yes. So we know there's demand there and we really are trying to make sure that that cadence is regular and strong and not too fast because patients aren't ready necessarily to switch masks or to switch software technologies too fast, but it's fast enough to make sure that the innovation is there and can have, for the company, good, sustainable long-term growth, but for the patients ensure that we're making it smaller, quieter and more comfortable and more connected every time. A good example is the N20 Classic for this quarter. A product that's not quite as sexy maybe as myAir, but a needed product for some of those markets in Europe and in Asia and we brought that product to market for those categories in that basic nasal category mask and it's been very successful. On the other end of the spectrum, we got our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator on controlled product launch here in the U.S. and we're really excited to see how those business models go as we partner with home medical equipment companies to reach the 92% of people who should have an oxygen concentrator in this country and don't. And then when we get it right, we'll scale that to the other 119 countries we do business in. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Margaret. Operator : Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Thank you. Good morning, Mick. I have a couple of questions on Brightree, is it \u2013 another good number. I don't know if you could help us frame perhaps the contribution from subscription pricing and maybe throw some comments on adoption rates for Brightree? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, Brightree has been part of our group for two years and has grown pretty well in double-digit range during that time and there are many, many HMEs across the country who use Brightree and there are many who don't yet use Brightree and that we need to get on the Brightree platform. It provides such efficiency in prescription management, in inventory management, in delivery of product and monitoring of patients and resupply of patients that we think the value proposition is there for the large chunk of the market that doesn't yet have Brightree. We do have the lead in software-as-a-service in the home medical equipment side and we plan to continue that. So I'd say there's a lot of road ahead but some steady growth. I mean, look, there is consolidation in the home medical equipment space. If you go back prior to competitive bidding, there were maybe 6,000, 7,000 home medical equipment companies, maybe now there are 3,500 or 3,000 or so. But Brightree works on a per user per month approach and we think that it has some good growth ahead. And we'll continue to invest to make sure that our software-as-a-service value proposition not only meets and beats the competition but looks around corners to see where those customers will need their next innovation from. And in addition to that, we're looking to add on capabilities, as I said, in other geographies around the world where out-of-hospital software is not limited to the U.S. geography. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Sure, sure. Thanks, Mick. And the other thing we're trying to understand about Brightree, it's not just about CPAP. But I wonder if this is going to help, Brightree will assist the rollout of the Mobi, for example, I don't know if you can give us your thoughts on that. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Well. The rollout of the Mobi is going to be dependent upon the go-to-market strategy and the value proposition of that product within the space. So, look, as I said in the prep remarks, it's got a really good balance of that oxygen output, the battery life and the weight of the device versus the competition, so I think in the product side, it's going to do really well. And in the go-to-market models, we're really looking at partnering with our channel to make sure we can reach those patients, who need it and drive it forward. So, I would say it's more our relationships with our home medical equipment companies across the spectrum both the products we sell and CPAP, APAP, all the masks, bilevels and ventilators as much as our software platform. So, it will add to our knowledge and capability in partnership with our channel. But I'd say it's more our partnership and the other portfolio of products is going to help us with Mobi. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Got it. Thank you, Mick. That's all I have. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean. Operator : Craig Wong Pan is online with Deutsche Bank has a question. Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): I just want to touch on the U.S. market. I mean, fairly good growth there you said in line with markets, but I did note that it has slowed from the second quarter. So, from down from 12% down 6% to 8% now, could you just talk to the \u2013 put some growth there? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. The U.S. market \u2013 well, the global market, we say, is growing in that sort of mid to high-single digits. So, we definitely held share and in some categories, we took some share and some others we held or maybe lost a little in some of the masks. But basically, in in-line sales, I mean, if you think about our U.S. geography for the last 12 quarters, we've been ahead of market growth and you don't stay ahead of market growth forever and there are product cycles. But I think that we did very well in the U.S. market with the comparables and how we performed in the last 12 quarters to grow at 7% in the U.S., Canada, Latin America geographies. And I've got to tell you, we think it's a sustainable growth. And as you add on technologies like QuietAir, which makes those masks 89% quieter and the customers don't have to add any more SKUs, it will roll into the same F20 and N20 SKUs they have and so the administration, the channels all up and running within N20, F20 with a huge patient benefit improvement and therefore lower return rates, higher adherence, better for the payer, better for the patient, better for the healthcare provider. I think that you're going to see some very sustainable and increased growth in the U.S. geography. But look, we've got a 29-year track record of doing pretty well in the U.S. geography and I think we will continue to do that as I look forward through not just Q4 but all of FY 2019. Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. And then just my follow-up question on QuietAir, I missed whether you talked about the timing release of that and then is that the main reason for sort of your expectation of 2019 being higher than the market growth? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So we launched QuietAir technology at Medtrade, so that was during this last quarter and in Q3 at the trade show. But look, yeah, as you said, it's an S curve, a penetration as that technology rolls out in Q4 and throughout the fiscal year. And so we will see that start to roll through the customers in this quarter and I think when those demonstrations start to happen with the RTs, with the respiratory therapists and the people who do the setups and they get the demo where this thing is lower than 21 dBA, I mean that's quieter than the air conditioning in your office right now, it's quieter than however quiet you get to your home, it's quieter than that, that ambient noise. And so it's basically getting down to stretching the envelope of new silence. So we're really excited about the technology and I think we will watch and see how it goes, certainly the initial patient trials and the control product releases with this have been successful and the trials and let's see how it goes in the real world. We are very confident that this will be a successful technology for the channel for patients and for physicians wanting to prescribe it. Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Great. Thank you. Operator : Andrew Goodsall with MST is online with a question. Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee : Thanks very much for taking my call. Perhaps if I could just ask you the pricing environment in the U.S., and I guess just thinking ahead to the next round of competitive bidding in the positive reforms there, just your expectations where pricing will even out to? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew, look pricing environment is very stable in the U.S. and we don't go into details of what that is, but it's stable, there's no big step changes within the U.S. pricing market right at the moment. As far as details with regard to competitive bidding and where we're at in that sort of seven-year process with the U.S. government and CMS, Dave, you want to provide some color for Andrew on that? David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Andrew, it's hard to say that the next round of competitive bidding is scheduled for January 1 of 2019. We've got no guidance from CMS as to how that process is going to be conducted and time is getting a little short. So it's not clear what the timing is going to be. However, there have been two significant changes to the process that came in legislatively, one, is that bids have to be binding this time and which means that you should eliminate the sort of lowball bidders who are maybe bidding low on one category to get another or otherwise you're taking to flyer. And the second change is that there will be no limit on the bid ceiling, you can bid higher if you like. So just those two factors alone we think will lead to more rational bidding. We've gotten some good signals from CMS that there should be some other reform coming. We'll wait to see when those signals actually turn into reality. But there's some good strong indications that you could see a better bidding process this time and certainly what we would support and we've been working with our partners and with CMS to try to make that happen. So time will tell, but we're encouraged. Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee : Thank you. And just my follow-up, you've called out Korea, France, Japan is positive jurisdictions I guess, is there any other countries that we should be sort of focusing on where you think there's also a bit of positive momentum? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, Andrew, I mean France and Japan had that big change with telemonitoring. So I think there's a long runway of future growth there. I mean, you don't have to go far around the OECD countries to see where other telemonitoring capabilities and connected care, connected health capabilities might be growing. South Korea is kind of unique, where it's gone from no reimbursement to reimbursement. So that's a really sort of positive sign for a really long-term play of growth and access to \u2013 many, many millions of South Koreans can now get access to reimburse care, not just the people who could afford to pay out of pocket. So I think that's a really good development there. Other geographies to watch, well, we talked about the Sleep cue (00:51:54), this very low cost screening technology that just runs off a smartphone that's going to launch and 1.3 billion person market there in China. We're incredibly excited about the potential of that. But look, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're just launching the technology. There's a lot of technologies that go into a country like China and such adoption of smartphone-based buying and selling of everything. I was in our office in Suzhou and you can't buy a cup of coffee without using a smartpay from your smartphone system. No, you couldn't use cash, credit card only a smartpay system, so the technology adoption in China is just incredibly quick and so who knows if we can get above that technology noise and make it go. But I think that's another geography to watch there, Andrew. Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : David Stanton with CLSA is on line with a question. David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my questions. First one just a follow-up perhaps on Andrew's previous question. What are we hearing from the government around bundling and bundling trials, any updates on that please? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Dave, why don't you take that? David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: David, there's been no word on bundling as part of the CMS competitive bidding process. When that came out some time ago it was going to be a trial that would start in 2019. As I indicated, time is getting very short to even put out the basic rules for competitive bidding much less, some trial and non-bid markets. But the bottom line is we've heard nothing about it. We continue to have supporters that we talk to both in the customers and in the legislature in CMS who made it clear that we think that's a bad idea. We're hopeful it won't go forward, but we've heard nothing. David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Right. Thank you. And my follow-up is can you explain a little bit more, give us some more color around how Brightree helps you with your replenishment of mask growth? Thanks very much Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, David. So we have two offerings for our U.S. customers with regard to replenishment of mask offerings for patients who want them. We have a technology solution called ResMed ReSupply, which we offer to customers that run on any digital backend system for their homecare company and so it's available to all customers across the U.S. And then we also have a technology called Brightree Connect, which is specifically for resupply of masks and accessories for customers, not just ResMed, but for any masks and accessories they provide. And so we have two technologies that we have out there in the market and they've got different capabilities and appeal to different sort of segments, if you like, of the market there, David. David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Great. Thanks very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question for the day will be from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse is on the line. Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks very much. So I just wanted to go back to international and really work out some of the trends, say, in the other rest of world markets particularly Germany, because you haven't really called out Germany at all this time. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes, Gretel. Look, our German healthcare team, which is led by our CEO there, Katrin Pucknat, and I just had a conversation with her this morning. We've seen some really good growth of our German healthcare business over the last couple of fiscal years. And Katrin is really changing the approach and the service mentality of our go-to-market teams there in Germany. There was no brand new news in the last 90 days. So I wasn't neglecting one of our top five countries. I also didn't talk about ANZ, which is another strong growth area. We had really good growth in many sales in that sort of consumer pay segment in Australia and New Zealand and Catherine Delamare who leads that business is doing a great job. But look, within Germany, it's as steady as she goes growth there. And I think that as we look all the technologies that I talked about that we provide to our customers globally, we are providing to ourselves there too within our Germany healthcare business. And so, I see strong steady growth within Germany. But no changes yet to telemonitoring versus non-telemonitoring from reimbursement providers like in France. But if I was at the German ministry for health and looking at the success of France in driving increased adherence, low hospitalization costs and better outcomes for their patients and for the social security healthcare system within France. If I was next door in Germany, I'd be looking at that and saying why don't we keep up with the times and try to get ahead of them in digital health. Operator : Thank you. We are now at the one hour mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Ferrell. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Well, thanks, everybody. And in closing, I want to thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team for their dedication, focus and commitment to our operating excellence initiatives. This quarter, they have helped us deliver strong revenue growth and increasing operating leverage. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit our customers : patients, physicians, payers and providers. Thank you for your time and we will talk to you again after the end of our fiscal year in about 90 days plus or minus. Back to you, Tim. Operator : Thank you.

Operator : Welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2018 ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tim and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and welcome to ResMed's earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending June 30, 2018. This call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earning press release and our investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call following our prepared remarks. During our call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, however, actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders that are joining us today, as we review results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights and a few key announcements from the quarter. Then, I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. So, first, our top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of broad-based strong performance and I'd like to recognize the continued hard work that our 6,000-strong team has put in to achieve these results. Revenue once again grew by double digits, 12% on a headline basis and 10% on a constant currency basis, led by our sleep and respiratory care therapy businesses, performing well across global markets in both devices and masks. We also achieved good continued growth in our cloud-based Software-as-a-Service business. In addition to strong top line growth, our focus on operating leverage has resulted in continued bottom line success, with non-GAAP operating profit improving 19% year-over-year. Our efforts across the board from top line to bottom line performance resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.95. So, now some business highlights across our sleep and respiratory care business. Turning to a discussion of our business and its operations, so let's start with this part. We continue to pioneer and lead the industry in connected health and digital health. We now have over 8 million patients supported by our cloud-based patient management system called AirView and well over 5 million patients with 100% cloud-connected devices that are available for remote daily monitoring. In addition, over 1 million patients have signed up to access and review their own data with our personal patient engagement app called myAir. Our big data efforts to gather actionable information continued to increase exponentially and we now have over 2.5 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data in the cloud. These data support our efforts to analyze information and unlock value for our customers, enabling us to take action to better support home care providers, physicians, payers and ultimately, the most important customer, the patient. We continue our efforts to improve market access by working with payers across many geographies to improve reimbursement. Last quarter, we highlighted the revised reimbursement that went into effect in Japan during April. This resulted in our Japanese customers increasing their adoption of our cloud-connected devices. This increased activity continued in the fourth quarter and we saw another period of very strong sales in Japan. During the quarter, France continued to benefit from telemonitoring reimbursement incentives that went into effect last year. We expect year-over-year growth to return to normal patterns in France throughout fiscal 2019. Further, on the topic of reimbursement changes, our largest sleep apnea therapy geographies; the U.S., France, and Japan, getting beyond these and starting to look a little deeper. South Korea began reimbursing diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for sleep apnea during July. While the market size in South Korea is not nearly as big as the U.S., France, Japan or Germany, this is a really positive sign that our market access efforts are raising awareness and public health and the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea. Also, in July, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a proposed rule to make changes to the bidding and pricing methodologies under the competitive bidding program. Here are my two key takeaways : one, overall these changes will be a net positive for patients, for home care providers and for ResMed; and two, it's great that CMS is listening to industry advocates and responding to our concerns that have been impacting patients for many years. On the masks and accessories side of our business, in Q4, we had another very strong quarter, with global constant currency growth of 13% in the category. This was led by continued strong demand in our Europe and Asia markets, which grew a very strong 16% on a constant currency basis in masks and accessories. We are seeing continued good traction with our AirFit F20 full face mask and our AirFit N20 nasal mask products across all geographies. We're also encouraged by the success of our N20 Classic, which is positioned specifically for countries in Europe and is performing really well in those countries that we targeted. This is the validation of our approach to create unique solutions for specific geographies. The U.S., Canada and Latin America teams achieved very solid revenue growth of 12% in masks, driven by a continued success of the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 masks with patients, physicians and our home care providers. I'm proud of our team taking market share, growing ahead of the market in the U.S., Europe and Asia and globally. On the devices side of our business, we saw solid year-over-year constant currency growth of 8% globally, driven by strong growth in the U.S. of 9% on a year-over-year basis in devices. We continue to grow our device market share as healthcare providers and physicians are choosing and scripting ResMed, respectively, because of our quality, the sustainable value proposition of Air Solutions and the connected health and digital health outputs that come from Air Solutions, AirView, myAir, and the whole portfolio of cloud-based solutions that we have. Let's now turn to a discussion of our out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service businesses. This part of our business continues its trajectory of steady growth with revenue up 12% year-over-year. Brightree, which makes up the vast majority of this category, remains the top choice for home medical equipment companies, who use third-party software providers. Brightree's growth and leadership position in the health IT industry was recently recognized by Healthcare Informatics Magazine as a Top 100 Healthcare Information Technology Company for the fifth year in a row. I'm really proud of that part of our global ResMed team. We continue to invest in options for the future and to drive further growth in our Software-as-a-Service offerings. On July 9, we closed the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, a company offering electronic health record software, billing and coding services, as well as advanced analytics to both home health and hospice agencies. HEALTHCAREfirst enables these providers to optimize their clinical, financial and administrative processes, and we are proud to welcome the talented team from HEALTHCAREfirst to ResMed. Brightree also has home health and hospice and offerings that we think will combine very well with HEALTHCAREfirst. The HEALTHCAREfirst acquisition complements these existing solutions from Brightree and expands our footprint even further into the large and growing home health and hospice segments. These markets will continue to grow swiftly as an aging population shifts the lower cost out-of-hospital healthcare settings. The combination of Brightree and HEALTHCAREfirst capabilities will allow us to drive further enhancements and innovation for home health and hospice customers, ultimately increasing the business efficiency of our provider customers and improving outcomes for our patients. Now, let's discuss the progress we have made in executing on our operating excellence initiatives across the organization. We have delivered on our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit net operating profit improvement, and we're very pleased to once again deliver operating leverage to improve our bottom line. Non-GAAP income from operations improved 19% in the quarter, combining solid revenue growth and stable margin with very disciplined growth in SG&A, which grew by just 3% constant currency, and research and development, which grew at 6% constant currency. I want to reemphasize that our operating excellence initiatives are about the long-term. It's about working more efficiently, being focused and working smarter. We're taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach, and we will continue to invest in market-leading innovation across our businesses to continue to deliver strong organic growth. On that front, our product development teams continue to deliver meaningful product innovation. As I mentioned last quarter, we have just launched our brand new QuietAir technology that is part of our AirFit F20 full face mask and we're really pleased to see good customer response to this mask during the quarter, which continues to lead in the full face mask category over all our competitors. Last quarter, we also discussed the controlled launch of Mobi, the first ResMed-branded portable oxygen concentrator for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and for others who require oxygen therapy. We continue to gain insights and gather data on our go-to-market model for POCs. We are getting ready to scale this business. Tens of millions of COPD patients need our help and we are preparing to do just that. Now, for some business highlights in clinical research. A fundamental element of our mission here at ResMed is not only to deliver life-changing products and connected-health solutions to patients worldwide with sleep apnea, COPD and other severe respiratory and chronic disease conditions but to also spread awareness about these conditions and the availability of good diagnostic and treatment alternatives. As part of our efforts to raise awareness of sleep apnea and COPD, our medical affairs team focused its priorities to harness and analyze the over 2.4 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data available in our AirView cloud-based system. These big data-driven studies are producing important results that are worthy of publication in the peer-reviewed press and throughout medical conferences. ResMed is pioneering digital health research in order to drive better patient outcomes. During May, at the Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society, ResMed presented and supported over 18 studies in sleep apnea and COPD. We are not just leading the market in sleep apnea and COPD in terms of market share, but we're also leading with the best and top quality, world-class medical research. I won't go into details on this call of all these 18 studies; however, I'd like to mention a few that I believe highlight the importance of our products and services for all of our customers, from physicians to providers, to payers, and especially our most important customer, the patient. The first study relates to the global prevalence of sleep apnea. We convened a global team of leading researchers and key opinion leaders who looked at the prevalence studies from the many different countries around the world where they've been conducted. The team propensity-matched the population characteristics from these studies to calculate the new global prevalence estimate of 936 million people worldwide who have mild, moderate or severe sleep apnea. That is higher than the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and many other chronic disease conditions that are widely regarded as a global epidemic, and a public health crisis. If you remove the mild sleep apnea sufferers from the analysis, the experts estimate there are over 424 million people with moderate or severe sleep apnea. Considering this, we and others in our space have barely scratched the surface of this disease and its prevalence around the world. Sleep apnea remains a huge opportunity and a strategic imperative for ResMed. We have to raise awareness and get help for these people \u2013 hundreds of millions of people who are suffocating each night, we need to get them aware so they can get diagnosed and get treated. On that front, we have two joint venture investments that are driving sleep and sleep apnea awareness. In our joint venture that is called SleepScore Labs, and our brand new joint venture with Alphabet and the Verily arm of Alphabet that is a joint venture that was announced during the quarter. Through these types of partnerships, we plan to continue to invest to help identify, engage and enable the 936 million people with sleep apnea to find a path to diagnosis and world-leading connected health therapy from ResMed. The second study to highlight is an economic analysis that demonstrates the successful in-home combination of non-invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy versus oxygen therapy alone. Nick Hart (00:16:05) and his colleagues analyzed the economic impact of combining non-invasive ventilation and portable oxygen concentration and found that adding these two together saves money to the tune of $50,000 per quality of life adjusted year. That's an amazing result and we believe it will help drive adoption of the use of non-invasive ventilation. The third study I want to quickly mention relates to the patient benefits of the mask resupply program, which is a program to automate the process of resupplying masks by validating insurance, contacting the patient to determine if they need a new mask, fulfilling and then shipping that mask and then billing for it. Most insurance systems will let a patient receive a new mask two, three, or even four times per year. In a study of approximately 100,000 patients, half were on a resupply program and half were not. We demonstrated that for a patient on a resupply program, the likelihood of therapy termination after one year was reduced by more than 50% and there was a significant increase in the daily usage of PAP therapy among patients on resupply. These are meaningful outcomes and this demonstrates that resupply programs are an effective way to help patients achieve long-term adherence to therapy and thereby improve overall healthcare outcomes and lower healthcare costs. These three studies also demonstrate ResMed's commitment to support research from our over 2.5 billion nights of medical data to change the trajectory of two of the world's toughest and harshest chronic diseases, sleep apnea and COPD. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We had a great fiscal year 2018, ending June 30, and we finished the year with solid revenue growth and even stronger operating profit growth. ResMed is positioned well as we head into fiscal 2019. Our connected health strategy is advancing across multiple markets. We've seen continued success with our new mask and device products and we have a robust pipeline of new products and new connected health and digital health solutions. We are positioning ResMed for the long-term, driving top line and bottom line growth into 2020 and well beyond. We're going to execute on our strategy to lead the medtech field to create value with digital health solutions to slow chronic disease progression, to also reduce overall healthcare system costs, and most importantly, to improve outcomes and quality of life for our ultimate customer, the patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks on the finance in detail and then, we'll go over to Q&A. Brett, from Munich to Sydney, are you there? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $623.6 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $346.7 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $236.5 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. Sales in constant currency terms in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 9% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $189.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $156.8 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $162.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, a 6% increase. Masks and other sales were $74.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, a 16% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $40.4 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reform and an adjustment of foreign tax credits. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the June quarter was 58.1% compared with 58.2% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY 2018 gross margin. Moving to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $156.8 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 3%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 25.1% compared to the 26.6% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject of currency movements, we expect SG&A as a definitive revenue to be in the range of 24% to 25% for fiscal year 2019. Consistent with historical trends, Q1 FY 2019 will likely exceed this range, while the second half of the fiscal year is expected to track at the lower end of the range. R&D expenses for the quarter were $39.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared with 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.6 million for the quarter, the increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $166 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $136.3 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.95, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.76. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the stronger Australian dollar. As discussed during the previous call, we implemented a strategic global workforce review that was completed this quarter and resulted in a restructure expense of $7.5 million being recorded in our fourth quarter results. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter is 22.1%. As discussed during the previous quarter, we have recorded additional income tax expense of $126.6 million relating to newly enacted U.S. tax laws. This calculation is permitted to be provisional for 12 months after the enactment of the law. And as part of the current quarter activity, we further refined our calculations, which resulted in additional income tax expense of $5.8 million being recorded in our fourth quarter results. Additionally, we recorded a one-time charge of $7.2 million, reflecting the cumulative adjustment of our foreign tax credit position. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the one-time charges I've just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%. And now turning to guidance on our expected fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate. You will recall from last quarter, we have to take into account two offsetting impacts, unfavorable Australian tax reforms and favorable U.S. tax legislation along with estimates of the geographic attribution of our income. Taking into account these factors, we estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 24%. Cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter was $129.4 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $17.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $31.7 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $50 million. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, representing a 6% increase on our previously declared dividend. We also continued with our share buyback during the fourth quarter and repurchased 250,000 shares for consideration of $25.9 million. As Mick noted, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on our acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst. HEALTHCAREfirst revenue in calendar year 2017 was $29 million. At June 30, we have $281.5 million in gross debt and $92.8 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At June 30, total assets were $3.1 billion and net equity was $2.1 billion. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue. Tim, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Saul Hadassin with UBS is online with a question. Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. Good morning. Can you hear me? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: We can hear you loud and clear. It's actually good evening here, Saul, in Munich. Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Good evening. Good evening in Munich, Mick. Can I just ask about masks, particularly in the U.S.? So strong growth rate there. You mentioned market share \u2013 taking market share. Can you maybe comment a bit more on the contribution from growth in the resupply business? And cognizant that Brightree had some acquisitions during the year, the quarter as well, just in terms of the performance of ResMed resupply and Brightree, just how they are contributing to the resupply growth as evident in the mask growth rate this quarter? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely, Saul. We talk about sort of the devices growing in the mid-single digits and the masks growing at the high single-digits. And so clearly, 13% constant currency growth of our masks and accessories business in the U.S., kind of Latin America being 12% on a constant currency basis, we clearly took some share. And you saw in our sort of organic growth within the Brightree business, that was also in parallel actually a 12% on our Software-as-a-Service business. And clearly, that does through Brightree resupply and Brightree connected ResMed resupply, there are some combinations that are driving our share growth through not only first time set up of these great new masks, the N20 and the F20, but also through those resupply programs. So there's a combination of both of them coming into play into that really solid 12% growth number in the U.S. and really good global growth of 13% constant currency as well. Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks. So just one follow-up on that. Just the launch of QuietAir, how significant or how material was that? When did it come \u2013 actually, when was it rolled out during the quarter? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. So it was rolled out during the quarter. And as you know, Saul, our market is not uniform and so it's multiple contact points, over 3,000 contact points within just one geography, the U.S., and multiple in many of the markets that we go to through homecare providers. So it's account by account and doctor by doctor. They get to see it and start to write prescriptions for it and homecare providers start to adopt it. In our patient markets, like Australia and UK, you've got to get the word out and they've got a big social media drives and all that to get that technology there. But, look, I personally use one of these devices in QuietAir, the ability to have that level of noise reduction to well below the air conditioning \u2013 most QuietAir conditioning system in anyone's bedroom is incredible and a great advance. And I think this technology has lots more legs than just one quarter and we've got a lot of runway to go in QuietAir. But it was really just launched during this last quarter and so we've got a lot of runway ahead on that. Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. Thanks very much, Mick. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Saul. Operator : Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is online with a question. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good evening, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. First of all, I wanted to touch a little bit on the device growth that we saw internationally. Can you give any more color in terms of how big of an impact Japan had? Are you seeing more patients getting diagnosed or are you seeing more fleet upgrades? And how should we think about that benefit over the next kind of 12 to 18 months (00:31:10) Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Margaret, thanks for the question. Look, we had some really good growth in devices in Europe, Asia and our global markets, 6% on the constant currency basis and actually even better growth within U.S., Canada, Latin America of 9%. We had the benefits of the changes in reimbursements in both Japan and France, which are the sort of S curves of growth that we've been talking about over the last number of quarters and those Ss will start to taper off as we talked about, but those devices that are now set up are 100% cloud-connected. And if you go back to the study I referred to in the prepared remarks, if you have a resupply program and if a patient has cloud connectivity, you start to get adherence rates in 80% range, just in cloud-connected and using myAir. And then, you add on the resupply program, which leads to even greater adherence. That combination we think will be powerful to be able to drive long-term mask and accessory growth across that patient group. So if you like, getting a connected device in there is the gift that keeps on giving. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, just to follow up with a similar question, in the U.S., obviously, the U.S. device number ended up being quite strong again. And so I think, generally, when you talk to investors, they'll be surprised that you continue to take share, you continue to see strong underlying market growth. So are you seeing existing DMEs or maybe already ResMed purchasers buying more of them? Are you seeing more of the fleets moving towards ResMed? Are you seeing that incremental buyer come in and say, I'm going to standardize on ResMed? Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the follow-up, Margaret. Look, I think it's a combination of a little bit of all the above. If our devices are able to save you 50% labor cost on setting up the devices, it's really \u2013 you have Adam Smith's invisible hand helping you choose ResMed at the homecare provider level. And if you're a physician and writing prescriptions and you can do this AirView based management by exception and automated connectivity and follow-up with your patients through the Air Solutions platform and particularly through AirView, then you're going to write more prescriptions for our product. So it's both of the above. And look, I do think, to your third point, we are betting on the winners. The people that are adopting ResMed's cloud-connected devices are the ones that are taking share in their geographies, whether it's the Southeast in the United States or whether it's Western France, and now in Japan. And so, I don't think that this is the end of it. I think this is the start of it. And as we said in the prepared remarks as well, Margaret, we're not satisfied with the current market growth, particularly with these new prevalence numbers showing over 900 million people with sleep apnea. We think that our partnership with Alphabet and Verily, and our partnership with Pegasus Capital and Dr. Oz to just drive awareness of sleep and then specifically sleep apnea so that we get more patients into the diagnostic and therapeutic funnel is a strategic imperative for ResMed. And we're not going to accept not being able to drive that market growth rate up as well as continue to take share. Operator : Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on the line with a question. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Thanks again for the question. Just a few contribution questions in the quarter. Just wondering what acquisition contributed there and maybe just an update on Mobi, as that's under controlled launch and what your expectations are perhaps into the fourth quarter for Mobi? Maybe once it's under a full launch in 2019, how big of a market opportunity do you see Mobi and what does the margin profile for that product look like? Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Anthony, thanks for the two questions. I'll take them in reverse order. I'll take the Mobi question and hand the contribution question over to Brett in Sydney. But, yeah, look, I know that here in Germany healthcare \u2013 ResMed healthcare office here in Germany, and there's really a great market and is biggest economy in Europe for portable oxygen concentrators. And so we think long-term, there is a really exciting opportunity globally for ResMed with portable oxygen concentrators. Our controlled launch is really focused in the U.S. primarily and it's about our go-to-market model. When you talk about market potential, look, there are a number of players in this space. We're not alone in having a portable oxygen concentrator. What I think we bring to the table is the ResMed brand, ResMed quality, reliability, the awareness amongst pulmonary doctors of our brand name. And I do think that will contribute a lot to the prescriptions that we've started to get and will continue to get with Mobi. But as I said in the prep remarks and you alluded to there, Anthony, we're doing a controlled launch and then we will go to a stronger, larger launch as we refine that go-to-market model. So throughout FY 2019, 2020 and beyond, you're going to see ResMed be a major player in the global portable oxygen concentrator market. And it won't just be having a device that filters nitrogen. Its' going to be a device that's smart, that moves with the patient and is mobile, is small, quite, comfortable, high-quality oxygen output and also, ultimately, a system that'll have connectivity and will link up to Air Solutions and all the value that we provided in digital health across the rest of our business. Brett, do you want to take the first part of Anthony's question about contributions from organic versus inorganic? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Mick, thank you. Anthony, we've got \u2013 I mean we've made a couple of tiny acquisitions over FY 2018. So in terms of group results, it was really pretty much de minimis in terms of their contribution. It's pretty much organic growth that you're seeing. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Thanks again. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Anthony. Operator : Joanne Wuensch is on the line with BMO Capital Markets with the question. Unknown Speaker : This is Steve (00:37:31) on of Joanne. Can you guys hear me okay? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Can hear you loud and clear, Steve. (00:37:35) Unknown Speaker : Awesome. Hey, I appreciate some of the early commentary on the HEALTHCAREfirst integration and just piggybacking on the last question. But can you talk about some of the strategy behind combining it with the Brightree offering and maybe some of the revenue and cost synergies we should be focused on in the long-term? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: So, really, HEALTHCAREfirst, I mean, as Brett said, it was de minimus. I mean, we only really just closed it recently and so there was no sort of revenue impact in the numbers that we talked about in FY 2018. But as we look forward, and as Brett indicated in the prep remarks, it's about $30 million run rate trailing revenue in this business and we expect that to grow pretty fast. The home health and hospice sectors of out-of-hospital care are very fast growing. We've got an aging population. People want to age in place. They don't want to be in hospital. They don't want to be in an acute care setting. And so we're really seeing great growth \u2013 just secular growth within those two segments. And HEALTHCAREfirst has an excellent offering and Brightree home health and hospice has an excellent iPad app and capability and really user friendly for the home nurses and the folks that are walking around hospice agencies and traveling around to people's homes for the home nursing and home health. So we are really excited about the strategic combination of those two parts of our business and we have some really strong leadership that have experience at much larger companies within this space. And we're very excited about those sectors. So you're going to see ResMed invest for organic and inorganic growth across the out-of-hospital software part of our business. Unknown Speaker : Okay, great. And just as a quick follow-up, just a competitive question, now that we have sort of one more quarter under your belt, have you guys seen any further impact from the masks from Philips? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I mean we don't go into details around other than the fact that we're taking share versus our competitors, but I might hand to Jim Hollingshead to give a little more detail. He's President of our Global Sleep business. He can maybe talk a little bit about the innovation of N20 and F20 and how they're beating the competition and how that works. Jim? James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. See, as Mick says, we don't go into details about specific \u2013 really, in general about our competitor shares, specific competitive products. I'll just say that we feel very comfortable with our mask portfolio. The whole portfolio continues to perform very well both in the U.S. and in global markets. The F20 full face mask is performing extremely well and continues to be in a very strong leadership position in the market with the QuietAir vent adding to that offering. And we're very confident in our portfolio. Unknown Speaker : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : David Bailey from Macquarie is on the line with a question. David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Yes. Good morning. It's David from Macquarie. Just my first question is in relation to Mobi in portable oxygen concentration. Seen some of your competitors looking to employing a direct-to-consumer strategy. You've previously said you're looking at partnering with the HME channel in terms of your own strategy. Can you just talk through how you plan to go about things on the go-forward basis in the POC space? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. And as you mentioned, there are a couple of competitors doing a variety of different go-to market models. Our goal is, we really like our U.S. homecare provider customers. The HME is a great customer base we partnered with for decades to help grow this market. And they have the best people to start working on reimbursement models and to understand Medicare reimbursement and private care reimbursement for POCs. And so we're really partnering with them on that. And we're also partnering with them on the best way to get the product to patients who want to pay cash. And so you'll see us work with the channel and help support them with many different models in this space. But rather than \u2013 because I'm sure our competitors will be reading this transcript or listening live to go into the details of that go-to-market model. I'll just say that our model is going to be more partnership with the channel than that what we're seeing, I think, from some others is competition with the channel. I just don't think that's a smart move. I think you want to partner and understand how you can grow as you have for a number of decades other parts of the business like our sleep apnea franchise that we've grown incredibly well with our U.S. HME partners and our French homecare providers, and our Japanese homecare providers and grow in those spaces. And so, obviously, every market in the world is different. We have different go-to-market models in Germany or Australia, New Zealand. But I think your question was about the U.S. market where our focus is partnership with the HME channel and helping both of us win. And additionally, really most importantly, helping that patient win and get access to ResMed's POC if they want to. David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: That's great. Thanks. That's very clear. And just a follow-up from me. Just in terms of resupply in some of the new markets that you've entered, France and Japan, the U.S. obviously eligible for full mask to run. (00:42:59) How does the resupply criteria or eligibility criteria in the rest of world compared to what you see in the United States? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, David. It's a good question. Let's talk about the resupply side of our business. In the U.S., every payer operates differently. There are some private payers that is two full mask systems per year, 10 or more cushions per year. There's some that are three full mask systems and even some that are four full masks systems. I think what it's really about is checking in with the patient because you want to make sure that that patient wants the new mask, is ready for a new mask and is engaged in this therapy. And, David, as you heard me say in the prep remarks, when you engage with the patient around a resupply program and you're checking with them, do you want to be email, do you want to be text, do you want to be a live call. And you ask them, how, when and where they want to find that out, and to what level do we partner with the channel to check on reimbursement and to help them provide shipping and follow-up care to that patient. We're seeing really good growth of that resupply business. So, look, it's a long-term play. I think you saw in the quarter really good mask growth from us not just in the U.S., but also in Europe. Every market is different. You actually find sometimes in patient pay markets like Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, and UK, that patients are even more active in working with the adherence models because it's their own mask and they get to choose when they want it. But the really important thing is, ask the patient, get in touch with them, and we're seeing really good success as you saw in the quarter there. David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: That's great. Thanks for the detail. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator : David Low with JPMorgan is online with a question. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. If I could just start with the restructuring, so we saw another round of restructuring going through, just if I could get you to comment on whether that's now complete. And then, sort of to the operating leverage, which has been such a strong driver of earnings in recent times, is a lot of what you're seeing going forward \u2013 going forward in the guidance reflecting the benefit from that restructuring or there a broader opportunity on the operating leverage front? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I'll hand the first part of question over to Brett, who will talk about the restructuring and then maybe, Brett, you can have a go with the operating leverage and hand back to me or anyone else in the team you think appropriate. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Yeah, Dave, we \u2013 I mean, we've got \u2013 that's sort of like the global restructure was in Q3 and we did flag up that we'd have this final charge coming through into Q4. So that's essentially that one that's completed. And then, probably you sort of see some of that benefit from the Q3 restructuring, I guess, coming through. But that was really around strategically looking at kind of where we wanted to balance resources and so on, what we felt we needed to invest in. So it's a much broader picture in terms of what we're trying to do. If you look at the kind of operating leverage, we're pretty committed on that and we're really looking to see how we can do things smarter, or how we can do them differently. And then, really, looking at how can we achieve scale, and then as we grow revenues, grow SG&A at a lower clip than that. So there's a lot we're doing there, a lot we're doing around business excellence program and things like that. We're really trying to make sure that we're operating as efficiently as we can. But I don't want you to feel \u2013 we're really cognizant that we'll be continuing to invest for the long-term sustainable growth in the business, so we won't back off that whatsoever. We do think we can manage in terms of efficiencies and scale and then kind of how we deliver particularly around kind of back office, if you like. So we're continuing that program, but the aim is to support the long-term sustainable growth. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Okay, great. I mean, I might just switch topics. The sales line was pretty much where we expected and clearly very strong across masks in the U.S. The one part that was a little softer to my mind was the device sales outside the U.S., Europe and Asia, particularly in light of the commentary that we heard about France and Japan being strong, Korea perhaps a bit earlier stage. But is there anything else across the region that would explain if France and Japan was strong? Why perhaps 6% growth was \u2013 is certainly down a bit on what we saw in Q3. Just wondering if there's anything else happening in other markets perhaps? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. And we did flag this last quarter when we saw pretty strong outside U.S. device growth in that high single, low double digits last quarter. And what we said was that some of the step-up like in Japan, where it's a fleet sale to Japanese home care providers based upon that telemonitoring chain that it would be sort of a one to one and a half quarter effect. And so, I think you're seeing that Japan \u2013 in and Japan out element from Q3 to Q4. But, look, 6% growth in devices in Europe, Asia and around the world is a really solid number. I mean you're talking mid- to single digits growth globally in that space normally and ResMed grew at 8%, so well above global market growth. And as we said we had a little bit of benefit additionally in France, but most of that is starting go away and we're starting to get back towards those organic growth rates in Europe, Asia and others. So I think it's a natural return to market growth and then some additional market share taking for those who still are switching over to the cloud-connected devices in France and to a much lesser extent in Japan. But, look, the real benefit, as I was alluding to in one of the earlier questions, is not just selling that one device and then resupplying that every three or five years based on patient upgrade or warranty models. It's really around the fact that a patient now on a cloud-connected device in a region where cloud connectivity is used a lot, like France, Japan and obviously, the U.S., is something that starts to drive really strong and sustainable mask and accessory resupply. And so that's really the benefit that we're sort of highlighting with these great telemonitoring tools. Yes, there's some great one to two quarter benefits in device sales, but most importantly, it's a patient whose life has changed. And therefore, when you ask them, text them, call them, do you want a new mask three months or four months or six months later, they say, yes, because you're contacting them the way they wanted and how they wanted and they're getting part of that resupply program. So it's good for everyone, then the payer because patients go in hospital, the patient because they're getting great care, and the provider because they're able to provide that extra mask and obviously for ResMed. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thomas Yeo is on the line with Goldman Sachs, Sydney, with a question. Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, in regards to the recent CMS proposed rules, could you help us understand a few of the potential changes that is happening? Like, how is a lead product being defined? And also, what do you expect the change in proposed rules to have on the different mask categories? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: So I'll hand that to Dave Pendarvis, who is with me here in Munich, regarding reimbursement CMS. David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. We're pleased with the CMS proposal. As Mick mentioned earlier, we think it's going to be overall good for the industry. And the first thing I would point to there is that they've moved to the clearing price, establishing the reimbursed amount. And that in and of itself is something the industry has been asking for quite a while, and so that should be strong. There is some discussion in there about lead product and categories. And so it remains to be seen how much of that will come out in the final rule and how much of it will be handled by sub-regulatory guidance down the road, but we do think that if sleep is a separate category from oxygen, that's a good thing for our sleep business. Remains to be seen whether non-invasive ventilation would be a different category or combined with others. So that will have to come out in the final rules and guidance thereafter, but we do think that our focus on sleep overall is a good thing. And as a overall measure, what we really like about this is that the industry has been talking for some time about the need for change in the way this competitive bidding structure was operating. And CMS has responded. You have to give them credit for listening to the industry, working with the industry, and not just us but others throughout the whole industry have been participating in this process. So we have to give credit where credit is due. Now, there's still some things we'd like to see on top of that. I mean, the fact that in some of the non-competitive bid areas, a town like Niland, California, which is near the Salton Sea, or a small county that's outside of Chicago is viewed as no uplift, not really considered a rural area, we think that's an area where CMS ought to step in and provide some additional reimbursement. So there's always room to improve. The industry is still looking for improvement here, but overall, we think it's a good positive development. Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Thanks. And just a follow-up and kind of to switch topic as well, what's the progress being made in COPD? We have seen some supportive studies lately. Could you outline which of those are underway today and what you expect to be the most impactful and when do you expect them to read out? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I'll hand that question to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer, who is in San Diego. Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Thomas. So, yeah, there's been quite a few studies on and some of them were actually previewed in posters at ATS, but there were studies really looking at various sectors. The main one we've been talking about is the HOT-HMV study, which showed the benefit in terms of keeping people out of hospital by adding NIV on to oxygen. And then, as Mick mentioned earlier, that really had an economic study done to it, which showed a very significant cost reduction per quality of life here that you almost never see in treatment. So that should be really powerful. Other studies are ongoing. There were studies looking at really getting at identifying, which patients are going to benefit more and understanding how to get out and predict the patients that have high CO2 levels, which is really the patients that benefit the most from the addition of NIV treatment. It's a very fertile ground. Around the world, standards of care are still quite varied and there's a lot of opportunity for those to be normalized as these studies bear fruit, both from the benefit of oxygen, integrated or not with NIV therapy and then models of using them. There's a lot coming. Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Thank you, and good morning or good evening. I have a question on AllCall connect. I'm just wondering, Mick, if you give us a bit of granularity around that. Like, how broadly is it adopted? How much of a driver in a broad \u2013 sort of the good resupply number as a start? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So, Sean, look, there's a portfolio of offerings in resupply. Within the Brightree Core, we had Brightree Connect and then we had our ResMed ReSupply model and then we had added onto that, which are both sort of automated, if you like, cloud-based AI type algorithms, ML type algorithms to contact patients. In addition, we added AllCall Connect, which is live humans as well as automated levels. And so, now we've got a portfolio of live and automated calling for people. And I'll go back to my comments a little earlier that it's really about finding the best solution for a patient as they need it. And AllCall is really just part of that portfolio. We don't break out how much is from the Brightree, how much is from the ResMed, which is for users of ResMed beyond just Brightree users, and how much is part of the AllCall. But what I can tell you is they're really well-coordinated on the back end and there's a skin, so it's pretty much invisible to the frontend users and patients won't actually know what back end system they're using. The others say, wow, ResMed is reaching out to me or we may even do it on behalf of DME A or B (00:56:01) and reach out to the patient. So, really, we're seeing a good growth across the portfolio of those. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Okay. Thanks, Mick. And just one quick follow-up just to check a number. On HEALTHCAREfirst, there was no contribution in the current fiscal year and there was about trailing 12-month revenue of $30 million, if I heard correctly. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. The trailing 12-month is around $29 million, $30 million. Brett, no real material contribution, correct? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: No, we closed that sales (00:56:29) in the quarter and, Sean, I think, it was on 9th of July. So just had it for three weeks. So, certainly no impact in Q4, but obviously that's a \u2013 we think it's a really good growth area. So we've got good expectations at both the Brightree and the HEALTHCAREfirst offerings in that space. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Perfect. Thank you, gentlemen. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean. Operator : John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup is online with a question. John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Good morning. I was just wanting to turn to Brightree for a moment. Could you just give us a sense \u2013 obviously, strong growth numbers, a sense of the growth between new customers and existing customers spending more money with you? What's the rough split? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. John, we don't go into that much detail on it. Jim, who runs our global sleep business probably has a little more color that he can provide qualitatively. We're not sort of going to breakout per user per month type growth that we have as customers grow and/or take share and/or acquire other customers. But, Jim, do you want to provide any further color on Brightree and how we achieved those strong 12% growth numbers in the quarter. James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Sure, Mick, and thanks, John, for your question. Without getting into granular detail, we're getting growth on both sides of that equation and not just out of Brightree, of course, but out of other offerings in the SaaS portfolio. So it's pretty balanced growth. John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Maybe just a change text, you called out early in the call the prevalence of sleep apnea. What was the actual severe number? Do you have that separately because obviously it's quite important? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I just want to do some \u2013 I actually don't know if that study does break it out. And if so, we're really happy to share that with you, John. But what doctors call mild is an AHI or suffocation index of 5 to 14. So with 14, that's approximately just over every four minutes of sleep that you suffocate for 10-plus, minimum of 10 seconds. Every four minutes of sleep, 10 seconds suffocation, that's called mild. And if you talk about moderate, what doctors call moderate sleep apnea, which is an AHI of 15 to 30, and you're pushing 30, that's every two minutes now, you're suffocating for 10 seconds or more. That's called moderate. So, I think there's a difference between what doctors call moderate sleep apnea. And if you talk to a patient, say, hey, you're suffocating every two minutes, but don't worry, your doctor says that's moderate, but you're suffocating for every four minutes, but don't worry, your doctor says that's mild. This is what it is. To be called severe, you have to suffocate every \u2013 less than every 120 seconds of sleep for more than 10 seconds. You're starting to get close to 10% of your time in suffocation mode. So I don't know, look, I'm a mild sleep apnea sufferer and I use this device. Obviously, I'm passionate it as CEO of the company. But many people with mild sleep apnea are seeking treatment and don't want to suffocate. You don't wait till you really overweight before you start exercising, why would you wait until your suffocation index is every 110 seconds. But anyway, I'll hand over to Rob, if he wants to handle any further information about the severe element of that study. Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Just one other bit of information, John, the reimbursement programs around the world would \u2013 may distinguish between mild and severe. And so in many U.S. models, you need a comorbidity and mild to get reimbursed, which is most people do have comorbidity, so it's very common, or just having it moderate or mild get you into it. So that's really why we focus more on the difference between mild and moderate versus severe. John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Understand. That's very helpful. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for your questions, John. Operator : We have Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee on the line with a question. Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: Thanks very much. Lucky, last, I think quickly on ASP, I know you've sort of talked about in masks business a bit, but you did talk about ASP declines. Was that regionally based, was it a European or U.S. feature? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. We don't get into details on ASP, but it was pretty steady changes globally, Andrew. So, nothing really different from the last eight to 12 quarters we've been talking about this. Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: Okay. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Pretty steady. Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: Okay. So, no particular region where you're feeling competitive or other sort of changing pressure? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: No, look, we've been going through a lot of details about U.S. reimbursement, how \u2013 actually, there were some really good news on the competitive bidding front in terms of where they came to in this quarter. So I think we're seeing pretty steady levels of ASPs in terms of those decline rates being steady over the last eight, 12 quarters. There's really nothing dramatic happening there. Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: And a quick on Narval. In France, we're hearing that's doing quite well. Just I guess any color on how that's going? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I'm here over with the European team and I got to tell you, there's a lot of passion for our 3D printed medical device there with the Narval. I mean it's just a fantastic mandibular repositioning device and the reimbursement actually increased by over 30% in France with some recent changes for Narval. And it's a really well-run operation We have the 3D printers in Lyon. We have incredibly strong sales team and really aware sleep and dental sleep specialists and good relationships between the pulmonary and dental sleep medicine specialists. So, yeah, we are seeing strong growth. We don't break that out, obviously, by the numbers there, Andrew, but if you're doing your channel checks, I think you'll find that ResMed is not only the number one supplier of CPAP, APAP and bilevel for sleep apnea. They're also the number one supplier of MRDs for treatment of sleep apnea within France. Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: Perfect. Thank you very much. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks Andrew. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Mick Ferrell. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Tim. And look, as we close the call here, I want to once again thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team in 120 countries for their continued dedication, focus and commitment to our growth strategy and our operating excellence initiatives. Throughout the entire fiscal year 2018, you've helped us deliver strong revenue growth and increased our operating leverage. And as we exit fiscal 2018 and we're now here in a positive trajectory as we start fiscal 2019. We remain focused as a team on our future pipeline of pretty amazing products and software solutions that change patients' lives, to improve patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, the physicians, the payers, the providers, and of course, the patients.

Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 ResMed, Inc., Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. You may begin. Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. As Chris said, this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the press release and our updated Investor Presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. I'd like to highlight that we have made a few enhancements to our press release this quarter. We've summarized key information to make it easier to locate and analyze. We have provided some additional commentary regarding our results and we've included supplemental revenue information, which had previously been posted separately to our website. We hope these changes are helpful as you analyze our results. We're always looking to improve our disclosure and welcome any feedback you may have. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call following our prepared remarks. During our call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's earnings release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today, as we review results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights and a few key announcements from the quarter. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. So, first, the top level financial results, we started the new fiscal year right where we left off the old one with another quarter of strong and balanced performance across our portfolio. My personal thanks go out to our global team. It is the hard work and dedication of more than 6,000 ResMedians that has allowed us to continue to deliver these strong results. Global revenue grew by double digits, 12% headline and 13% on a constant currency basis. Our ongoing focus on business efficiencies as well as tech investments has resulted in continued bottom line improvements, with non-GAAP net income improving 23% year-over-year. These efforts at the top line and the bottom line resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.81. So that is 23% growth in Q1 EPS versus this time last year. So now some business highlights across our global fleet and our global respiratory care business. So, turning to a discussion about business operations, let's start with these core businesses. We are the world's leading connected health and digital health technology company with well over 8 million patients supported by our cloud-based patient management system called AirView and well over 6 million patients with 100% cloud connectable devices that are available for remote daily monitoring. Over the past 12 months, we have improved their lives by delivering physical products to over 14 million people, delivering products to treat their sleep apnea and/or their chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And we are well on our way to achieving our long-term goal of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Our digital health technology is turning big data into actionable insights for patients, physicians, homecare providers and beyond. We now have over 3 billion nights of medical sleep and medical COPD data in the cloud and the growth is exponential. Everything we do supports our ambition to help the more than 936 million people worldwide, who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and the over 400 million people worldwide, who suffer from lung disease. As we seek to treat their chronic diseases and help them, really importantly stay out of hospital, with a high quality of life in their own home. Our efforts to improve market access by communicating the clinical and economic efficacy of our solutions with payors, payor providers and governments are achieving results in geographies around the world. There have been significant changes over the past 12 to 18 months in digital health reimbursement in the United States, in France, and in Japan. This is not random and this is just the beginning. Based on the smaller, quieter and more comfortable technology, within our AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms and the digital health and connected health solutions of our cloud based Air Solutions platform, we continue to take share with device sales that remain very strong. Last quarter, we discussed the proposed rule issued by CMS regarding changes to logistics and pricing methodologies under the competitive bidding program in the U.S. We expect the final rule to come out sometime in early to mid-November. Based on our assessment of what is happening in Washington D.C., our key takeaway points remain the same. One, we believe the changes overall will be a net positive for patients, the home care provider industry, and for ResMed. And two, we are pleased that CMS is sincerely listening to industry advocates and seems to be responding to our concerns and the concerns that we have for patients and the community. On the devices side of our business, we delivered another solid quarter with year over year global constant currency growth of 14% powered by strong growth of 20% in Europe, Asia and the rest of world, and solid 9% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies. During August, we introduced an upgrade to our Astral life support ventilator platform and have seen good adoption since the launch of that Astral platform. This is now added and compounded to the digital health powered growth of the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 devices. The controlled product launch of our Mobi portable oxygen concentrator is going very well and we expect to move to a full product launch next quarter as we lock down our go to market model. We are working in full partnership with our HME customers to grow this category. We think that's the best strategy and the one that helps not only home care providers but most importantly the patients. We continue to build device \u2013 our market share as healthcare providers and physicians around the world are choosing ResMed devices not just for their intrinsic designed in quality but also for the sustainable value proposition of the digital health solutions we offer as part of our ecosystem. These solutions are literally upgraded every few weeks as new versions of AirView, myAir, the Brightree platform and HEALTHCAREfirst cloud-based software are released. We will continue to evolve and enhance our solutions to meet ongoing patient, physician, payor, and home care provider needs. We believe this will continue to drive future ResMed success. The masks and accessories side of our business grew 10% in constant currency globally during the quarter, led by a very strong demand in the U.S., Canada and Latin America geographies which grew at 11% on a constant currency basis. We are seeing continued good traction with our AirFit F20 on the full face side and our AirFit N20 on the nasal side across all geographies. During the quarter, we launched our brand new AirFit F30, an amazing innovation in the minimal-contact full face mask category. It's our first play in this category of product. With the F30, we have expanded our mask portfolio to offer even more options for home care providers and ultimately for the very needs of individual patients. By keeping our innovation laser-focused on under-met and unmet customer needs, we will achieve continued growth of ResMed masks throughout fiscal year 2019 and beyond. So, let's now turn to a discussion of our Software as a Service global business. This business continues its trajectory of growth with revenue up 25% year-on-year driven by continued expansion of Brightree, but also incremental contribution from the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, which closed early in Q1. We are revolutionizing healthcare delivery through a smart connected ecosystem that provides superior outcomes for patients and for homecare providers. We have been working on some pretty important enhancements of our out-of-hospital medical software business over the last few years. Let me cover some recent highlights in the last few quarters. We recently commenced a controlled launch of our Brightree Advanced Analytics platform. This data analytics platform leverages advanced analytics technology and filtering capabilities to offer a scalable data solution for homecare providers. We help customers better manage their business from an aggregate perspective and also provide the ability to easily drill down into the details to drive business efficiency. Ultimately, this will free up cash flow and clinician time, which will lead to better patient care. We also recently introduced two new apps for customers. First, the BrightreeCARE app for home health and hospice aides, as well as the Patient Hub app, which is designed for home medical equipment providers. The BrightreeCARE app enables home health and hospice aides to easily document their visits in the home on their own smart device without having to carry additional equipment. This provides mobility, flexibility and efficiency to our customers. We think it's going to help drive home health and hospice market share growth for our Brightree franchise. Patient Hub is a patient engagement app that automates and simplifies how HME providers connect with their patients into one secure platform. This effectively eliminates the need for multiple Web portals and sign-ons and consolidates all patient interactions including appointment reminders, insurance updates, order placement, and delivery status. By improving ease of engagement and automation, the Patient Hub app empowers care providers, frees up resources and creates opportunities to accelerate cash flow for our HME customers. We will continue to invest in these and other technologies to expand our Software-as-a Service portfolio offering. There will be strong ongoing organic growth as well as opportunities for acquisition-driven growth within the United States and also certain geographies that we're looking at in Europe and in Asia. Now let's discuss the progress we have made executing on our global business excellence initiatives across the organization. We have delivered yet another quarter of double-digit net operating profit improvement. That's the fifth quarter in a row. We are pleased to again drive operating leverage to improve the bottom line of our business. Non-GAAP income from operations improved 26% in the quarter, combining solid revenue growth and stable gross margin with disciplined investment in SG&A, which grew by just 4% in constant currency in the quarter and research and development investments, which grew at 8% in constant currency during the quarter. I want to reemphasize that our business excellence initiatives are about the long term, working more efficiently, leveraging new tech tools, improving global processes, and working smarter. We are taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach and we will continue to invest in R&D for our business and deliver strong organic growth and operating leverage. We have proven that these two value growth engines, organic growth and operating leverage, are not mutually exclusive. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We have had a great start to the new fiscal year and we are well-positioned to grow throughout FY 2019 and beyond. The continued success of our current mask and device portfolio along with the solid pipeline of new products and enhanced connected health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and out of hospital medical software markets give us confidence in ongoing momentum as we move throughout the year. We have positioned the company for the long-term, driving top- and bottom-line growth into 2020 and beyond as we execute on our strategy to continue to lead the med tech field in digital health to create value with connected health and to achieve what we call our Triple Aim, which is : one, to slow chronic disease progression; two, to reduce overall healthcare system costs; and three, most importantly to improve the outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer in our industry, our patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks. And then, we will go to Q&A. Brett? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $588.3 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 13%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $326.4 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $214.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $172.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $154 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $151.7 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 20%. Masks and other sales were $62.7 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 6%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 14%, while masks and other sales increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the first quarter was $47.5 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year quarter. This includes the contribution from our HEALTHCAREfirst acquisition that closed on July 6. Excluding HEALTHCAREfirst, Software-as-a-Service revenue grew in the high single digits. As you heard from Mick earlier, we've recently introduced several new SaaS offerings and expect future growth opportunities over the coming quarters and fiscal years based on our expanded platforms and our ongoing innovations. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reforms. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 58.3% compared with 58.4% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. On a sequential basis, our gross margin improved by 20 basis points over Q4 FY 2018. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q1 FY 2019 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.3 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25% compared to the 27.5% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be within the range of 24% to 25% for fiscal year 2019. R&D expenses for the quarter was $38.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis an increase of 8%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% as compared with 7.1% in the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be within the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019. Amortization of the acquired intangibles was $12.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $157 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter; while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $116.3 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.81, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rates for the September quarter was 23.9%; while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%. We continue to estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 24%. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $48.1 million. This included tax payments of $125 million in the current quarter, compared to $30.2 million in the same period of the prior year. Excluding the tax payments, our cash flow from operations was $173.1 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $30.4 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $52.8 million. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, and we continued our share buyback during the September quarter and repurchased 200,000 shares for consideration of $22.8 million. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, for cash consideration of $126.3 million. With respect to our recently announced joint venture with Verily, we have now received all required regulatory approvals and expect to commence operations during our second quarter. We will provide an update of the likely operating costs associated with the JV in our second quarter earnings call. At September 30, we have $530 million in gross debt and $299 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.1 billion and net equity was $1.9 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thanks, Brett. Let's now turn to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question. If you do have additional questions, please feel free to hop back into the queue. Chris, we're now ready to go ahead and start the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs is online with a question. Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Hi. Good morning, good afternoon. I'll state my one question. Just on European masks please, I think the 6% number that we saw was just a little bit larger than we've seen lately, and I appreciate you have potentially a pretty strong comp. I'll be just curious to hear if you could talk to some of the drivers around what's driven that number and specifically as well, I'll be curious to hear if you could comment on what sort of impact you've seen in terms of share from your competitors' full face mask that was launched, I guess, back in April now. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question, Chris. And yeah, we're really quite proud of the global and constant currency growth, the 10% on masks, 11% in U.S. and Canada, 6% in Europe, Asia and others is maybe just around sort of the market growth range. I think our comp was around the sort of 10%, 15% from a year ago quarter. And so as you noted there was a very, very strong comp there. Look, we've just launched new masks into this marketplace. The QuietAir technology was launched just maybe six plus months ago. The F30 is only just hitting global markets at this point. And so, Europe tends to take longer for technologies to permeate through the different countries and each different countries have different reimbursement models. It's not the United States of Europe. So, we have to work through sort of the 26 models of reimbursement and how masks are provided there. I do think there's opportunity to drive more resupply of masks throughout many of our European countries, and so there's systemic and digital health driven methodologies that we can use to drive the whole market number up there. But if you're asking if I'd like to see 6% be closer to 10%, the answer is absolutely. Do I think it's a good quarter from our European team with 20% growth on devices and 6% growth on masks? Absolutely. But I know there's room for improvement there, and we'll certainly be working with Tim Hoyes and (00:26:04) the global team and the Western European, Northern European and Eastern European leaders to make sure that we can move that number up as we move forward throughout FY 2019 and beyond. (00:26:17) Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: ...just to clarify, I mean, it's more of a \u2013 the fact that the market growth exceeds beyond that level, you're not seeing yourself lose any momentum to your new competitors? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think we're losing share in the European marketplace. I think there's opportunities to grow that market growth number, but I don't think we're losing share at that point, but I think we should be taking share with the F30 and the QuietAir technology. And so I'd like to see that number push closer to the double digits, Chris. Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for your question. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Wong Pan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Hi. Just wanted to ask about your rest of world device growth, I mean, that was quite strong. Could you just talk to what are the main drivers behind that? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Craig, good question. So that's the 20% Europe, Asia and other markets growth. Yeah, incredibly strong. We did see continued benefits in countries like France as we see the digital health technology and reimbursement changes that have happened there and there's a good strong tail to that upgrade, if you like, from non-cloud connectable to cloud connectable devices across France. But I'm going to tell you across the other 25 countries in Europe and across many of the countries in Asia, we saw just a really strong quarter in our device business. It's powered by the digital health technology. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, you've seen actual reimbursement changes in the U.S. and in France and in Japan and certainly they're providing some power behind the growth, but in many other countries where reimbursement hasn't yet caught up to the technology, the technology itself is lowering the setup cost of our therapy by 50% and improving the adherence rate from industry standard, 50%, 60% like pharmaceutical medicines up to 80%, 87% in some of the published data that we have out there. So that's the real power behind it, and we think there's a lot of legs to it. Certainly, some elements like the upgrade from non-cloud connectable to connectable has a time limit to it, but the digital health tail of lowering costs and improving adherence, which improves outcomes, we think has a much longer runway, and so we're excited about that opportunity to continue our Europe, Asia and global growth in devices. Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Sorry, can I just clarify on France, I thought last quarter you were mentioning that that sort of benefit from digital health devices was easing off, but it sounds like that's kind of ramped up again, would that be correct? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: No, it hasn't ramped up again. It just hasn't eased off as quickly and you know I think that \u2013 as I said I think that tail is longer than we had thought 90 days ago and probably has a little bit more to run in it and \u2013 but it's not just that one country, right, there's 199 others outside of the U.S. and France that we sell into. And I think the point I'm trying to make is it's \u2013 many of the others starting to power up around digital health not just on reimbursement driven ones like that country like France, but on the \u2013 just the core economic and efficacy value prop that we get from the digital health technology that we have now in the AirSense 10 and on the AirCurve 10 and in some of the ventilation platforms as well. Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Great. Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Craig. Operator : Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Securities. Your line is open. Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes, hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. With \u2013 related to Brightree, the high-single-digits organic growth rate, it's kind of a slowdown from what you guys were reporting in fiscal 2018? Is that kind of a one quarter blip or is the high-single-digit growth rate kind of a go-forward rate? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Matt, and that's a really good question. As you noted, yeah, high-single-digits from Brightree but 25% from Brightree plus HEALTHCAREfirst and the other SaaS platforms. Look, it's the first quarter that we were integrating HEALTHCAREfirst. And so we have a team in home health and hospice at Brightree working on integration of those two platforms and in the core HME platform at Brightree. Our team was just at Medtrade this quarter and they've launched, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, brand new apps and some other value props that I think can help add not only more users, but more value per user opportunities as we go throughout fiscal 2019. So do I think that high-single-digits can go back to low-double-digits on the core Brightree? Absolutely. And there's probably three reasons for that. One, as I talked about in competitive bidding we're seeing that landscape really settle out so that people can focus on efficiency versus sort of some of the other aspects of declining reimbursement over the last seven years. Two, with all the changes over the last seven years in the HME industry, there's just a need for more and more efficiencies. And three, as I mentioned, some of these new solutions we're bringing into play. So, for those three reasons, I'm very confident that we can start to get that double-digit growth out of the core Brightree platform, while also integrating HEALTHCAREfirst and tying our home health and hospice value props together as we grow in the HME industry. Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you for the color. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Mick, you mentioned that the Mobi will go into a full product release this quarter. I don't know if you're able to give us some flavor or detail around what your strategy is there and maybe some feedback from the customer base to see what they want to see from such a product. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Sean, just to clarify, I said next quarter. So, we're going to go to full product launch during our Q3, which is our January to March quarter. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Got it. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: But Rob Douglas is here. Rob, do you want to give a little more clarity on to Mobi and our go-to-market model? Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Sure, Sean. We've been experimenting with our controlled product launch throughout the year. It's been slow and steady progress. The customers using it and we've selected them carefully, really liked the product and it's working well. We're seeing really good field performance from it, and we're very happy with it. Mick and I both have been in the factory in Singapore seeing it being built, and we're very, very proud of the systems that we've got there and we think we've got an extremely high quality product. As we've said many times, our go-to-market strategy really involves supporting our HME provider customers to access patients and to get this treatment on the patients in the most effective way and those are really the things we've been looking at closely in the preps for the full launch. And as Mick said, we're well on hand with preparations for full launch starting in the next quarter, in Q3. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Right. Thanks, Rob. And maybe just a quick one for Brett, just to check looking at the balance sheet that stepped down in tax payable, so the issue on cash flow from ops is now in the rear vision mirror, is that correct? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that paid the payable on the balance sheet, we essentially paid that or a lot of that through this quarter, Sean. You saw that come through the cash flow. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Great. Thanks, Brett, and that's all I have. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Okay. Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Thank you, Mick. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean. Operator : Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. The one thing that we're happened to notice since the last few years, your increase in SG&A as a percentage of total sales the fourth quarter relative to the fourth tends to go up, and this is kind of relatively flat, maybe down a little bit. So, can you walk us through any potential changes this quarter outside of ResMed 3.0? And then as we look forward is 4% growth in dollars currency neutral the right number, or will that change given the recent top-line growth that you've seen of 13%? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Margaret, thanks for the question. Yeah, that allows us to talk about the business excellence and the operating excellence programs that we've been putting into place. And clearly, yeah, as you saw in Q1 with the 4% growth in SG&A year-on-year, we really are focused on making sure we don't just work harder, but we work smarter and we have better global processes. We take some of the amazing sort of tech-driven healthcare and tech-driven solutions that we've given to our customers and apply them internally. And so we're looking at tech-driven solutions in systems and softwares within our company to allow us to throw process and technology at a problem not just say we need to hire 20 more people to solve that problem. And so I think our team has got very sophisticated on this and we had some great results. As you know, we don't give detailed quarter-to-quarter guidance on exactly what we're going to do in terms of year-on-year growth. But we're going to keep that SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the bounds that Brett said in his prepared remarks. And I'd love to do better than that, but that's the sort of guidance that we're going to give and stick to. What we saw in this quarter was excellent performance from our team. We've got 6,000 people selling in 120 countries and selling a lot more and selling a lot smarter, and I love the results and we want to do more of the above. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just as a quick follow-up to one your other comments, Mick, you had mentioned M&A within the SaaS ex-U.S. and Europe and Asia is kind of geographic targets perhaps. So maybe you can describe kind of what attributes you guys are looking for and should we assume that those targets are going to be focused on your largest geographies or maybe smaller that are good fits that you can expand into other geographies? Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Margaret, that's a good follow-up. It allows us to talk about the M&A strategy in that global SaaS business. So you know as you heard, Margaret, and many others on our Investor Day where we had a drill-down from Raj Sodhi, who's the global President of our SaaS business. He's the global President of our SaaS business and a lot of the focus has been on Brightree, which is U.S. focused and HEALTHCAREfirst, which is U.S. focused. We do sell in 120 other countries and we're clearly looking for opportunities outside there. I'm not going to signal because it's a competitive market exactly what geographies and what sectors we're looking at outside. I do just want to let our investor base know that we are looking at that opportunity. And we are also looking within the United States. Look, as you saw in the quarter incredible organic growth, right. I mean, 25% across just Brightree and HEALTHCAREfirst and all the tuck-ins we've put in there, we think that opportunity is there within the U.S.; and for ResMed, we think we have the right to be the world's leading provider of out-of-hospital medical software. We've done it in HME. We're doing it really well in home health and hospice verticals, and there are other verticals in the out-of-hospital care sector that we think can help within the U.S. geography and beyond. So, Margaret, without getting really specific, that's what I was talking to, and as we look at M&A, it's got to meet three criteria : Number one, it's got to fit our global strategy; two, it's got to make sense on the numbers and fit our financial strategy; and three, it's got to be a strong cultural fit. It has to be a fit between us and the management team and that we're going to work together and work better together and provide some growth to each other and sharing across the platform. So that's how we look at M&A. Thanks for the questions, Margaret. Operator : Your next question comes from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Lyanne, if you're speaking, you're on mute. Okay, Chris. Let's go to the next question. Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello. (00:38:52) Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Oh, no, here's Lyanne. Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, here we go. Sorry about that. I'm just \u2013 I have a question around your operating leverage and with your gross margins for this quarter. Can you shed some light in terms of what sort of operating leverage mechanisms were in place to help counter your ASP reductions? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. I'll hand that \u2013 it's a good question, Lyanne. I'll hand that question to Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. Yeah, Lyanne. We've got, I mean it's probably where \u2013 we've got quite a large program in place, I guess, which is kind of cost out programs or initiatives around efficiencies and improvements in processes, improvements in procurement or logistics, which basically we look at, I mean, we look at it well over time, but on a monthly basis and pretty formalized in terms of making sure we have a good pipeline of opportunities that we've always got. And then, looking and seeing and make sure that we're executing on those pipeline of opportunities as well. So quite sophisticated in what we do to make sure that we can operate it efficiently as we can. And clearly, if we can do that, that supports the gross margin and offsets as you can see this quarter, essentially offsets some typical ASP decline. So, that can be around a lot, I mean it can be around improvements to production, routing and selling that would improve, for example, recoveries that we make on the back of growing volumes or it could be around procurement and working even more closely nowadays with suppliers to make sure we can get the products not just as cheaply as we can but kind of as smart as we can in terms of the components and kind of what they can offer us and we try to build that into our prices as well. The kind of, I guess, quite \u2013 it gets more sophisticated in terms of how you're partnering and that's tended to help us in driving out some cost as well and there's no silver bullet. It's a number of programs and a number of opportunities that we have to work on essentially day in and day out. But, I guess, it's almost part of our DNA to make sure we could deliver on those and that's \u2013 and we don't hold back. There's not an endpoint, it's just an ongoing process. And so that's basically what the team works on particularly on the operations side. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Brett, also just to add in there Lyanne, we're running really an innovation-driven growth company and we're investing to grow the company, but we've got a really solid base of a lot of existing patients and existing business. So, a lot of our sort of leverage strategies around improving efficiencies in those core parts of the business, enabling the investments in innovation to really start driving new and more efficient ways to go to market, and then that feeds on itself going that way. But we're really getting leverage by investing appropriately in the growth areas and getting more efficient in the existing areas. Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just to follow-up on that, you mentioned there was an improvement in logistics costs as well. Have you seen your logistic costs increase with the rising fuel cost? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Well I mean I think that might start to manifest, but it's not \u2013 I don't \u2013 it will be a cost impact for us but I don't think it would be significant for us. I mean, it's certainly there. I don't want to discount it completely but it's not \u2013 it wouldn't be like a huge component of costs for us. Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee : Thanks very much for taking my question. Just on U.S. masks, the 11% was a good number on \u2013 a very good number actually on tough comps. Just trying to get a sense whether you're seeing the acceleration of your resupply growth in that number? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good question Andrew. I mean certainly, we have seen some good success of the QuietAir technology that has been in there now two and a half quarters and then the brand new launch of the F30 out the gate may have had some impact, but Jim Hollingshead who is the President of our Global Sleep Business might have some commentary as to the resupply. James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Andrew. There are a couple of things going on in the North America market. The first one is, the mask portfolio, our product mix is performing very well. So the F20 is performing very well, the N20 is performing very well and so our position with new patients is very strong. But resupply is also doing well and what we've seen over the last several quarters is an increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms by HMEs in the market. And so I think we're getting growth on both sides of it, both new patient and resupply. Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee : That's terrific. And just picking up on that question on ASP, I'm guessing that with your GM being flat it's primarily driven by devices up 14%, masks up 10%. Just trying to think, going forward, whether that maybe brings about any change in your GMs for your devices? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, look certainly the portable oxygen concentrator market is closer to the gross margin profile of the CPAP range versus that you'd find in a full face mask or a Software as a Service solution and so yeah, we think it's fantastic gross profit dollar contribution that we can achieve from the portable oxygen concentrator market that it will be in a lower gross margin percentage dollar. We still think it's a great market to go after because of the 400 million patients worldwide, who suffer from lung disease, how they want to get out of their home and be untethered from that liquid oxygen, POCs provide a great opportunity and ResMed with our experience in digital health and what we can do when we not only give great quality oxygen and portability and reliability in the Mobi, but then also in the future bring our digital health capabilities to bear, we think it's a great market to go after. So, yeah, you'll see both of those, growth in gross profit dollars, some impact on the gross margin percentage, but certainly ResMed investing in a strong strategic area, in a chronic disease that needs our help and we can help keep these patients out of hospital and happily in their home or in the park playing with their grandkids with lung disease and our ResMed Mobi. Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee : Great. So, it's a more absolute growth as opposed to sort of margin leverage through that I guess, through that change in mix. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks (00:45:49). Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee : Yeah. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Correct. Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee : Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for your questions, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. Mick, just picking up on your comment about resupply in markets outside the U.S., so just wondering if you could give us some \u2013 any metrics at all in terms of where the bigger European markets are at versus the U.S. so we could perhaps get some sense of the opportunity there? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, David. Look and I know you've followed our stock for many years and so, it's not new news to you that the resupply rate is stronger in the U.S. than in Western Europe and Asia. One thing we're finding as we now are expanding our digital health capability and empowering patients worldwide, now 6 million to 8million patients worldwide with their digital health data is that when patients get control of their data and get control of their healthcare, they demand more things. And one of the things they demand is a clean mask. And I personally use a device and if you're not changing your mask every three months or worse six months, the thing gets incredibly visually in need of replacement. And I think if you look at the average replacement in the U.S. it's around two masks per year on average in some data that was public on that front. We think it could be more than that. If you empower patients with the ability to access different models to get resupply. We're working on that in Brightree and in ResMed Resupply and Brightree Connect. But we also think for the other 120 countries we do business in, there's an opportunity to empower patients with their data, empower patients with an opportunity to have access to more masks on an annual basis. And I'm looking at Jim Hollingshead here, our President of our Global Sleep Business. I mean, Jim you know resupply outside the U.S. is something we've been looking at for a long period of time. Digital health gives us an opportunity, right? James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Digital health certainly drives it and I think patients definitely want clean masks and resupply mask. And by the way, I'll throw \u2013 I'll add to that point that recent research shows that when a patient is resupplied, they're more adherent, right. And so, we're seeing more and more evidence for that and I think that that's starting to influence more and more physicians worldwide. But if you think about Europe and resupply, you've got this massive variety of payment models. I mean, we wouldn't have time to go through them all on the call. But what you are seeing is pretty steady resupply in most of those markets. And in some cases patients are getting resupplied because the hospital system has trouble doing it, just has trouble executing on it. And so, you'll \u2013 in certain countries, more and more we're providing that kind of service on behalf of the hospital system. I mean, that's a very different model from the U.S. where you've got a fee-for-service resupply that's driving demand. In certain countries in Europe, a hospital system wants to give the patient a mask just administratively can't do it. And so, that's one of the ways we're driving resupply in different European markets. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: But, so it would seem that it would be fair to say that the resupply rates across, let's pick the three or four biggest European markets, are significantly lower than the U.S. perhaps only half? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: They are low. We haven't gone into sort of the quantitative on that. And I don't think there's been any like external research public that I can talk to on that David. But clearly outside the U.S. the resupply rates are lower. The bottom line is patient demand is there. And as Jim said, even sometimes the channel partner and the patient want to deliver, they just don't know how and haven't got the capability to do it. ResMed has the capability to do it and we've proven that in a number of international markets outside the U.S. And what I was talking to on the answer earlier was that we plan to rev up those capabilities and really help our customers, the patients, and the providers provide better care. And as Jim said, that leads to better adherence and lower cost for the healthcare system. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Great. Thanks for that. Could I just squeeze one other in? Brett, we've worried a little bit about legal costs and that having an impact on the operating leverage. I was wondering if you could just talk to what we \u2013 what came through in the quarter past and what we should expect for the year ahead. Thanks. Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, David, it's been, I guess, our legal cases and so on have been ongoing for a while now. So it's more or less built into the run rate. And, I mean, it can vary around a little bit quarter-to-quarter but I wouldn't expect it \u2013 it's sort of built into the run rate, so I wouldn't expect that to significantly spike through the year or anything like that. Leading up to court cases and so on, it can increase a little. But I don't think it would be particularly meaningful in any quarter at least that's what our expectation is at this stage. It's more or less built into the run rate that we've seen over the last year or two. David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Yeah. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open. David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just in terms of the business acquisition you made in the quarter of $126 million, firstly, I missed the name of it and second, did that lead to any profit contribution for the quarter please? And if so, can you give us some color around that? Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, David. The acquisition was HEALTHCAREfirst. So, it's a Software as a Service provider for home health, so home nursing and hospice providers within the U.S. geography, a really exciting business that did contribute in the quarter as we talked about to driving the 25% year-on-year growth in our Software as a Service global business. Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to the other parts of David's question as to impact on profitability during the quarter or not going into too much further detail there? Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I can. It's a nice acquisition, but it's not a large one as such. So, it's not \u2013 we wouldn't get that granular on that Dave, but we did, I think last call or the call before I think we sort of said that the revenue from that was about $28 million or $29 million something like that. So, that will kind of size it for you. Obviously some profit contributions, but on the size of our business, I guess, kind of quarterly fairly de minimis. But from a portfolio standpoint, our SaaS business, quite exciting space and we're seeing good growth opportunities there. So, we do think that's strong, strategically, just a small contribution initially, but we do think that should give us a nice growth trajectory. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Just to add on to that David, the home health and hospice category or vertical if you like that HEALTHCAREfirst sells into, Brightree also sells into that. So, we've got those two teams integrating and working together to drive, as Brett said, good ongoing organic growth as we look forward in the coming quarters and fiscal years within that home health and hospice vertical which we think is underserved, for this great software and there's a lot of opportunity to grow. David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin with UBS. Your line is open. Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Good morning, good afternoon, Mick. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just looking at the 14% devices growth, strong growth globally, can you give any color or talk to how the non-invasive ventilation part of your business is going relative to the core sleep, CPAP part of the business? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So as you know we don't break out the particular AirCurve 10 versus the AirSense 10 aspect of that and we don't break out the Astral and we just launched the Mobi. But the vast majority of the sales are in the sleep side of the business as you know that's what the company was founded on, it's our core business. I'm really excited by the new software upgrade to Astral and it's really starting to come out of the gate well. But it's not a strong \u2013 wasn't a strong material contributor in the quarter. We do think, as we look forward, that the AirCurve 10 and Astral life support ventilator and the Mobi, those three together in our respiratory care vertical will really start to contribute. And I look forward to the earnings call when I'm breaking them out and going through them in detail because it's material to the global business. But at this point, we don't break them out to that level of detail but I appreciate your question. And yeah, certainly that 14% global number it really \u2013 as I said in the prepared remarks, it really talks to the economic value proposition of the digital health. People are choosing our devices and we're taking share even three plus four years out on some of these platforms because the software isn't four years out, it was updated two weeks ago, four weeks ago and it'll be upgraded every month this coming 12 months. So, that's sort of the picture there, Saul, but appreciate your question. Sorry, I can't go into more granular detail for you. Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Not after breakout of revenues by device type, but just more interested in whether the growth in the contribution of whatever revenue it was for the non-invasive platform within the space is on par with what you see in sort of the core sleep therapies, is it materially lower, higher just that type of comment. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, no. It's on par and in the future has the potential to be well ahead of given the under-met opportunity particularly in portable oxygen concentrators that are digitally powered and I think in the NIV space. I mean you look at the clinical data that we presented over the last number of quarters showing that we can reduce hospitalizations, reduce costs and really improve the lives of these COPD patients. I think NIV is particularly in the U.S. and non-sort of Western European geographies completely underpenetrated versus its opportunity in the COPD space. So, I think there is an opportunity for it to be materially above, but in Q1, it was pretty much in line with the growth across the other businesses. Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thank you. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks Saul. Operator : Your next question comes from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks very much. So just in rest of world you've had reimbursement changes in France, Japan, South Korea over the last 12 months. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on where you are in terms of discussions for the other reimbursements \u2013 like potential reimbursement changes in other rest of world markets, do you anticipate any changes in the next 6 to 12 months? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Gretel. It's a great question. And yeah, certainly we saw the digital health changes for doctors in Japan, we saw the digital health changes for home care providers in France and we saw for the first time in the history of the country actual reimbursement for CPAP as a treatment for sleep apnea in South Korea that we talked about last quarter. So, those are all three really good wins. Our global market access team is incredibly focused on this as we look at the 120 countries we do business in and how to help governments understand that CPAP therapy saves money and improves lives and improves outcomes and quality of lives. And so, we are in all countries \u2013 I think if you just take the example of the French reimbursement changes, our French team have been talking for three to five years with the French Ministry for Health (sic) [Ministry for Solidarity and Health] (00:57:41) to show the return on investment of the digital health initiatives. And so, when that reimbursement change came, it wasn't a surprise to us. It was a lot of hard work to get it to that point and change. But predicting when governments will put good policy behind great opportunities to save money and improve the lives of their constituents is a bet that I'm not willing to put out there or predict which country will be next. But I promise, Gretel, that as soon as we see the changes come that we'll report them here on our quarterly call and let you know how it works. Jim, that team works really closely with your global sleep team, any further color on that? James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: We talked a little bit about this at Investors Day. I think that the global market access team continues to work on multiple fronts to get payors and government entities to see the positive return on finding and treating the sleep apnea patient. But as Mick said earlier, the digital health platform creates value for care providers with or without reimbursement, right. So, we're seeing the growth of the business and the growth of treatment of patients with the digital care platforms of Air Solutions and the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 devices because it creates value for the care provider. We're continuing to chase reimbursement wherever we can because we think we have a very strong story to tell about health economics, but the digital care platforms create a lot of value in their own right. Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks for your time. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for your questions, Gretel. Operator : Our last question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Your line is open. David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the Mobi, just wondering if there's anything you can point to in relation to differentiation relative to other products in the market. Can't \u2013 I haven't really been able to see much by way of product specifications. But just wondering if there's anything you can talk to in relation to either weight, battery life, et cetera that would set you apart from the other offerings in the POC space? Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that's a great question David and a really exciting space. Rob, do you want to go into some of the details of how we're going to show value in those specs, but also the go-to-market? Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Yes, David we haven't really made a lot of publicity to you all around the specs of Mobi, because I actually don't think that's sort of the right way of looking at it. The issue here on these POC devices is really getting the right balance of features that make it the most usable product. So, we've got a really good battery life. We've got a great weight and a really good oxygen output that lets people be mobile and to use a device with confidence. If you just pick one parameter and say it's stronger in this and stronger in that, it's actually not really getting the point of how we think competition should be operating in this market. So, we've got a great product configuration with a really good optimal trade-off. We think it's the optimal trade-off of the specs. And as we said before, we're really pursuing go-to-market strategy with the support and a way for us to support our HME partners really in countries around the world. And so, I know it's still a watch this space program, but we're really taking a disciplined approach to launching the product. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, David the only thing I'd add on there is I think partnering with your channel particularly one \u2013 we had two decades, three decades of working with our channel in the sleep space to partner with them in the respiratory care space we think is the right strategy. We don't think some of our competitors are competing with the channel in this space and I just don't think it's a smart strategy. I think you want to partner with a channel and really drive value to that end user patient. The ultimate customer here is the patient. We have to find the best way to get them and our channel has such great ability to reach sleep apnea patients and COPD patients in the past. They've often been the ones to provide liquid oxygen. They should be the ones to provide portable oxygen. And so I think the go-to-market strategy will differentiate us more than others. But David, watch this space, we'll talk to you in 90, in 180, in 360 days about how the Mobi rollout goes and I think we'll start to see that really pick up. David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: That's great. Thanks. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for your questions, David. Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: And so we've now reached the hour mark. And look, before we close the call, I want to thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team for their continued dedication, focus and commitment to our growth strategy and our operating excellence initiatives. Our team is the core of what we do and it's helped us deliver another quarter of really strong revenue growth and increased operating leverage. We remain focused on our future pipeline of products, services, and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, the patients, physicians, payors, home care providers and governments. Thanks for your time and we look forward to talking to you again in 90 days. Over to you, Amy. Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thank you. Thank you again for joining us today. If you do have additional questions, please feel free to contact me directly. As mentioned at the beginning of the call, the webcast replay along with our earnings release and updated Investor Presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Chris, you may now go ahead and close the call. Operator : This concludes ResMed's first quarter of fiscal year 2019 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks Chris. Good afternoon and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. The call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Joining me on the call today to discuss our results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call after our prepared remarks. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Michael Farrell : Thanks Amy and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights, our ResMed 2025 strategy, and a few key milestones from the quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. First, the top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth, up 9% constant currency or up 10% on a non-GAAP basis globally. Even as we observed the expected impact on European and Asian device sales as our customers completed the cloud connected device upgrade programs in France and Japan. We delivered strong operating leverage and we achieved non-GAAP operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year. We continue to maintain fiscal discipline and invest to grow the business for the long-term. Let me provide a few highlights across our global sleep apnea and global respiratory care businesses. It has been nearly four and a half years since we launched the AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software platform. As we've discussed before, we are upgrading the capability of our software systems, including myAir and AirView with new features every two to four weeks. Based on this customer value, we continue to grow our device market share in the quarter as healthcare providers and physicians and patients are choosing ResMed due to the fact that these digital health solutions improved both business and patient outcomes. We are leading the industry with digital health technology, supporting well over 9 million patients within AirView, our cloud-based patient management system, and more than 8 million 100% cloud connectable devices now in the market. Over the past 12 months, we have improved the lives of well over 40 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD treatment products. We are pioneering the path forward as we utilize digital health technology to turn big data into actionable insights for patients, for physicians, for homecare providers, for payers, and beyond. We now have over 3.5 billion nights of sleep apnea and COPD treatment data in the cloud and that growth continues to be exponential. Using advanced analytics, we are focusing on developing solutions to get optimal healthcare to the right patient when it is needed. Everything we do supports our ambition to help the more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and then nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic lung disease. As we expand our digital health platforms, one of our goals has been to take the success we have had with myAir and AirView within our sleep apnea vertical and replicate that within our respiratory care business. We have made good progress with cloud connectable AirCurve devices for non-invasive ventilation and Astral devices with cloud connectable options for life support ventilation. We needed to add digital health solutions for inhaled pharmaceutical for COPD that are utilized in the earlier stages of COPD disease progression in the medical devices and that also constitute more of the treatment cost than the medical devices. To this exact point, during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Propeller Health and the deal was closed just a few weeks ago. Propeller's digital health solutions helps people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma. Propeller has a sophisticated digital health platform that leverages small sensors that are attached to the pharmaceutical inhalers along with the cloud-based software system and cloud-based mobile app that automatically tracks medication use and provides personalized feedback as well as insights to the individual. Propeller has critically validated solutions that have demonstrated a 58% improvement in medication adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free days, and a 53% reduction in emergency room visits to the hospital. These are astounding data and we cannot wait to scale these relations with our new pharmaceutical partners. Propeller's ability to support people in Stage II and Stage III COPD are very complementary to our existing suite of cloud connectable ventilators for those patients with Stage III and Stage IV COPD. The combination is powerful. We are now even better positioned to become the global leader in digital health for COPD and help people as they manage this important progressive and expensive chronic disease. Propeller has been an incredibly successful company to-date and we continue to operate as a standalone entity. We have retained the extremely dedicated management team and we expect their momentum with pharmaceutical company customers to continue. ResMed brings long-term financial stability and has proven itself as a company that can operate digital health systems at scale and across a global portfolio of countries. Propeller and ResMed, we are going to be powerful partners together. This partnership completes an important piece of the puzzle for the ResMed 2025 strategy, providing a clear roadmap for global leadership in digital health for COPD. Switching back now to talk about our core operations. On the devices side of our business, we achieved 7% growth in The United States, Canada, and Latin America. Including the impact of the completion of digital health upgrade systems in France and Japan, our global growth in devices was 3% on a constant currency basis. While we have been thrilled with the digital health reimbursement changes in France and Japan during 2018 and they will have great long-term benefits of increased adherence in mask sales in those geographies, we expect that the impact in France and Japan will be present for the next few quarters. We will then return to market growth in devices within France and Japan and above market growth within those geographies after that. Outside of these two countries, our device growth was strong during the quarter and we expect that to continue as we move forward. Last quarter, we discussed that Mobi, our new portable oxygen concentrator would move to a full product launch sometime in our third quarter and we made that official launch just earlier this month. We are working in full partnership with our home medical equipment customers to help grow this category and we are excited to bring the product to market that optimizes the balances of key features such as size, weight, and oxygen output. We believe that this product best meets the needs of oxygen users who want to be more mobile and enjoy healthy active lives outside their homes. Customers will vote with their wallets and we expect that not only this POC category will grow, but also ResMed will grow its share within the POC category. Although it will take a quite a while for this business category to be material next to our core sleep apnea in ventilation device businesses. The masks and accessory side of our business grew at 10% in constant currency on a global basis during the quarter. The U.S. Canada and Latin America geographies grew at 11% in masks and accessories. We are continuing to see great traction with two of our flagship products in this category, the AirFit F20 in the full-face category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category. We are seeing strong growth across all geographies for these two masks. Last quarter, we also launched the AirFit F30, an exciting innovation and what we are calling the minimal contact full-face mask category. Initial customer feedback on the F30 is incredibly positive and we have a lot of runway ahead for this product. Earlier just this week, we announced the broad availability of our newest mask, the AirFit N30i. This is an important addition to our portfolio in what we are calling that tube-up design nasal mask category. With the N30i, we have further expanded our mask portfolio to offer even more options to homecare providers and ultimately for the varying needs of individual therapy uses. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved and unmet customer needs. The F20 and F30 as well as the N20 and N30i form a powerful portfolio to address these customer needs. Let's turn now to a discussion of our Software-as-a-Service business. We announced and closed the $750 million acquisition of MatrixCare during the quarter. MatrixCare is an incredibly fast growing and profitable business that brings ResMed into a number of new verticals within the out-of-hospital healthcare software space, including skilled nursing facilities, senior living facilities, life plan communities, and beyond. We also completed a technology tuck-in acquisition called Apacheta, which will help drive increased growth in our core Brightree software business. The Software-as-a-Service portfolio continues its trajectory of excellent growth with revenue up 63% year-on-year, driven by continued expansion of Brightree and the full quarter contribution from HEALTHCAREfirst along with partial quarter contributions from MatrixCare and Apacheta. We have a vision to transform out-of-hospital healthcare and these acquisitions have established ResMed as a strategic player in the best position to do so. We have a proven track record of transforming our market through SaaS-based software and solutions and we have demonstrated success and experience with Brightree these last three years. We now offer software solutions across an even broader portfolio of out-of-hospital healthcare settings from home medical equipment to home health to hospice to skilled nursing facilities to senior living to private duty and beyond. We are helping our customers in each of these care settings to be the most efficient that they can be to ultimately better serve people and keep them out of hospital and in a low cost, higher quality care setting, often in their own home. Together with our customers and partners, we are revolutionizing how our healthcare is delivered and received, leveraging an ecosystem of integrated digital solutions and services. The ultimate goal is to help the person seamlessly move between care settings that they can have optimal care and optimal quality of life wherever they're living. In parallel to help individuals, we will drive superior outcomes for their physicians, payers, and their providers. We have built a portfolio, now it's up to our team to integrate our technology and business workflows, and ultimately, to execute and deliver on this promise. Now, I'd like to spend a little time talking about our global business excellence programs. We have a dedicated team of over 6,500 ResMedians that delivered another quarter of double-digit net operating profit. This is now the sixth quarter in a row of driving operating leverage. A key benefit of this operating leverage is that it provides us the flexibility to invest money back into our innovation teams so that they can help us drive sustainable long-term revenue growth. Non-GAAP income from operations improved 15% in the quarter combining revenue growth and expanded gross margin with disciplined investments in SG&A as well as in R&D. We are taking a controlled and thoughtful approach to manage the business for the long-term. We continue to invest in our business to deliver strong organic growth. Before I turn the call over to Brett, I'd like to discuss briefly the ResMed 2025 strategy. As we look at the macroeconomic environment in healthcare, the burden of chronic disease is increasing. We have an aging population; nearly 9% of the world's population is age 65 or older. And by 2050, that number will almost double to 17%. So, that will be 1.6 billion people over age 65 around the world. We all know healthcare costs are growing and there aren't enough doctors to treat the people who need to be treated today. Couple of these data with issues such as the pain points of getting the right care to the right patient at the right time, delivering care in lower cost settings, and challenges with interoperability, documentation, and data availability. It's a global health care crisis. But on the microeconomic side and within our sphere of influence, which is in digital health for sleep apnea, digital health for COPD, and out-of-hospital healthcare software, we believe these are problems that ResMed can help solve. At the highest level, the mission of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to impact and improve 250 million lives in out-of-hospital healthcare. Our purpose is to empower people to live healthier, happier, and high-quality lives in the comfort of their own home. Our advantage comes from our focus on tech-driven integrated care from sleep apnea and COPD awareness, to diagnosis, to treatment and then ongoing therapy and healthcare management with digital health solutions. Our joint venture with Verily is an example of partnering to drive identification, engagement, and enrollment of sleep apnea patients early in their journey. We will help more and more of the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate with sleep apnea each night to find a better pathway to therapy, leveraging partners, and partnerships such as this. Let me close with this. We have delivered another solid quarter and we are well-positioned for continued success throughout 2019 and beyond. The continued traction of our diversified and growing mask and device portfolio along with an expanded and expanding pipeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions to sleep apnea, COPD, and the out-of-hospital medical software markets give us confidence in ongoing momentum for our business. We're applying ResMed's growth and innovation in the key chronic diseases of sleep apnea and COPD, as well as innovation in software for out-of-hospital healthcare. We have positioned the company for the long-term, driving top and bottom-line growth into 2025 and beyond. By enabling better care, we are improving quality of life, reducing the impact of chronic disease, and lowering the costs for consumers and healthcare systems around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll open up the line for Q&A session. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was $651.1 million, an increase of 8% over the prior quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $358.5 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets totaled $229.4 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 1% over the prior quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments; U.S., Canada, and Latin America device sales were $186.5 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $172 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales were $156.2 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 2% decrease. Masks and other sales were $73.2 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 3%, while masks and other sales increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service segment revenue for the second quarter was $63.3 million, an increase of 63% over the prior quarter. This includes revenue from our Brightree, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare businesses. Note that MatrixCare acquisition closed on November 13, 2018. So, we had recognized MatrixCare revenue and expenses in Q2 FY 2019 from this date. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, a purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare preferred revenue, and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reforms. In the prior year comparable, this excludes amortization acquired intangibles and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reform. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for December quarter was 68.9%. Excluding the MatrixCare purchase accounting deferred revenue fair value adjustment, our gross margin for the December quarter was 59.1% compared with 58.2% in the prior year quarter and 58.3% in Q1 FY 2019. Compared to the prior year, our adjusted gross margin increased by 90 basis points, predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product mix, and the MatrixCare acquisition, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Excluding the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the MatrixCare acquisition was accretive to our gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for second half of fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q2 FY 2019 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $161.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 8%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.8% compared to the 25.2% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 25% for the second half of fiscal year 2019. R&D expenses for the quarter were $43.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses decreased by 1%, reflecting lower clinical trial expenses in the current quarter relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared with 6.8% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, subject to currency movement and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the second half of fiscal year 2019. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $16.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $181.1 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $144.5 million consistent with prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1 consistent with the prior year quarter; while GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.86. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted second quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the weaker Australian dollar, which were, however, substantially offset by the weaker euro. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.5%, while on a non-GAAP basis; our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%. Both our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates benefited from our higher than usual tax benefit of $13.1 million associated with employee share-based payments transactions during the quarter. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 22.4%. We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 22% to 24%. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $129.5 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $36 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $52.8 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. Given our recent acquisition, we have suspended our share buyback program. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares in the December quarter. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of MatrixCare for consideration of $750 million. The acquisition is accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share with an initial quarterly incremental benefit of approximately $0.01 per share to the second half of FY 2019. Additionally, on January 7, 2019, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health in consideration of $225 million. We now expect Propeller Health to have a diluted impact on our quarterly non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter for the second half of FY 2019. Associated with these acquisitions, we also incurred acquisition-related expenses of $6.1 million in the December quarter. Our joint venture with Verily commenced operations during the quarter and we contributed an initial $25 million in cash to the joint venture entity. We recorded equity losses of $3.4 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity losses each quarter in the second half of FY 2019 associated with the joint venture operations. Given the recent acquisition activity, I would like to update you on our expected increase in net interest expense. For the second half of FY 2019, we expect to record net interest expense of approximately $14 million per quarter, reflecting our increased debt position as a result of our recent acquisitions. At December 31, we have $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1.05 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31, total assets were $3.9 billion and net equity was $2 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue. Chris, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open. David Stanton : Thank you very much and thanks for taking my question. I guess just wanted to talk a little bit more about the acquisition of Propeller Health and just run through the synergies between Propeller and the base business. I know you talked to that to some extent, I wonder if you could then outline and give a little bit more color, please. Thank you. Michael Farrell : Yes, David, it's a really good question. So, as I said in the prep remarks, Propeller is really that missing puzzle piece. When you think about digital health for COPD, for lung disease, medical devices in total constitute about 15% of the total cost and 85% of the costs is in the pharmaceutical side. Now, clearly, we're not getting into the manufacturing or distribution of pharmaceuticals, but what Propeller does allow ResMed to do is to participate in the digital health that every time someone clicks and takes a puff on their inhaler, a sensor sends data to the cloud that either chronic or acute medicine has been taken for that COPD patient. So, this gets us to a digital health portfolio that covers all the way from Stage II lung disease through to Stage IV lung disease. And as we build and we've talked about building a digital health portfolio to -- the true aim here is to improve quality of life, keep patient in the home, especially out of the hospital, you need to be across that whole portfolio. So, we're just really excited. Propeller Health has relationships with GSK, with Boehringer Ingelheim, and they are working on all the major COPD pharmaceutical companies and forming partnerships with them. And ResMed brings to the party a number of things. We've have operated digital health at scale across our sleep business and we're going to do that here in respiratory care. We operate in 120 countries worldwide and have digital health in many, many countries worldwide, and we're going to help Propeller with that. And we're really supportive of the management team. They are very linked to ResMed's culture, which is focused on patient, keeping them out of hospital and improving care. So, as we look forward to Propeller over the coming a year, two or three, you're going to start to see ResMed create digital health solutions for COPD that are going to change and bend the cost curve of hospitals and healthcare systems, and particularly, for the patients themselves. And -- so we're really excited to have this part of the team. David Stanton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners. Your line is open. Steve Wheen : Yes, good morning. This is for Brett. Just wanted to talk about the gross margin and trying to break down a bit. Obviously, lots of moving parts here. You gave us the MatrixCare contribution, are we able to try and take out the different components? In particular, I wanted to look at FX in the quarter? And what that might look like going forward given the quite of big ships more recently? And then previously you have mentioned what sort of manufacturing efficiencies contributing to the gross margin, so any color there would be great. Brett Sandercock : Sure Steve. I mean FX for the quarter year-on-year was not -- was pretty small, it's probably in the range of 20 basis points. I'm going to call that MatrixCare and the other kind of contributed equally meaningful will be manufacturing efficiencies and also favorable product mix. So, we're starting to see that come through particularly with our performance in masks. So, that's certainly helping. On the manufacturing pharm efficiencies, procurement, and so on, I think things are improving kind of cycle-times and production efficiencies over time, but I think we're also benefiting now from pretty good volumes coming through and pretty good recoveries on the production side of things, incremental volumes kind of hitting up to Singapore as well and we're getting some scale benefits there. The combination of those factors I think are leading to some good manufacturing efficiencies that have been flowing through over the last few quarters. Steve Wheen : Okay. And FX then going into future periods, is that likely to be a driver as well? Brett Sandercock : So, currently where we are in terms of euro, if I look forward and just look at it sequentially, I think we still get a small benefit; it's probably only going to 10 to 20 basis point mark unless you saw obviously waiting from wherever at. The currency wherever they are now, I would estimate probably sort of 10 to 20 basis points tailwind for us sequentially. Steve Wheen : Okay, got it. And just finally on the -- just wanted some clarification on equity accounted losses. Could you just repeat the future quarter impact, didn't quite catch that? And then where is that coming from? What particular acquisition is driving those debt equity? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Sure. That's our Verily joint venture. So, we need to take out in terms of debt accounting losses associated with debt equity. For this quarter, it was $3.4 million and I estimate for the next few quarters, I would say, Q3 and Q4, that will be around $7 million per quarter. Steve Wheen : Okay. And does that turnaround or what's driving that loss? Brett Sandercock : The JV at the moment is thing about more of a kind of a startup phase if you like. So, it will be kind of expenses that are coming through initially. Obviously, that JV was quite pretty high, I guess, in terms of what it can do; particularly being able to, let's call it, the $936 million patients out there. I think about it is as being able to identify with those, information is engaged with those patients, many of those patients on therapy. So, kind of think about it like that as pretty big opportunities there, but at this stage, the JV is exploring those and obviously, they will pay some money to do that initially. Yes, ultimately, we expect that to turnaround for sure. Operator : Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon folks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the growth outside of the Americas and specifically, maybe outside of France and Japan. So, if you guys can provide any kind of color underlying demand, any potential competitive changes, any catalysts that maybe we should look out for? And then as you kind of look at that growth outlook going forward, what could drive it above or below the results that you guys reported this past quarter in total? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Thanks Margaret, that's a good question. So, looking at our rest of the world market growth, I just want to make this point right up front. The patient growth in terms of the growth in both France and Japan and all the other countries we do business in, has been very good during this quarter and we expect be continued in strong growth as we look forward throughout FY 2019 and beyond. So, patient growth is really strong. We did have well above market growth in the last number of quarters as we had the digital health and connected health upgrades in France and Japan. And as we said last quarter and the quarter before on this call and in Q&A, we expect that that impact to change and then that's present in those numbers. So we're saying for the next few quarters, France and Japan will be slow for a couple of quarters and then we'll get back to market growth and then ahead of market growth through the fact that we now have an installed base of digital health devices out there that should drive greater adherence and therefore greater use of masks and accessories within France and Japan and beyond. So, in terms of the other -- during the quarter the growth in other markets outside France and Japan and U.S. and Canada, we saw excellent growth. We are not going to go through individually exactly what we saw in different countries in Western Europe and Asia-Pacific, but we saw really good underlying growth on the device and on the masks side. So, look we are very excited about our global growth in devices as we look forward not just rather fiscal year, but into next fiscal year. Margaret Kaczor : And any specific commentary as it relates to the growth profiles in the next year, two years, where excluding the tax that can help accelerate the growth or whatever have it go down? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Yes, we don't see it's going down. I mean look, we know the global growth in this market is in the mid to high-single digits. ResMed has never really excited that. As you saw over the last fiscal year or two, rest of the world market, we're driving digital market; country-by-country we've seen some great growth within those countries. So, what happened in France and Japan, we hope to happen to the other 120 countries we are working and where we get a chance to upgrade platforms towards a digital health side because it's a real step change for the industry. But no that mid to high single-digit global growth we expect to continue for the future and for ResMed to not just accept that, but to drive ahead of it. Brett was just explaining the investments in Verily. Well, that's about finding ways to identifying guidance people to bend that growth curve to a higher and higher grade, and we've got multiple investments, Sleep School Labs, Verily, and a number of other partnerships with payers, providers, even governments to drive that forward. So, Margaret in the global growth is in that mid to high-single-digits, but our goal just within sleep is to drive ahead of that. As we add on digital health and COPD and then you add on the Software-as-service-Side, can ResMed drive well above that market growth, absolutely, we have proven that over the last five years and we'll plan to do that as we go towards our 2025 strategy that I outlined in the prep remarks. Operator : Your next question is from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Lyanne Harrison : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to understand a little bit about just Software-as-a-Service business and I know you mentioned there was something like 60% growth overall business. Can you sort of shed some color on the underlying Brightree growth? And what are your expectations going forward into subsequent quarters? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks. That's a good question. Yes, clearly, the 63% growth for the quarter included organic and inorganic growth in those businesses. And we are now moving towards the point where Software-as-a-Service has become big enough to become a segment that we're going to talk about going forward. So, I'm happy to talk about it in a little more detail. So, yes, 63% growth for the quarter, including Brightree along with HEALTHCAREfirst, MatrixCare, and Apacheta. So, very solid growth. Within each of those businesses, they had different organic growth profiles. Without going into very, very low levels of detail, the Brightree core business grew in that sort of mid to high single-digits area and obviously with the Brightree management team. We had a Board meeting earlier, this week and we are looking throughout the next four, six, eight quarters and they have a very strong path way back to double-digit growth of their business, leveraging the Apacheta technology, but also some really innovative solutions. They have a new apps for patients that they lines around the conference call with MedTrade and some of these improvements lead to incredible benefit for our home medical equipment customers and therefore allow Brightree to grow not only their share, but their share of accounts within that share. So, I see really a good profile of double-digit growth across our Software-as-a-Service platform on an organic basis as we look forward over the coming fiscal years. Operator : Your next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Thanks and good evening and good afternoon everyone. May be just staying on Software-as-a-Service, couple of questions there and then just one on France and Japan. So, on Software-as-a-Service, I guess, is there any way to actually give the kind of contribution on the MatrixCare and Apacheta in the quarter? But more importantly as we look into 2019, the remainder of the year, obviously that 63% overall versus mid-single-digit for core Brightree is notable. So, can you give maybe a little bit more color on how to layer those two in as we progress through fiscal 2019? And then I have a follow-up. Michael Farrell : Yes. Sure. Yes, clearly, that 63% number is inorganic and organic. Anthony, we don't give detailed guidance across our home businesses. So, therefore, we are not going to give detailed guidance within that sector. But as you're thinking sort of across and modeling out that portfolio, it's going to be solid double-digit growth in that Software-as-a-Service entity throughout the coming four quarters. And then as you get to an organic basis and you look at just very solid double-digit and very high margin growth from new additions like MatrixCare, I think you can model out a very strong growth of that whole portfolio. And our goal is actually not just to have these businesses managed as they are, which are great separate entities growing well organically. But some of the best benefits are going to come from interoperability of people moving from care setting to care setting and that we'll be able to get benefit from customers who have people who are in the skilled nursing facilities then move to home health and hospice and back and forth. And so we don't expect to just have these entities manage good individual double-digit growth, high-margin growth businesses, but something that ResMed managing now is strategic, the biggest portfolio of out-of-hospital software that we will be able to grow across that portfolio. We've got really strong plans as I outlined towards our 2025 strategy to be the global leader in there. Operator : Your next question is from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gretel Janu : Thanks very much. So just a question on the R&D spend. I was wondering if you can split out how much of that is for data and improving that cloud connected offering. And if you expect it, like, you have given slightly higher guidance going forward than previously, is that because of the data spend? Michael Farrell : Brett, do you want to have a first go at that and I can cover up on maybe some of our -- the strategically where we're investing in those funds? Brett Sandercock : Yes, sure. Yes, so, I mean, we wouldn't flag it across the whole portfolio, Gretel, but we, obviously, we've been in quite a bit in the SaaS area as well and R&D there. And if you look at the guidance where I push that R&D as a percentage of revenue, it's going up a little bit. That really reflects the acquisition and reflects really the percentage of revenue. Typically the SaaS businesses would spend more on R&D as a percentage of revenue. So, I did that to take the guidance to reflect that. Operator : Your next question is from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions. When you say that Japan and France is going to continue to be a headwind for the next couple of quarters and then the segment will return to market growth, what's market growth? Michael Farrell : So, Joanne, market growth is mid to high single-digits, right, for the global sleep apnea business and so we don't split that out country-by-country, but we do sort of talk about the devices side towards the mid-single-digits part and the masks side as towards that high single-digit part. And that's market growth, if you just wait for these patients to show up at a doctor's clinic or a sleep lab. As you know, Joanne, you've been following us for a number of years; we're investing very heavily in geographies for identification, engagement, and enrollment. Not just through our new partnerships, but through our awareness programs and driving patients in. And so we plan to beat that in every country we're in, but market growth is in that mid to high single-digits if you just wait for the patients to show up. Operator : Your next question is from John Deakin-Bell with Citigroup. Your line is open. John Deakin-Bell: Good morning. My question is just on the U.S. mask growth, plus 11% is quite a strong quarter. You didn't talk about the -- on a ReSupply contract that you put in place, which we spoke about last quarter. Can you just give us an update on whether there's been an expansion of that in the last quarter? Or whether it's really just on a mask launches that have given such a strong U.S. mask growth? Michael Farrell : Yes, look, it really was great growth across U.S., Canada, and Latin America. I'll hand Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep business. Do you want to talk about mask growth in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America? Jim Hollingshead : John thanks for the question. Mask growth, I think, is driven by a couple of things. One is the new product launches are very strong, doing very well everywhere we launch them. And we're getting great feedback both from our HME and healthcare provider customers globally, and also from patients. So, the new launch is doing very well. And then ReSupply continued at a very healthy clip. We don't break up those numbers and we don't talk about specific ReSupply contracts, for example, but we're happy both in new product and in ongoing ReSupply. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much for taking my question. Just, obviously, post-quarter you've launched Mobi. Just trying to understand the go-to-market strategy, you say we earned the pilot that you were looking at warranty and finance options? Michael Farrell : Yes, Andrew. So, look, we launched Mobi, a full product launch, really excited about the business. Rob, do you want to talk a little about -- Rob, our COO. Rob Douglas : Yes. So, Andrew, we ran the controlled product launch for a fair bit at the back end of last year. January 8, we announced a full market launch. So, it's early days in terms of the full market launch. Our go-to-market strategy, as we said, we think the best way to go to market is utilizing the capabilities of our existing partners, the home medical equipment providers in the industry. They're the ones with the close contacts with the patients and access. And we continue to work closely with those players in the market and we think that, as we said, will be an excellent approach. We're actually not copying anyone else's strategy to market. We do have ideas around the challenges around reimbursement and the challenges around funding these products there. But we probably wouldn't put them out on the call. That will be developed and build through the relationships that we have in the market. But in summary, we're very happy with the early days and we're happy with the product performance as well. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Wong-Pan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Craig Wong-Pan: Hi there. My question is on rest of the world mask. I was wondering, have the new mask that you released last year, so it's not the AirFit N30i, have those masks released last year been launched in all your rest of the world market or is there still markets to release those mask in? Michael Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, Craig. And yes, every geography is different in the speed and rate at which the product is approved and released passed on to distributors, presented to patients, doctors, and the whole ecosystem. And so in the U.S., it tends to be a little faster. So, we literally just launched a product, I think you're talking about the N30i. That press release went out this week. So, we just launched that within the U.S. And so that has had zero traction in the other countries around the world. It's just out. And so we'll start to see that pick up over time in terms of a material impact on ResMed over the coming quarters. But you'd expect to see, in the U.S., some early payers on that. I think when you said existing mask; maybe you're referring to the N20 and F20 masks that I also talked about in my prep remarks. Yes, they are available globally and have had traction. And they led to -- contributed to that 10% global growth within the masks category that we saw on a constant currency basis. It was 11% within U.S., Canada, and Latin America. It was also a very strong 8% within the other markets, but you don't have every country in the world at full speed on the N20, the F20, and the F30 as yet. They launched and they're driving up in those markets, but it's progressing at scale as they get introduced to distributors, to doctors and to the market. So, look, the way I'd summarize it there, Craig, is that there's a long runway ahead for our growth in markets outside the U.S., Canada, and Latin America and also along growth within those geographies for different reasons and a different, sort of, flap speeds. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Cooper : Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can I just come back to Brightree, please? So, if I understood you correctly, last quarter you'd launched a set of new modules and functionality and you had expected Brightree to pick up in the second quarter. But if anything, it does sound like you've kind of slowed sequentially down to, sort of, this mid to high-single-digit level that you talked about. So, not really clear from your comments today what's been developed proprietary on an organic basis in the way that you talked last quarter. Can you just help us understand that? Michael Farrell : Yes, Chris. And so what we expected last quarter -- so you show modules, so I think during the last quarter we were at MedTrade and so we were showing models to people. They get experience with them. They've got to be adopted by the respiratory therapist. They've got to be adopted by the doctors. If it's on the GoScript side, they've got to be adopted by patients for this new app that we have for patients. And so it's not an immediate effect. And so if you introduce a product this quarter, you don't get an immediate bump next quarter. This is a monthly recurring revenue, quarterly recurring revenue business. So, it's -- once you have a customer, it's very easy to keep them. Once you have a new product, you've got to take time to get customers to adopt it. And so there's an adoption cycle there. So, what I said earlier in the prep remarks and in previous questions is that, I think, to get from that, sort of, single-digits back to strong double-digit growth within Core Brightree business is something that the team has a plan. And they're going to execute to it and I have a strong confidence in it. I'm not saying March 31st is the day that'll happen, but December 31st, absolutely, we'll start to see those products be adopted and put through there. So, it's sort of the speed at which these things get adopted in Software-as-a-Service isn't a 90-day cycle. It's more a 180 or 365-day cycle. And then you increase the users, the number of users and you increase the cost per user, and the revenue comes along with that. But it all comes with the value of those products. And the reason it's a long sales cycle is you've got to get the solution in there. You've got to prove the value to customers and then they have to increase the number of users and grow their share. So, it's maybe a longer cycle than if you thought we were talking about a 90-day turn for a new product. It's more on the 180, 360-day term. Operator : Your next question is from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, quickly, let me ask a very high-level question. The math indicates over the last three years -- three-plus years, you'll have spent close to $2 billion. And that is approximately give or take $250 million in topline numbers that have been added on. I know some haven't been disclosed, but that's essentially what the rough math has indicated. I guess, my question is the impact on growth -- the impact on gross margins, we can decipher that. How do you look on your acquisition strategy? When does the law of diminishing return set in? And what metrics are you using internally to say, you know what we have packed on enough, I think, so we need to digest it. If you could give us a sense of that that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking my question. Michael Farrell : Yes, thanks for the questions, Suraj. Yes, clearly, we've invested, including Brightree and MatrixCare line, $1.5 billion of investment into our Software-as-a-Service vertical and we're actually really excited about that. The acquisition is driven by three things. Number one is our strategy to be the world leader in digital health in sleep apnea and in digital health for COPD and in out-of-hospital software, and to be the best at all those. As I said actually at JPMorgan earlier this month and have continued to talk about, as we launch our 2025 strategy, I think we've assembled a very strong portfolio of out-of-hospital software assets. And so we do plan to drive more integration, leverage, and interoperability to provide great value to customers in that out-of-hospital space to grow that business. So, we're really excited about the growth of that business. What you didn't mention is the Propeller investment, which actually isn't in that software side, but it's in the digital health of COPD side. If you're the CEO of hospital or you are the Health Minister looking at your top five diseases, COPD is number one, two or three in the chronic diseases you need to address. And so I think that is a strategic investment that Propeller is not providing immediate revenue right there, working on their revenue models with the pharmaceutical companies and establishing what those are in terms of driving adherence to those medications. But the outcome that could happen to global healthcare systems and the savings we could have is absolutely dramatic. And so we don't just look at it on a financial basis to say, okay, we invested $1.5 billion, that's enough. We'll get the return on that. We say, have we built the world's best digital health solution for sleep apnea? Yes. Let's keep driving that and keep growing that. Can we build the world's best digital health solution for COPD with Propeller in our core ventilation cloud connected assets? Yes. So, Richie and his team is going to execute on that. And can we, in the Software-as-a-Service side, be able to have the world's -- at least for now, the U.S. is best system, software system for out-of-hospital software care? Yes. And so we're driving growth on that. We are going to get a strong financial return from those. And I think you've seen that over the last three years. With Brightree, we've done well, and we've got a position to grow that Core growth back. We're going to even add on to that with MatrixCare and with Propeller and with Apacheta. Operator : Your next question is from David Low with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. David Low : Thanks very much. Just, look, my question is really along the same lines, but could you talk a little bit about what Apacheta is? And then sort of a bigger picture perspective, do you have plans to -- for further acquisitions or are you really in a digestion stage now? Thanks. Michael Farrell : So, I'll hand to Rob to talk about the functionality of Apacheta within -- and how it drives Core Brightree growth. And then, Brett, you can maybe answer the other part of David's question. Rob Douglas : Well, so, just a bit of background. Apacheta has been a long-time partner of Brightree and they had been working closely together. And they had a really good solution, really supporting the logistics of the HME customers and how they manage deliveries and getting our people into the right environment in the home, and just that part of the HME business has a real support. And so that becomes a very good module of Brightree. And we felt that having Brightree being able to control the development agenda in that business, the R&D agenda in it and integrating it better with the other Brightree modules, we could incrementally add value to the whole Brightree offering. So, that's an exciting add-on module, if you like, for Brightree. Brett, in terms of scope and the size of it? Brett Sandercock : Yes, I mean, it's a kind of a classic within the SaaS business on that stage. So, it's pretty deminimus at the moment, but I think the real attraction for us is the capability enhancement for the Brightree offerings and really being able to run that kind of capability, let's call it module, through Brightree's potential customer base and existing customer base. So, I think from those classic assets, it's worth much more in our hands rather than standalone. So, we think, yes, a really good type of technology capability acquisition for us. But in terms of revenue profit, it'd be pretty deminimus at the moment. Operator : Our last question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sean Laaman : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. With the new U.S. bid rates in place, I don't know, Mick, if you can give us a bit of color around pricing in the market and where you think ultimately Fed rates will go with the new rules in place? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question Sean. And yes, the new U.S. bid rates in there and they actually had a Consumer Price Index increase, the couple of percentage points for our customers, which is really good relief for our U.S. customers after a number of years of different interactions with CMS. Look, the pricing environment is incredibly steady. It's in a very steady and stable environment. We are working with our large, small, regional, and mom-and-pop customers. Having solutions like Brightree and working with our customers on scalable solutions to contact their patients, to deliver to their patients, and to manage their businesses, I think we've been able to, as an industry, take a lot of cost out of the delivery of sleep apnea and COPD therapy within U.S. geography. And therefore, we've been able to have a much steadier pricing environment this last year or two than the year or two maybe before that. And as we look forward, we expect that to continue or even get slightly better with, for the first time, in a decade, really, price increases for consumer price index within the CMS space. Operator : We are now at the one-hour mark, so I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Michael Farrell : Great. Well, thanks, Chris and thanks to our global team, 6,500 ResMedians, who sometimes listen to this call as well as our investors. You guys have been helping people with digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, and out-of-hospital healthcare that has just changed the market and we look forward to continuing to do that. We'll talk with you again in 90 days and I'll hand back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Sounds good. Thanks Mick. Thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. If you do have additional questions, please feel free to contact us directly. As mentioned at the beginning of the call, the webcast replay, along with the earnings release, and investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations website. Chris, you may now close the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2019 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Julie. Good afternoon and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's third quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. As Julie said, this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's earnings press release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Amy and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I will review top level financial results, some business highlights, and a few key milestones from the quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who is with me here in Sydney, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. Before I get into the details, I would like to discuss ResMed's long-term strategy and our goal to include $250 million lives in 2025. Driven by a number of macro change such as an aging population, the increasing impact of chronic disease, chronic healthcare costs and a move towards digital transformation in healthcare. We see very exciting opportunities for ResMed. Our goal is to empower people to live healthier lives outside of the hospital. Today there were a numerous pain points in existing care delivery models and in the quality of patient care that ResMed can address. You'll know healthcare costs are growing faster than GDP in many countries. And there aren't enough doctors to treat the people who need to be treated. When you couple that with the difficulty of getting the right care at the right time, delivering that health care in low cost setting and even further changes in challenges with interoperability, documentation, and clinical data availability. It's a global healthcare system that is in the costs. When solutions in a microeconomic side, with ResMed's global leadership in digital health for sleep apnea or COPD and for outside of the hospital healthcare, we believe that these are problems that ResMed can solve faster and better than our competitors, providing superior value for our customers. With that backdrop, I would like to quickly review our financial results. We achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth. We were up 12% in U.S dollar terms, and up 15% in constant currency terms. We benefited from a full quarter of revenue contribution from one of their latest acquisitions, MatrixCare. We also drove constant currency growth in domestic as well as international device styles. Additionally, we had a very strong growth in masks and other accessories. Now I will talk some of the new mask orders a little lighter. We delivered operating leverage with Non-GAAP operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a lot of about 89 things. We are proud of the top line and bottom-line performance from the global ResMed team. We expect to continue that success as we maintain fiscal discipline and invest in long-term growth of the global ResMed's business. Now let's turn to a discussion of highlights across our sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. And with MatrixCare businesses. In the device's product category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency growth of 6% globally, supported by 8% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America in the category. We also achieved a return to constant currency growth for devices in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to cycle through strong year-over-year comparisons in both France and Japan, which were as a result of the digital health related reimbursement changes in those countries let drove the acceleration of the vast fleet device upgrades as the last number of quarters. Underlying patient activity in all geographies remains very healthy. The masks and accessories side of our business was robust during Q3 growing globally at 13% in constant currency. In the U.S., Canada and Latin American geographies, masks markets grew at 13%. And in the Europe, Asia, and rest of world geographies, we grew at 12% in constant currency terms in masks. We continue to see excellent traction with the AirFit F20 in the full size category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category. Our recent mask launches of the F30, the N30i and the P30i are all doing very well. Let me provide a little bit of color on each of these innovative products. During October we launched the AirFit F30. This is an exciting innovation in the minimal contact full-face mask category. In January, we announced broad availability of our first tube up mask, the AirFit N30, which is in the nasal category. Both of these new masks, the F30 and the N30i contributed to our strong mask growth in Q3. After quarter end, just last month, we announced the launch of the AirFit P30i. This is a new tube up pillows options that complements our highly successful over many years P10 masks. I have personally worn ResMed's nasal pillows technology for my own sleep apnea care every night for many years. A few years ago I thought nothing could beat the Swift FX, the pillows technology. Then I upgraded a few years ago to the P10. I\u2019m now looking forward to personally upgrading to the P30i, which has freedom of movement and the ability to enjoy better sleep. We believe that many other type sleep apnea patients not just the CEO, who have the same excitement after experiencing the P30i. All these recent mask launches are important additions as we expand our mask portfolio to offer even more options to physicians and home care providers and are ultimately for the varying needs of the ultimate customer, a person who is suffocates every night. We remain focused on driving innovation to make underserved customer needs. We have an exciting product pipeline. We are the industry leader in digital health technology. We announced supporting well over 10 million patients with AirView, our trial-based patient management system. And more than 9 million 100% cloud connectable ResMed devices in the market. Over the past 12 months, we've improved the lives of nearly 15 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD devices and full mask systems. Our industry is changing, AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software ecosystem are still seeing strong adoption. Our device market share continues to grow as healthcare providers and patients choose and physicians prescribe ResMed solutions. Our digital health technology solutions have been proven to improve both business, efficiencies and patient outcomes. We are clearly the market leader, but we will never stop innovating in this space. The success of our connected health devices is producing an incredible data engine. We now have over 4 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data in the cloud. This was twice as many nights as we had just a year-ago. We're truly driving exponential digital health growth. Using advanced analytics, we are turning this clinical big data into clinical actionable insights. We are focused on developing solutions to get the right healthcare, to the right patient, at the right time. And always more cost-effectively for all our customers. Everything we do supports our ambition to help more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and the nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As we expand our digital health platforms, one of that goals has been to take the success we've had with myAir and AirView in sleep apnea and replicate that within our respiratory care business vertical. Did I -- many patients with COPD and other respiratory condition, aren't getting the treatment that they made until it's too late. There are some frequent fliers at the hospital. We believe that technology combined with the medical equipment used to treat patients can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. Digital end-to-end solutions, connectivity, making information available to that ultimate customer, on their own smartphones and supporting patients through their the COPD, the disease progression to make a huge difference. Through digital health technology we are driving guidance with patients so I can benefit from the best therapy before it's too late. We've made good progress with cloud connectable AirCurve devices for noninvasive ventilation. And with Astral devices that have cloud connectable options for lot support ventilation. Noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions, three, -- Stage III and stage four COPD patients. Those were the insights of this dreadful disease. To meaningfully drive improved patient and clinical outcomes, our strategy growth and products had expanded to take a more holistic longer tubular view of the CFE patients journey. And to offer solutions for therapy and support through earlier stages of COPD. So that we can be there for the COPD patient from stage 1 all the way through to stage IV4 of their disease. In early January, we moved Mobi, our premier portable oxygen concentrator, to a full product launch. Mobi best meets the needs of users and what to be mobile and enjoyed healthy active lives outside their home. Early results have met our expectations. We are about to commence sales of Mobi through our German team. In the U.S., we are working in partnership with our HME customers to grow this category, the healthcare system reimbursed patients. And to use portable oxygen in situations where portable solution benefit the patient must. We also continue to test pilot and refine other potential go-to-market models with the ultimate goal to ensure that patients has the most efficient mask to a portable oxygen solution. We expect the POC category to grow given very strong patient demand. We also expect that revenue will grow its share within the POC category. I want to be clear that we will take a long while for POC to be material mixed through our core sleep apnea and our core ventilation device businesses. So it's a long road ahead, During the quarter, we added another significant element to our vision for longitudinal solutions in Respiratory Care when we closed on the previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health in January. Propeller's digital health solutions, help people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma. We are hoping with this new addition to round out ResMed's portfolio to treat COPD patients through all stages of their disease as I mentioned earlier. But that was sophisticated digital health platform leverage a small sensors that are attached to the pharmaceutical and higher ones. Along with a sophisticated cloud-based mobile application that automatically tracks the medication use and provides personal feedback, coaching, and insights to the individual, much like our sleep apnea patient engagement system just north of the same scale. Propeller's clinically validated solutions have demonstrated incredible outcomes. Including a 58% improvement in pharmaceutical adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free guide, a 53% reduction in emergency room visits. These are truly impressive pilot results and we cannot wait to scale them. In the same way we scale our digital medical device, ecosystem in sleep apnea and COPD to now 4 billion nights of medical data. Propeller is operating as a standalone entity with its dynamic and innovative management team is doing quite. It's gone through in San Francisco. We are working with the propeller CEO, David Van Sickle, and his team to continue their momentum towards commercial style with the pharmaceutical customers as well as their health insurance customers. We had a board meeting last month and I\u2019m going to tell you I\u2019m very encouraged by the progress we are seeing. Earlier this quarter, Propeller announced publicly a partnership with Orion, which is a pharmaceutical company in Finland, and we\u2019re going to connect the propeller digital health platform to align easy and hyaline for both asthma and COPD patients. Propeller Health is at the beginning of converting from pilot to scale and commercialization. We will empower the team to grow and to scale and bring all our skills to the table. The opportunities are vast. There are more than 60 million diagnosed COPD and after half of the patients in the United States and major markets in Europe alone. Maybe these patients could benefit from Propeller Solutions and Propeller is the clear leader in digital health for inhaled pharmaceuticals. The evolution we\u2019ve made in our Respiratory Care business, I think is game changing. We are now even better positioned to become the global leader in digital health for COPD from stage I and stage 2 as well as our existing client Stage III and Stage IV COPD. We will continue to help physicians, providers, payers and patients as they manage this important progressive chronic disease. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of our software-as-a-service business. And then I will hand over to Brett. The software-as-a-service portfolio continues its trajectory of excellent growth with revenue up 101% year-on-year on a reported basis, driven by continued expansion of Brightree and Healthcare first along with the first full quarter of contribution from our acquisition of MatrixCare. On a pro forma basis compared to results in Q3 to the results of those visiting businesses before the acquisition, Brightree is growing in the mid to high single-digit range. And MatrixCare is growing at the low double-digit growth range. Overall we see significant growth opportunities for these fast [ph] businesses serving the out of hospital healthcare space with a lot of runway ahead. The total addressable market is over $1.5 billion in out of hospital SaaS in the UNITED alone. Without competitive advantages and our leading positions in multiple SaaS verticals, we expect ResMed SaaS portfolio to move from high single-digit pro forma growth to low double-digit pro forma growth over the medium term and to be sustainable at that rate for the long-term.  We\u2019ve started the process of integrating some of our SaaS portfolio assets. We recently transferred leadership of our home health and hospice offerings from Brightree and HEALTHCARE to under the MatrixCare management team. That will combine our strength in home health and hospice with private duty and beyond. This move will allow us to accelerate our product innovation and deliver a wide range of features for customers who have businesses across these verticals. It also supports our strategy of driving improved patient outcomes and business efficiencies for customers across all out of hospital healthcare settings. As our SaaS portfolio grows, I would like to reiterate the promise we made when we first acquired Brightree back in 2016. We're committed to protecting our customers business sensitive information. We\u2019ve firewalls to do just that. I founded ResMed in 30 years ago. In 1989, the company was founded on the fundamentals of honesty, integrity. You\u2019re doing the right thing forward. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done and what we will always continue to do. We\u2019ve a vision to transform and significantly improve out of hospital healthcare. We have a strategy to enable better patient care, improved clinical decision support and drive interoperability across these healthcare settings. The acquisitions we\u2019ve made of the past year, established ResMed after strategic player who is best positioned to lead this transformation in out of hospital healthcare. We now offer software solutions across out of hospital healthcare settings, from home medical equipment to home health and hospice to skilled nursing facilities, to senior living, to private duty and beyond. We're connecting capabilities across these platforms for these care settings, to help our customers be the most efficient they can be, to ultimately better serve people, to keep them out of the hospital and in a lower cost, higher quality setting of their choice as they age. And the best place is often their own home. Together with our customers and partners, we are revolutionizing how healthcare is delivered. We are building an ecosystem of integrated digital solutions and services. The ultimate goal is to help individuals, aging individuals move seamlessly between these healthcare settings. So that they and their loved ones can receive optimal care and optimal quality of life with frictionless moves wherever they live. In parallel to helping individuals we will drive superior outcomes. So physicians, pilots and providers. We\u2019ve built the portfolio, now it's up to our SaaS team to execute and ultimately deliver on the promise of this strategy. At the highest level, the mission of ResMed in our 2025 strategy is impact and improve 250 million lives in out of hospital healthcare. Our purpose is to empower people to live healthier, happier and a higher quality lives in the comfort of their own home. Our advantage comes from our focus on tech driven integrated care, from sleep apnea and COPD awareness to diagnosis, to treatment to management and then to ongoing therapy and healthcare management of chronic disease with digital health solutions. Let me close with this before I hand over to Brett. We\u2019ve delivered a strong quarter. We are well-positioned for continued success throughout last quarter of FY 9. We are just in and beyond. The continued traction of our diversified mask and device portfolio along with our expanded lifeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions for sleep apnea and COPD and out of hospital medical software, gives us confidence in our ongoing momentum as we look to the future. We\u2019ve positioned ResMed for the long-term as an innovative global leader in digital health. So we are just getting started. With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll open the ones up for Q&A. So over the table here in Sydney to you, Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $662.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 15%. Taking a closer look that geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our thousand U.S , Canada and Latin American countries with $350 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $232.3 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $191.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Mask and other sales were $168.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $155.2 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms a 3% increase. Masks and other sales were $77.1 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms a 12% increase. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales were increased by 6%. while masks and other sales increased by 13% over the prior year quarter.  Software-as-a-Service revenue for the third quarter was $79.9 million, an increase of 101% over the prior year quarter. This includes revenue from our Brightree healthcare and MatrixCare businesses. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measure adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, and purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare preferred revenue and tax related expenses associated with U.S tax reform. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles tax, related expenses associated with U.S tax reform and restructuring expenses. We\u2019ve provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the March quarter was 59.2%. Excluding the MatrixCare purchase accounting in the third revenue adjustment, now gross margins for the march quarter was 59.3% compared to 58.2% during the same quarter in the prior year. And 59.1% in Q2 FY19. Compared to the prior year and our adjusted gross margin increased by 110 basis points predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. The MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Excluding the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the MatrixCare acquisition was accretive to our gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for the reminder fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 FY gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $164.5 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 17%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.8% compared to the 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter.  Looking forward and subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 25% to the balance of fiscal year 2019. R&D expenses for the quarter were $47.6 million, an increase of $0.27 over the prior year quarter or in constant currency basis an increase of 32%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 6%, reflect the incremental investments across R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.2% compared with 6.3% in the prior year. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% of the balance of fiscal year 2019. Amortization of acquired intangibles $22.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 95% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense in the quarter was $12.8 million. Non-GAAP, GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $192 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $128.1 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.73. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the weaker Australian dollar relative to the U.S dollar which were partially offset by the weaker euro. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 23.6%. On a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%.,We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 21% to 23%. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $139.6 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $15.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $41.8 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of 53 million. On January 7, 2019 we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health for consideration of $225 million net of cash acquired and that assumes a joint venture with Verily continued operations during the quarter and we recorded equity losses of $6 million in income statement in the March quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately 7 million of equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2019, and also in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Given the recent acquisition activity and interest rate movements, I would like to update you on our expected net interest expense. Our net interest expense in Q3 FY19 was $12 million, and going forward we expect to record quarterly net interest expense in the range of $12 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. At March 31 we have $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $4.1 billion and net equity was $2 billion. Finally, in summary, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin is improving, supported by the contribution from recent set acquisitions and our ongoing efforts to drive [indiscernible] efficiencies as well as favorable product mix. Our operating costs remain well controlled even as we observed the impact of acquisitions. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q3 non-GAAP operating profit, up 15% year-on-year. We're focused on driving solid operating results, while ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Brett. Thanks, Mick. We will now turn the call to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question and if you do have additional questions, you\u2019re free to return to the call queue. Julie, we're now ready to start the Q&A section. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is on the line with the question. Michael Farrell : Sean, you might be on mute. Sean Laaman : Yes, great. Hello. Can you hear me? Michael Farrell : Yes, you need to start from the start, Sean. You were on mute, I think. Sean Laaman : Yes, sure. Yes. Okay. Mick -- well, hope you\u2019re all well everybody. On the rest of world masks, so strong number there. Were you able to talk about or give us some granularity around your experience for the upgraded devices in France and Japan and sort of how much runway is there to go on the benefit on that resupply side of the equation? Michael Farrell : Yes, it's a good question in terms of -- allow me to talk about France and Japan, what we\u2019ve done there. Look, clearly global revenue growth in masks was exceptional in the quarter, 13% constant currency globally. 13% in the U.S. Canada and Latin America and 12% across Europe, Asia and rest of world in constant currency terms. So we\u2019ve had probably 4 to 5 plus quarters of upgrades in France and similarly in Japan. And as we said in the prepared remarks and we said last quarter and the last number of quarters, we are going to be facing a headwind of the device sales in both France and Japan, although we're now through to get a modest positive on the rest of world devices this quarter. But it allows us through that upgrade of digital health assets in both France and Japan to now start interacting with patients and driving patient behavior through apps like myAir and with physicians through solutions like AirView and the whole Air Solutions portfolio. And so we believe there's long-term sustainable mask growth that we can achieve in both France and Japan that should help continue to grow out share which is quite high already in those geographies. But look, we are not done with it. We -- obviously, in the last five years, brought digital health in the United States and now to France and Japan with 120 other countries worldwide that we now need to start that opportunity on, but yes, it's certainly great growth in masks in the quarter off the back of digital health, but also off the back of some great mask launches. Sean Laaman : Sure. Thanks, Mick. And just one follow-up. A lot of activity there with the integration of the software platforms. Just wondering though qualitatively or quantitatively if you could give us some description on some of the financial benefits of those, that integration process that we might see? Michael Farrell : Yes. Sean, look we always think about that driving investment in digital health technology and it drives such good growth of the core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care devices. And as I\u2019ve mentioned just now also growth of the core masks and accessories. We have a lot of internal models. I\u2019m not prepared to share how those internal models of digital health technology are catalyzing growth of those areas that\u2019s what I\u2019m prepared to talk about is our public segmentation of the SaaS business which is powered by the same digital health technology capability. And that part of that portfolio grew a 101% including acquisitions. But as I said on the pro forma basis, it was growing at high single-digit range and we think over time we can optimize that digital health tech and that SaaS portfolio to grow in the low double-digit on a sustainable basis as we look at multiple years towards that 2025 strategy, we think that\u2019s a big part of it. Thanks for your question, Sean. Sean Laaman : Yes, thank you, Mick. Operator : Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse is on the line with a question. Gretel Janu : Hi. Thanks very much. So just on rest of world devices, would you be able to give a little bit more about the breakout in terms of the performance of Japan and France in the third quarter? And then just in terms of the other rest of world countries, were there any other surprises in results? Michael Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, Gretel. Look, I -- we don\u2019t -- we already breakout a lot of information when we say all the different categories we go down to, but I\u2019m happy to talk -- put some color on to the Europe, Asia and rest of world countries. Look, as I mentioned in the prep remarks, it was a great expansion in France and Japan these last number of quarters. But that great expansion and extraordinarily high share that we\u2019ve achieved there now means that you\u2019re going to slow down in both [indiscernible] have already been upgraded on the device side. Look, yes, as we saw the total Europe, Asia, rest of world growth was in that sort of modest positive on the CC and slightly negative on the headline number the U.S dollars given currency movements. Look, we expect that part -- that aggregate portfolio to grow in that type of rate as we move forward. There will be some lumpiness up and down over time, but the device side of that portfolio is given -- a little up and down in Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world over the next number of quarters as I think we addressed last quarter and most of sell side analysts have put in there. But as we move forward and we start to lap those fleet upgrades, we will get back to what we are doing, which is core patient growth. That is very strong in both France and Japan and throughout the rest of the countries we have there. And that\u2019s what\u2019s the real determinant of long-term growth. How do we get 900 million people suffocating to realize they are suffocating and getting into the system talk to their doctor and get diagnosed and treated. And that flows need to be pretty steady in Europe, Asia and rest of the world. So, yes, there will be some lumpiness in device sales here as we left France and Japan, but we will get back to growth. But yes, -- so I\u2019m not going to give detail on China, Germany and all the other countries until and when there's a digital health upside in one of those countries and then we will become material element and I look forward to doing that really. Gretel Janu : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : David Low from J.P. Morgan is on the line with a question. David Low : Thanks very much. If we could just start with the commentary around the Software-as-a-Service business. Mick, you\u2019re suggesting that they return to low double-digit growth is the medium-term or long-term aspiration. I was just wondering if you would talk a little bit to Brightree versus the long-term postacute care space? Would I be right in assuming that the long-term postacute care growth opportunity is quite a lot larger than Brightree just given how immature it is? Michael Farrell : Yes, I think -- look, there's runway still ahead, David, in the core Brightree business of home medical equipment. There's just so many efficiencies that we can have their, but yes as you know as I\u2019ve said, the quarter mid to high single-digit growth. I don\u2019t think we can get that path, even just a Brightree path to the high single digits and probably not brushing up and touching the low double-digit growth within that Brightree home medical equipment segment, because this is just so many efficiencies to gain. A little bit of market share again, we\u2019ve good market share. But it's more about bringing in modules the capabilities that take [indiscernible] away from our home medical equipment companies and bring such values that we can then share in some of that value creation. But, yes, look, the $1.5 billion addressable market includes many other out of hospital verticals. We are already playing in around seven of them and at scale at least through, like we\u2019re in home health and hospice at scale now. I\u2019m really excited about the Brightree, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare assets all being combined. And John Vanguard and his team out there in Minneapolis, I think they\u2019re going to do a great job in that vertical, home health and hospice. And additionally that same team working in skilled nursing facilities where we already have a strong position, but a lot of runway for growth. I think one of the things that ResMed brings that\u2019s unique is we're a strategic player and we\u2019re going to converting capabilities like cybersecurity, our management of AWS, Azure and all the cloud-based systems around managing that digital portfolio that we can bring superior value to it. But look, it's really a portfolio, Brightree will be a good part of that growth. MatrixCare will be a good part of that growth and we\u2019re looking to continue to grow as we empower that team. Roger has been doing a great job. David Low : Great. Thanks very much for that. Just my other question, big picture the growth that we saw from ResMed, like in your traditional sleep business looks very strong across but devices and masks. I think we would hesitate or extrapolate that out in rest of world as well, if you want to pull out the impact in France and Japan. Just would like your thoughts on where the market growth is picking up, or whether you think this is being a large or significant contribution from market share guidance? Michael Farrell : Yes, it's interesting, David. And you\u2019ve followed the same other companies that I did to try and track it. We got some really good market share data in some of that geographies and less good in others. Look, I look at out at this quarter we had constant currency growth of devices globally 6% and we had constant currency growth of masks of 13%. Traditionally, we say and I think it's still true that devices sort of growing in that mid-single digits and masks going at the high single-digits. So that would imply that we took some modest share in devices. Obviously, geographies outside France and Japan we already took the share there. And in masks, I think the N30i, the F30, we didn't even count any of the P30i, but that 13% growth is -- its clearly including some share growth as well. We love the game of innovating, small, quiet, more comfortable, more connected devices. It's a competitive game that, yes, we are winning more than we\u2019re losing. Thanks for your questions, David. David Low : Thanks. Operator : Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee is on the line with a question. Andrew Goodsall : Good morning and thanks very much for taking my question. Just on Mobi, you haven't called that out separately, just if you could characterize any contribution or feedback around the quarter? And also your move to go direct-to-consumer with OEM for Mobi? Michael Farrell : Yes, Andrew thanks for the question. As I said in the prep remarks, the whole POC category, even if we had a 100% share, we would struggle to be material to our business. We are starting from a very early stage, Mobi, we\u2019re just sort of flipping to a full product launch as we move forward. And as I said, we\u2019re very closely partnering with our home medical equipment provider customers. And what we are looking to do is find patients that qualify, and if they qualify for the reimbursement versus Medicare or private insurance, we are working with our HME customers to provide that lead, if you like that person who is in need of a POC and to have them provide great care for that person. Two of our competitors have been -- one of them for many years and one for a period of time, experimenting with models that completed the genre on that reimbursed business and going direct to patient. We have stayed away certainly from competing with our customers in the reimburse business in the United States. It's not our game and we have been doing that plan to do that. In the case that a person who wants to buy a device by cash, we are at quality in different models, we've been, in the way the two competitors are. I think it would be foolish not to take care of the ultimate customer who is a patient, who needs when two other players in the market are doing that. But it's very early days in this. I\u2019m going to say that the opportunities that is huge for us and we think of it as a longitudinal play across COPD. POC is an interesting part of a big journey of a COPD patient. We want to talk to the patient in stage 1, stage 2 through digital health and inhalers. That\u2019s about 80% plus of the cost of the COPD patient is in the pharmaceutical side. So Propeller Health is the one that we should be talking about as a material element. I think with POC, noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, we are already in that. And it's exciting, but it's really that long-term play of the patient through digital applications [indiscernible] of hospital, to keep them happy, so that their physician's happy, that the health insurance company is happy, that the caregiver, everyone is happy and also that our customers are under and [indiscernible] equipment customers can be happy. As a reimbursed patient, we want to take care of it. Andrew Goodsall : Very good. Thank you. And just my follow up, just obviously GM, half of that was -- you attribute to metrics. The other half I presume is predominantly mixed with the higher growth in the U.S? Brett Sandercock : Yes, hi, Andrew. It's Brett. The -- it's probably -- there is meaningful impact probably from the some production efficiencies in Q1 efficiency [indiscernible] that we\u2019re driving for maybe would like 30, to add. And then obviously product mix was favorable, and that was a meaningful impact on that as well. Andrew Goodsall : Terrific. Thank you very much. Michael Farrell : Thanks for your questions, Andrew. Operator : David Bailey from Macquarie, is on the line with quarter question. David Bailey : Hey, good morning. Just a quick one for me. [Indiscernible] up on the gross margin, just wonder if you can quantify the impact to currency on gross margin on a year-on-year basis. Michael Farrell : Yes, year-on-year was favorable around COPD POC license points. And in -- at a sequentially it was basically pretty negligible. David Bailey : On the context of the 50 basis points your refer to early are you probably looking around 10% -- 10 basis points organic gross margin expansion with the year-on-year. Excluding currency? Brett Sandercock : Yes, and actually on currency, it's actually pretty negligible on both actually. If I look at year-on-year, correct that. It's pretty eligible [indiscernible]. And really [indiscernible] because we still [indiscernible] to see the all these are real types of [indiscernible] I would call for the [indiscernible]. And lastly I said [indiscernible]. David Bailey : Okay. Thanks. Michael Farrell : Yes. Operator : Saul Hadassin from UBS is on the line with a question, Saul Hadassin : Thanks. Good morning. Just one question from me. Mick, the U.S. masks growth rate [indiscernible] ahead of market growth again. Can you talk to how much of that is resupply growth, an acceleration in resupply as opposed to success on new product launches. I mean, we have the impression that masks that redeployed the vast majority of your U.S [indiscernible] you talk to what you\u2019re seeing in the dynamic between resupply growth versus share shift that would be great. Michael Farrell : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. We have Jim Hollingshead, the Head of our Global Sleep business on the line. Jim, you want to talk to as much cover you can gave on U.S growth organic etcetera. Michael Farrell : Yes, sure. Thanks, Mick, and thanks for your question, Saul. I think the answer is both in. We are seeing very strong results of resupply and we\u2019ve seen that over the last several quarters as more and more of our HME customers have adopted automated resupply solutions. So that continue to be very strong. return results for us and for customers with the new products have also -- all gotten off to a terrific start. F30 is out of the gate very strong, N30i has a terrific patient preference and is doing very, very well and early result from P30 are also extremely encouraging. So I think we are getting both organic growth and we are taking some share in this space, but we\u2019re also enjoying very good results for the resupply. Saul Hadassin : Thank you. Operator : Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on the line with a question. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon everybody and thank you for this quarter after the last quarter experience. Anyway two quick questions. What was the total acquisition revenue impact on the fiscal year third quarter. And then the second question is how do we think about operating leverage in the coming quarters and maybe even for next year? Thank you. Michael Farrell : Well, I will jump to the operating leverage, I will hand to Brett to talk about sort of organic versus acquisition driven growth. But look Joanne as we\u2019ve been -- as you and other sell-side analysts have challenged us, that is, one is the ongoing leverage. And it's really our challenge to ourselves to ensure that we can achieve ongoing leverage and I think we\u2019ve had a good performance in the last number of quarters to that end. The operating programs, the business excellence programs, we put in place the drive with [indiscernible] manufacturing team, the [indiscernible] advanced manufacturing teams that I'm here on site with this week are all doing excellent work in that. Our commercial teams and looking at how to use digital health technology for the social media marketing versus old-school paper and television, really pushing the envelope of how we drive business excellence across all that functions in all our business verticals. It's something that we think is sustainable for the medium to long-term. But it's a game that never stopped throughout the game of continuous improvement and Brett, do you want to have a little discussion as to what\u2019s organic versus inorganic growth in the quarter. Brett Sandercock : Yes, Joanne, you\u2019re talking on the SaaS side? Joanne Wuensch : A number of acquisition in the last 90 to 180 days, , MatrixCare, Propeller, et cetera. Just I'm trying to piece through where all that came from. Brett Sandercock : Yes if you look at -- on a group basis, if you look at -- growth you exclude the acquisitions, we grew at around the 8% mark constant currency. I think a good way to look at it, Joanne, is that masks -- the devices and masks and accessories -- none of those acquisitions came with us. So if you think of device growth year-on-year constant currency at 6% and masks and accessories growth year-on-year 10%, that gives you an idea for absolute core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. Excluding all acquisition about -- that happened. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much. Brett Sandercock : Thanks, Joanne. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking the question. For my question, I want to focus a little bit on Brightree and some of the strategic changes may be that your guys trying to make to accelerate revenue there. And part of that is really the number of recent product and program launches that you have. So how should we view the typical sales cycle for some of these new product launches? Is it six months, nine months? And then can you give us a sense of where that revenue growth is going to come from new users versus existing accounts? Michael Farrell : Great question, Margaret. I'm going to hand that to Rob Douglas, Chief operating Officer. Rob Douglas : Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Margaret. Margaret, you know that Brightree is recurring revenue model. So we compete on booking and that then reflect in recurring revenue on the U.S. So we do have a view of that. And as we talked about, we had headwinds around a little bit of consolidation in the industry. Our approach to that has been really improve modules on it and we\u2019re really happy with the way the new Brightree modules are going, including some of the analytics offerings and certainly some of the direct patient engagement offering in Brightree. We\u2019ve got the team really focused on driving those offerings in the market. And then even on a longer term basis, we've got the team working on additional modules and development. So we are very confident that that Brightree growth will continue as it did in this quarter. We saw a decent improvement in that and we are confident that will continue. Margaret Kaczor : Thanks. Michael Farrell : Thanks for the question, Margaret. Operator : John Deakin-Bell from Citi is on the line with a question. John Deakin-Bell: My question is just around Propeller. Last quarter you said that was going to be $0.02 to $0.03% dilutive third quarter for some time. Can you just confirm that that is the case in this quarter? And just give us an update on the trajectory of that -- of the losses over the next year or two? Michael Farrell : Yes, Brett, do you want to talk to the losses \u2026? Brett Sandercock : Yes, Sure, John. Yes, so I can confirm that it was in the $0.02 to $0.03 range for this quarter. And I guess for the next little while next few quarters I think it will around that sort of level. John Deakin-Bell: That's fine. I mean, like for the whole of FY '20 is that -- are we talking about that length of time? Brett Sandercock : I mean I don't want to make progress that sort of long-term predictions like that on Propeller but I think for the next few quarters it will be around that level. Michael Farrell : The real question, John, is where that goes from down a penny to up a penny is the sales cycle of Propeller. So Propeller, as we said on the prepared remarks, are working with Orion in Finland, sort of niche pharmaceutical company. Its public that the Propeller are working with some very large pharmaceutical companies and some of them don't want us to talk about, some of them are in the archive. But if anyone of these pilots starts to commercialize, that stuff -- and they are comfortable for us talking about that publicly, how customer is, we will update you on that. And this will be very quickly from dilutive to accretive in a heartbeat, but that's obviously the play. It's a medium to long term play and we are not calling the date, the time or the hour or the quarter that, that happens. But that\u2019s what the investments are around, so that\u2019s where it like sort of as we start to get out there, those changes may happen. And so for the short term, [indiscernible] things down. For the long-term, incredibly excited for COPD patients to get better Digital Healthcare. John Deakin-Bell: Right. Good color. Thanks for that. Operator : Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning, gentleman. I just got another question on your SaaS business. And you mentioned previously about the home health market and Brightree and MatrixCare. Can you actually shed some color on how we should be thinking about the revenue synergies in the -- in your SaaS business with Brightree and MatrixCare and also on HEALTHCAREfirst? Michael Farrell : Yes, it's a good question. And the combination of those businesses, there is a number of factors. I mean, sort of basic one is that we can combine our digital health capabilities, our cyber security, cloud-based management and management team and sort of the economies of scale managing across those multiple portfolio. The big upside is that there are a number of customers, may be many thousands of customers out at hospital healthcare, that operate in multiple cities. They have a skilled nursing facility. They also have a hospice and maybe also a home health. And a lot of the players out there are small and or niche players in -- as in terms of our competitors in the SaaS space and they serve one or maybe two of those verticals. I think as ResMed now serves seven verticals, we are able to have frictionless or seamless moment of an aging person from care setting to care setting. That's good for them. It's good for the family. It's good for the health care system. It's good for the insurance company and its good for the customer. The person who is signing us on a per year to per month basis. And so that\u2019s the real upside. The synergies is on the backside, on the backend of the infrastructure, but there is also incredible synergies for the customer in ResMed being an offering that goes across those. And so we are actually [indiscernible] Healthcare first, allow us to really put it all under one umbrella and bring that value to the customer. Lyanne Harrison : Thank you. Michael Farrell : Thanks for your question, Lyanne. Operator : Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question. Chris Cooper : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Most have been asked, but perhaps if I may probably just ask one on the growth opportunity in POC since you mentioned that. Just curious if you could share your thoughts, please on how big you believe that our addressable market might be, and also what you see is a current market growth? I know you expect to outperform that through share gains, but if you could just give some sense of how big that market is and how quickly you believe it's growing right now, that would be helpful for us. Thank you. Michael Farrell : Yes, Chris, as I said in the prep remarks, it's going to take a long time for POC to get material versus other -- $2 billion plus franchise, but it is exciting as kind of the [indiscernible] top line. Rob, do you want to give a little more data as to the addressable market and/or to that share. Rob Douglas : Sure. We\u2019ve talked about addressable market over the years saying that $ 3million to -$4 million range. But it's actually changing a lot because as we\u2019ve talked about, POCs are a disruptive play to other forms of oxygen delivery. But in order for that disruption to really play out there are a few generations of technology needed. But we could see a strong market growth in that market and particularly as we introduce connected solutions and better management of products and better really management of patients. So long-term we see a lot of opportunity in growing that market, but as Mick has said in the short-term, it's going to take a long-term to be material, particularly given the growth rates of our other businesses. And we are happy with our current programs. We are really focusing on learning and the best way to support patients in the market and the best way to use the capabilities of our existing partners throughout in the market. Chris Cooper : Got it. Thanks. Just one very quick follow-up. Just on the masks side, if you were to apportion or rank their contribution that you would expect from the F30, the M30i and the P30i, over the next few quarters could just give us some sense of how big you expect each of them to be relative to one another. Michael Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, we don't go into that level of detail around new masks set up versus existing or new mask growth. But what I can tell you in terms of color is we are very excited about the initial performance of the N30i and the F30. They have shot out of the gates beautifully. The P30i wasn\u2019t even in the quarter which is launched last month. I\u2019m looking forward to opening the packet and using it myself. And I can't wait to see many, many, many others do the same. But yes, we won't that right out, but I can tell I this growth in the quarter of 13% constant currency in masks and accessories wasn't a one timer. I think we have the ability to continue to grow pretty strongly with this really strong portfolio we have. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick for closing comments. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Julie. And before we close the call, I would like to thank our dedicated 7,000 strong ResMed team in a 120 countries for their continued dedication, focus and commitment to our growth strategy and our operating excellence and business excellence initiatives. You\u2019re the core of what we do and your efforts have enabled us to deliver another quarter of strong revenue growth and solid operating leverage which allows us to reinvest back into the business to drive even further growth and progress our mission. We are focused as a team on our future platform of innovative products and software solutions to improve the outcomes and benefit all of our stakeholders. The ultimate customers, the patients, the physicians, the payers, the home care providers and governments. Thanks for all your time today. We look forward to talking to you again in 90 days at the end of our fiscal year. Back to Amy to close out. Amy Wakeham : Thank you again everyone for joining us today. If you do have additional questions, please feel free to reach out to ResMed's IR team directly.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 for ResMed. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I\u2019ll review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. Reflecting back on fiscal year 2019, we have a lot to be proud of here at ResMed. The business is performing well; we past $2.6 billion in revenue and grew at double digits in the top line and the bottom line. We are exiting the year with momentum. And I feel strongly that we are well-positioned heading into fiscal year 2020 and beyond. ResMed is the world\u2019s leading technology-driven healthcare company. We have more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices in the market around the world and our AirView cloud ecosystem monitors more than 11 million patient accounts, while our out-of-hospital software systems are helping to manage 19 million more. So, that is over 100 million lives that we improved with ResMed products, services and solutions in the last 12 months. We have over 4.5 billion nights of medical sleep and respiratory care data, which continues to grow exponentially. And we are turning these data into actionable insights that will inform future innovation in products and software solutions to further benefit our customers. Our relentless focus on innovation continues to set us apart from our competition, demonstrated by the success of our latest software releases and our latest sleep apnea mask systems that we\u2019ve just launched. We have ambitions and strong ambitions to grow. We\u2019re growing our business at -- volume at double-digits; we\u2019re going to improve 250 million lives in 2025. We\u2019ll do that by helping people live happier, healthier and high quality lives outside the hospital. We remain laser-focused on growth in our core business of sleep apnea as well as in our adjacent businesses of COPD, asthma, and other chronic conditions. We\u2019ve extended our focus to include out-of-hospital software solutions that help customers create efficiencies, take costs out of the system and improve the quality of care across home medical equipment providers, home health and hospice services as well as skilled nursing facilities and beyond. In short, we believe the future of healthcare is outside the hospital, that\u2019s where ResMed competes and that\u2019s where we win. Let\u2019s briefly now review our top level financial results. I mentioned earlier that we ended the fiscal year on a strong note, and it is, thanks to our 7,500-person global team and their hard work to drive these great results. We achieved another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 15% in constant currency. We produced constant currency growth in both domestic and international sales as well as in our software-as-a-service business, which is growing organically as well as through contributions from our recent acquisitions. We continued to deliver operating leverage through the business with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 18% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.95. Let me now turn to a discussion of highlights across our sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category across these two businesses, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency growth of 8% globally, supported by 11% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies. We had 1% constant currency growth of devices in combined Europe, Asia and the rest of world. We continue to cycle through strong year-over-year comparisons in France and Japan as a result of digital health related fleet upgrade that we\u2019ve previously discussed, and we will continue to do so for a number of quarters. Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe. ResMed is well-positioned to continue to benefit from strong fundamental market dynamics, including an ageing population as well as increased awareness and attention from governments, payers, providers and physicians to better manage chronic disease. The masks and accessories growth of our business was very strong during Q4. We were up 15% in constant currency globally. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America geographies, masks and accessories grew at 16%. And in Europe Asia, and the rest of world geographies, we grew at 12% in constant currency terms, in masks and accessories. We are taking share around the world with our latest patient interface innovations. We make the smallest, quietest and most comfortable masks in the market. Results this quarter show the benefits of this innovation as customers vote for ResMed with their wallets. Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 in the full face category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category, continue their success across global markets. Our three most recent masks launches the F30, the N30i and the P30i have taken off at an incredible pace. These market share gains are complemented by higher rates of adherence, driven by our digital solutions and increasing adoption of mask resupply programs through the market. We have extended our mask portfolio to offer even more options for physicians and homecare providers, and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. And while these new masks have a lot of runway ahead, we also have an exciting product pipeline for the future.  We are the industry leader in digital health technology. We now support well over 11 million patients with AirView, our cloud-based platform for managing sleep apnea and COPD patients. And more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable ResMed devices have installed into the market. Over the past 12 months, we have improved the lives of 15 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD treatment devices and full mask systems. Our industry-changing AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software ecosystem are still seeing strong adoption. Our device market share continues to grow as patients and healthcare providers choose ResMed and physicians prescribe ResMed. Our digital health technology solutions have been proven to improve both business and patient outcomes. We\u2019re the market leader and we will never stop innovating in this field. We believe that digital health technology combined with the medical equipment used to treat patients can add substantial value and improve both critical outcomes and the patient experience. Digital end-to-end solutions, connectivity, making information available to patients on their own smartphones through apps like myAir and Propeller, as well as supporting patients through their chronic disease progression, can altogether make a significant difference in both health outcomes and quality of life of patients. Through digital health technology, we are driving engagement with patients, so they can enjoy the benefits of the best therapy available, and so the cost of chronic disease can be better managed by their physicians and other healthcare providers. The success of our connected health devices is producing an incredible data engine. We now have over 4.5 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data in the cloud. Using advanced analytics, we are turning these clinical data into actionable insights. We are lowering labor costs for our homecare provider customers. And we are taking waste out of the system through our focus on developing solutions to get the right healthcare product or service to the right patient at the right time. At the American Thoracic Society and at the Sleep Medicine Conference during the quarter, we presented over 40 clinical studies from our digital health databases. We are advancing the field of sleep medicine with doctors Nunez, Benjafield, and Armitstead, and their physician colleagues from around the world. Just over one year ago, we announced a joint venture with the Alphabet subsidiary, Verily, to study the health and financial impacts of untreated sleep apnea. Based on research outcomes from this JV, we will develop software solutions to help identify, engage and better manage people with sleep apnea. The JV has been set up and is running since November of last year and the combined ResMed-Verily team is making good progress to analyze data, code software, and to launch pilot studies into the market. This investment, which can be seen as a sophisticated, tech-driven research and development project is a great long-term bet. Over time, we know this work will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business, while allowing ResMed to participate in a broader ecosystem, covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other major chronic diseases. Everything we do supports our ambition to help to more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea, and then nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. In January, we closed on the acquisition of Propeller Health. This is a significant addition to our vision of longitudinal solutions in respiratory care. Propeller\u2019s digital health solution helps people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma healthcare. Propeller rounds out ResMed\u2019s portfolio to now treat COPD patients through all stages of their disease. As a reminder Propeller\u2019s advanced digital health platform leverages small sensors that are attached to the inhalers of these medicines. These sensors then pair with an easy-to-use cloud-based mobile app that automatically tracks COPD medication use and provides personalized feedback and insights to the individual, much like myAir and our other sleep apnea patient engagement systems, just not at the same scale yet. The Propeller team is making really good progress, as they work with partners to reach commercial scale. We\u2019re very encouraged about where we are at with the team. There are few things that I can point to that give you an idea of how Propeller solutions have been recognized and adopted by their partners. In May, the Cleveland Clinic published research showcasing that the use of Propeller\u2019s digital medicine platform for COPD patients, reduced the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s COPD-related healthcare utilization and hospitalizations across their clinic. And the year before the study, patients averaged 3.4 visits per patient per year; following the use of Propeller\u2019s technology, the rate decreased to 2.2 visits per patient per year, with the majority of patients indicating that the sensor was convenient and very easy to use. That 35% reduction in clinic visits is an incredible cost savings and productivity opportunity for hospital systems and payers. Earlier this week, Walgreens announced that Propeller has been added to the pharmacy\u2019s health platform called, Find Care, expanding the ability to get Propeller into the hands of people struggling to manage their chronic disease through Walgreens. Propeller\u2019s clinically validated solutions have demonstrated amazing outcomes, including trial studies showing a 58% improvement in medication adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free days, as well a 53% reduction in emergency room visits. These are impressive results, and we can\u2019t wait to scale. The evolution that we have made in respiratory care business has set ResMed up to become the global leader in digital health for COPD, from stage 1 and 2 COPD with Propeller to stage 3 and stage 4 COPD, with portable oxygen and noninvasive solutions. We will continue to help physicians, providers, payers and patients as they manage COPD this important, progressive and chronic disease, keeping people out of the hospital, happy and healthy in their homes. Let\u2019s now turn to a discussion of our software-as-a-service business for the out-of-hospital healthcare settings that we operate in. Our SaaS portfolio continues its growth trajectory, with revenue up 111% year-on-year on a reported basis this quarter. On an organic pro forma basis, comparing results in Q4 to the results of these businesses before recent acquisitions, Brightree grew in the high single digit range and MatrixCare grew low double digits. We are pleased with the momentum and progress the teams have named as we integrate and optimize across the portfolio for growth. Our competitive advantages and leading SaaS positions in home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and other out-of-hospital care markets support ongoing portfolio growth. On a pro forma basis, we are growing this portfolio at high single digits across the blend of SaaS portfolio. And we have a clear pathway to drive sustainable, double-digit growth in our SaaS portfolio as we further integrate these businesses. I'd like to call out a few highlights from the quarter. Our Brightree home health and hospice electronic medical record solution was awarded the 2019 MedTech Breakthrough Award for best overall healthcare administration software. Additionally, our latest K L A S or KLAS scores for home health and hospice have gone up again. KLAS looks at many aspects of customer satisfaction, which provides a holistic measure of performance. So, the trend and these latest data further validate our leading position in high-quality offering in the marketplace. As you may recall, MatrixCare has received the best-in-class a long-term care software three years in a row. We have now organized all of our home health and hospice solutions from both HEALTHCAREfirst and Brightree under MatrixCare management. This will allow customers who operate across care settings, to enjoy the scalability and seamless transfer they want, but it also helps patients and aging seniors to navigate more easily across these healthcare settings. Additionally, we launched MatrixCare I which is a single platform for care management across out-of-hospital healthcare settings. Having a single platform, enables centralized management of care settings, consistency between functions, user management and navigation and a single view of the individual, resulting in streamlined care transitions for our customers. Also, during the quarter, Brightree launched a new pharmacy suite for home infusion therapy providers and HME pharmacies. We've also expanded our Brightree ReSupply solutions, three new categories, incontinence, diabetics and enteral to enable HMEs to create efficiencies and optimize patient support. In summary, for the SaaS business, we have a vision to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare. ResMed is the strategic player, best positioned to lead this transformation. We are connecting capabilities across Brightree and MatrixCare platforms in care settings to help our customers to be more efficient, so they can better serve an aging population, helping them stay out of hospital and in a lower cost, higher quality care setting of their choice, and the best place is almost always their own home. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We had a great fiscal year 2019. Full year revenue was up 15% in constant currency, and we translated that into 18% operating profit growth. We are all well-positioned to continue to drive top and bottom line growth in fiscal year 2020 and beyond. We published the prevalence data study showing the 936 million people worldwide with sleep apnea in the top tier clinical journal, Lancet. Our connected health strategy continues to support growth across global markets and the continued traction of our diversified mask and device portfolio along with an expanding pipeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and out-of-hospital medical software markets. We have confidence in our ongoing momentum. Finally, we\u2019ve position ResMed for the long-term as an innovative global leader in digital health. Our triple aim is to slow chronic disease progression, to reduce overall healthcare system cost, and to improve outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer, the patient. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks. And then, we\u2019ll open the lines up for Q&A. Brett, over to your in Sydney. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenues for the June quarter were $705 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, our sales in U.S. and Canada and Latin American countries were $386 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $234 million, decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 4% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $203 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $183 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $156 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms a 1% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was $79 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 12% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 4% while masks and other sales increased by 15% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-service revenue for the fourth quarter was $85 million, an increase of 111% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue, restructuring expenses, litigation and settlement expenses, tax related expenses associated with the U.S. tax reform and any payment on a minority interest investment. The prior comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and expenses associated with U.S. tax reform. And replacing that, we provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the June quarter was 59.3% compared with 58.1% during the same quarter in the prior year and 59.3% in Q3 FY19. Compared to the prior year, our gross margin increased by 120 basis points, predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, and the MatrixCare acquisition, partially offset by typical declines in average selling process. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2020 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY19 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $171.6 million, an increase of 9% over prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 14%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 3% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.3% compared to the 25.1% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% during fiscal year 2020. Consistent with trends in prior year, Q1 FY20 will be at the higher end of the range while with second half of the year will trend toward the lower end of the range. R&D expenses for the quarter were $51.1 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter, on constant currency basis an increase of 32%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 6%, reflecting incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.3% compared to 6.4% in the prior year. Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2020. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $23.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 102% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisition. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14.2 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $196.2 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $137.6 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.95, consistent with the prior year quarter while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.48. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 28.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 will be in a range of 21% to 23%. During the quarter, we recognized restructuring expenses of $9.4 million, predominantly associated with the workforce planning review in our respiratory care business, closure of our R&D facilities in Germany and cost associated with ongoing integration program in the SaaS portfolio. Additionally, during the quarter, we recognized a write-down of $5 million associated with a minority equity investment. Finally, in relation to legal settlement, we have tentatively agreed with the government to resolve the U.S. Department of Justice investigation for a payment of $39.5 million. We expect to also incur legal and administrative cost to typically accompany such a resolution. As a result, we have recognized a reserve of $41.2 million in our fourth quarter results in connection with this tentative agreement. While we believe a voluntary resolution is likely, there can be no assurance as to whether or when the parties will finalize a negotiated settlement. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $141.8 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $22.2 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42.8 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $53.1 million. Our joint venture with Verily continued operations during the quarter and we've recorded equity losses of $6.5 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity losses each quarter in fiscal year 2020, associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, representing an increase of 5% from our previously declared dividend. At June 30, we had $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.1 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. On July 10, we closed on our U.S. private placement offering with $500 million in debt, consisting of $250 million and seven-year senior unsecured notes at a 3.24% coupon and $250 million in senior unsecured notes at 3.45% coupon. Net proceeds from the offering were $498 million, which we used to reduce our current borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility. The transaction significantly lengthens our debt maturity profile and provides improved visibility on our long-term debt funding costs. Finally, to recap. Our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin was solid and our operating costs remained well controlled, even as we observed the impact of acquisitions. As a result, we're continuing to drive operating leverage with Q4 non-GAAP operating profit up 18% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic, long-term opportunities. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett. We will now go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question. If you do have additional questions or a follow-up, please feel free to return to call queue. Operator Rob, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Again, Lyanne Harrison, please go ahead. Your line is open. Lyanne Harrison : Hi Mick and hi Brett. Thank you so much for taking my questions. It\u2019s in relation to the SaaS business. Can you shed some light on how the growth was achieved, whether it\u2019s new users, new module and increase in revenue per user? And also, how you might -- or when you might expect Brightree to get to double-digit growth? Mick Farrell : Yes. Lyanne, thanks for the question. And as we said during the quarter -- or during the prepared remarks, during the quarter, we had strong growth across the SaaS portfolio, high single digit growth from Brightree and low double digit growth from MatrixCare with a blend of the two in the very high single digits. Your question of where the revenue comes from, it\u2019s a combination of the above. We\u2019ve had new users that come into the system, both Brightree and MatrixCare there is churn out but we have net new users that come in. We have also launched some recent new modules including apps directly for patients in Brightree. And then, we also have price increases that apply to some elements of that portfolio. So, it\u2019s sort of a combination of all three that have driven that strong growth. And as we said, we think as we continue to integrate across the different out-of-hospital healthcare settings, we have the opportunity to increase the value we give the customers and therefore increase the revenue to a sustainable double-digit growth across that portfolio. So, we\u2019re not giving a specific timeline exactly where that\u2019s going. But now that it\u2019s called out on our 10-Qs and 10K, we\u2019ll be going through very detail data on a 90-day basis as to where that growth is coming from. But I can tell you, having just had a steering committee review with both the Brightree management team and with the MatrixCare management team just this week that we have a really good portfolio of new solutions and services, and new lines of business including getting into infusion businesses from Brightree, into enteral care and diabetics and beyond. So, there is a very good portfolio ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell of Citi. Please go ahead. John Deakin-Bell: Good morning, Mick. Mick, just give us a bit more of a sense from your perspective about the mask growth in the U.S. [Technical Difficulty] over the last 12 months, it certainly looks like it accelerated versus kind of the average over the last five years. And [Technical Difficulty] declined a bit the volumes, the volumes [Technical Difficulty] 15%. Can you just give us a little more perspective from what you\u2019re seeing in terms of is that driven by the resupply? What are the key components of that elevated mask growth? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. That allows us to talk about what we\u2019ve been doing to help our customers on masks and adherence and so on. As you noted, our U.S., Canada, Latin America growth in the quarter was very strong, was 16% constant currency in that geography. But I\u2019ll note it was also 12% in constant currency in Europe, Asia and rest of world and so a sort of global number of 15% constant currency growth across the business. It\u2019s driven primarily by market share gains, those high strong double-digit growth there. We say the market is growing in mid to high single digits. So, at 15% growth, we\u2019re clearly taking share. So, that\u2019s one point. Secondly, what we\u2019re driving is increased adherence. As I talked at length on the prep remarks on digital health technology, we\u2019re driving upto 87% adherence on patients who set up on a ResMed device using myAir and all the Air Solutions capabilities. And so, 9 out of 10 people are staying on therapy, and so that just drives a stronger tail of the number of patients who will adhere to therapy and therefore will need masks as they get dirty and decay over time. So, that\u2019s a big part of it. So, it\u2019s the share gain, it\u2019s the adherence that we\u2019re driving and it\u2019s also getting new patients into the funnel. And we\u2019re doing a better job of identifying, engaging, enrolling patients around the world, not just by publishing the prevalence data that we just did but using the big data to partner with healthcare providers and governments and payers to show that there is a return on investments in diagnosing and treating sleep apnea patients, not only improving the quality of life of the individuals and their lives changed and lower incidence occurring disease but also directly to lower healthcare costs for government insurance and private insurance as well. So, it\u2019s sort of a combination of all three, move people into the pipeline, the pipeline expanding through adherence and also ResMed gaining its share of that pipeline through the mask innovation. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Hadassin : Maybe could I just ask, resupply seems to be a very strong driver of growth in the U.S. from masks and accessories. We\u2019ve seen the part of bundling program effectively come and go. Do you see any risks at all from a payer\u2019s perspective, the reimbursement perspective, the sustainability of funding of that product growth? Mick Farrell : So, the key element in this is really Health Economics and Outcomes Research, right, and the acronym is HEOR. And one thing we\u2019re doing with the 4.5 billion nights of medical data we now have on sleep apnea and COPD patients is partnering up with healthcare systems. You saw our data with Kaiser Permanente Group in California, which is where we published the 87% adherence data. Obviously we don\u2019t share all the partnerships that don\u2019t get published and what we\u2019re doing. We have talked about the latest work with Walgreens in there with Cleveland Clinic on some of our digital health applications. The bottom line is, if you keep a patient on therapy for sleep apnea and you\u2019re investing a couple of hundred dollars per year per patient on masks, you are saving far more than that in reducing emergency room visits, additional cost for cardiovascular care, diabetes and all those that from untraded obstructive sleep apnea. So, we\u2019ve had decades now of clinical data showing this. We now have true economic data that we can show a customer, where that customer is a payer provider system like [indiscernible] with the government of Finland, and look at data in their system with their people. So, your question was, do I see resupply as a risk? No. I see resupply as an opportunity to show the return on investment for the people who are trying that. But actually this is a cost saving, a net-net cost savings over the life of that patient with their own data, retrospective and prospective. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Wheen of Evans & Partners. Please go ahead. Steve Wheen : Hey. Good morning. I just wondered if you could go back to that settlement figure and just remind me of what the issue was. I think, this is related to that OIG issue. And does that change -- is that just an estimate at this or is it being finalized? And secondly, does it change the way you've got to run that resupply business, going forward? Mick Farrell : Steve, I'll hand that question to Rob Douglas. David Pendarvis : Steve, the conduct that was subject of investigation, has been laid out in our 10-Qs over time, so, if you just go back and reference that, will give you the detail that basically has sort of four different categories. How we made our resupply programs available on a trial basis was one element. There were issues about marketing programs, issues about financing and issues about making some apnea links available. So, all four of those would get wrapped into this resolution. It is a tentative resolution. And so, we are comfortable in taking the reserve now because we think it\u2019s probable that that resolution will get finalized. But that's likely only to occur, our best estimate now would be by the end of the calendar year that that will take place. And we are pretty confident of the numbers. The 39.5 number that Brett referenced is a confident estimate of the ultimate exposure for payments to the government. The remainder of it, the fees and expenses are a little more of an estimate, but there is a pretty high confidence level that that reserve ought to be sufficient to cover all of these expenses associated with it. Importantly, we are not going to be required in this resolution to admit any wrongdoing. In fact, we believe that we have handled ourselves appropriately. But, like in a lot of situations, you resolve matters on a consensual basis to get it behind you. And we feel it was the best resolution for our customers, our patients and for the Company and our shareholders. But going forward, we don't expect any significant changes to the way that we do business. We're going to continue to remain focused on, as Mick was saying, making resupply systems available for customers, so they can get -- patients can get adequate supplies and consumables in the future. We will still do that and in the other areas providing support to our customers and support to our patients. We don't expect any significant changes in the way we do business. Operator : Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. Please go ahead. Margaret Kaczor : Mick, on the frontend commentary, I think you had referenced your goal of double-digit volume growth over the next several years. So, I wanted to maybe go into that a little bit more, in terms of the drivers of that growth, sleep, versus COPD versus SaaS, if you plan a similar pace of product launches, maybe that we've seen, and really when does the law of large numbers, whether it\u2019s healthcare or resupply certain impact you? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Margaret. As you know that I did talk about that in the prep remarks that the way we look at our businesses is, it\u2019s exciting, the $2.6 billion in revenue, but just as exciting, probably more exciting for the people who work here is the 100 million lives we touched, 15 million through products and now over 90 million through our services and solutions in the SaaS part of the business. So, our goal is to grow that combined portfolio double-digits in volume through 2025 and beat 250 million lives that we improve in the year 2025. So, that\u2019s sort our five-year growth plan. We haven\u2019t split -- I mean, we have obviously internally, we haven\u2019t publicly split out exactly how the different elements of sleep apnea, respiratory care, primarily through COPD but also asthma now through Propeller and then also through the out-of-hospital software side and how each of those elements will grow. What I can say is that sort of core market of sleep apnea is growing mid to high single digits, as you saw this quarter and last quarter. We don\u2019t just accept market growth, we drive it by getting market share and getting new patients into the funnel to actually fundamentally improve that core sleep apnea market growth. In respiratory care, we are revolutionizing the whole space there with the acquisition of Propeller. It will only take one of the three to five non-public pharma pilot trials that we\u2019re doing to go to scale for that growth of that business to improve very significantly from its current run rate. And we\u2019re betting on that happening. We have a very exciting set of partnerships with big pharma that we can only talk about at the appropriate time. And then, the third part of our business, the combination of Brightree and MatrixCare businesses, as I said, we have a clear pathway to drive those from high single digit to double digit growth, and to sustain that over time. I mean, people want to be taken care of outside the hospital, and we have the best software systems to do that. So, there\u2019ll be secular trends moving people from the hospital to hospice, home health, skilled nursing facilities, life plan communities and so on, and ResMed will beat to improve on all of them.  So, we\u2019re going to go across each of those portfolios and then lots of different factors over the next five years that will drive it. But we\u2019re very confident, we\u2019ll get double-digit volume growth across that portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning. So just on SG&A, you continue to lower that SG&A to sales ratio. Just wondering, like where do you see that going, how long can you continue to actually continue to lower it, and where exactly are the gains coming from? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Gretel. I\u2018ll handle to Rob Douglas, our COO. Rob Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Gretel. The really good thing in our volume growth business -- we were talking earlier about the volume growth, is sort of engineering leverage into the systems and process is not that hard to do, if you really focus and keep going. Obviously, our sales processes and all of our sort of systems and the way we work do need continued investment. And we can\u2019t promise we\u2019ll be getting leverage forever. But while the volume growth is strong, we\u2019ll continue to be efficient and drive that. Obviously, you did see in our organic business, we got very good leverage. And as we\u2019ve brought in the new businesses that maybe haven\u2019t had some of that sort of leverage thinking applied to them, that sort of added on quite a bit. But they have remained then huge opportunities to build leverage with some of the thinking around the process management and the continuous improvement programs that we\u2019ve got. So we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve still got plenty of headroom to keep driving that leverage. Operator : Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie. Your line is open. David Bailey : Mick, just one for me. Just wondering if you could perhaps give us a sense as to the contribution of non-invasive ventilators to devices revenue for the group? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, David. We don\u2019t split it out to a granular level of detail. What I can say is, in general, if you look at sort of the growth of respiratory care in ventilation versus a sleep apnea care and the device growth, it\u2019s a little lower in respiratory care as a sort of a secular growth rate. And so, again, we don\u2019t just accept that and say well that means our non-invasive ventilators will grow slower than our sleep ap devices. But, it is something that is generally there from the secular trend. We actually -- this last quarter and before that, David, we had really strong growth in our ventilators. We made a software upgrade. And this wasn\u2019t a cloud offer, this was actually embedded software that is within the Astral ventilator that was really well-received by customers in Europe and in the U.S. And so, we saw some pretty strong market share gains that drove good growth in devices in both Europe and in the U.S. from our ventilator side of the business. But, we don\u2019t split it out yet. I look forward to when Propeller is so successful driving the digital health side that we have to break out our respiratory care division the way that we do our SaaS division and at that point I\u2019ll be able to give you a whole lot of the color into the ventilation part of the business. But I can say, it grew well this quarter. And we think that software upgrade has more legs on it and has some more growth ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jeffries. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : So, maybe just a question on -- I\u2019ll just keep it to one, on France and Japan. You mentioned that connected devices is there, the upgrades seem to be completed. So, is there an expectation France, Japan to sort of normalize after those upgrades are completed? And if so, what extent do you think the benefit can be as a tailwind as those two countries normalize on the device side? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Anthony. That allows me to talk about that digital health upgrade in France and Japan, which was incredible to see the rate at which two countries move into digital health. As you said, we will start to normalize as we pass all the comparables of that ahead of market growth that we\u2019ve had in our rearview mirror. Look, what I\u2019d say is that by the end -- before the end of this fiscal year, we will normalize France and Japan, and really that will influence across that whole portfolio of Europe, Asia and the rest of the world that we report on. We\u2019ll start to see that whole group normalize to market growth. And then, hopefully, as we launch more of these digital health solutions into countries beyond France and Japan, that we\u2019ll be talking about the s-curve of innovation of digital health in Finland and in Switzerland and in Germany. I don\u2019t have announcements on any other countries beyond those two. But, I look forward sort of working through the intricacies of the other 120 countries we do business in as they embrace digital health, the same way France and Japan did. But the short answer to your question is, by the end of this fiscal year, before the end of this fiscal year, we would expect that out of U.S. device growth to normalize. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs. Chris Cooper : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the expansion of Brightree into other areas outside OSA. Can I just ask the rationale for the three areas you\u2019ve chosen? And also, could you just confirm, this is something you\u2019re going to continue to roll out across the other areas of healthcare? And if so, over what timeframe, please? Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. Brightree has an incredible cloud-based enterprise resource planning and systems planning capability for home medical equipment companies. And they've actually always been able to, from our acquisition of them over three years ago to today, serviced beyond just sleep apnea and COPD. We've been servicing patients with incontinence, diabetic and enteral at different levels. What we really decided to do was to bring our resupply capabilities that we first applied to the ResMed side of the business, which was masks, over to those other areas of business. And so, it's not really expanding Brightree\u2019s footprint in terms of which customers it goes after. It's more expanding the services that we offer. Now, with the infusion, the growth of infusion business, that does bring some players in HME who have that -- infusion part of their business brings that into play for Brightree. But I consider it more of an adjacency. If you think about it, the core growth of Brightree is in home medical equipment provider. And everything they do can be digitized and can be put on the cloud, and that's Brightree\u2019s goal, and it was before we acquired them and it has been after we acquired them. And I'm just happy to see that we didn't just focus on sleep apnea and COPD growth for HME providers. We are actually thinking holistically about their business. And these new launches will allow Brightree to grow its very profitable part of the business, but also to serve those customers better and to bring more efficiencies to them which will help for the health of that distribution of home medical equipment in the U.S. and really help our partners grow, and it\u2019s good profitable revenue from ResMed as well. So, I\u2019d say, it is a very strong, good adjacency and a good part of our ongoing growth. Chris Cooper : And this is a strategy you\u2019re going to continue to look to push going forward? Mick Farrell : Yes, absolutely, Chris. We\u2019ll look to continue to find opportunities for home medical equipment providers to get efficiencies. So, if this part of the business that are analog, that are fax based, I mean, you wouldn\u2019t believe some of the opportunities for innovation are actually quite relatively simple and we have solutions. For instance, our e-fax [ph] solution to just digitize that whole space and help doctors and home care provides more easily integrate with each other, stuff that just is on the pipeline that we really have to get the solutions out there and get customers adopting those new modules. But, as I said earlier, I think we are seeing some good adoption in modules, and we have a good path to continue that. Operator : Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO. Please go ahead. Matt Henriksson : Yes. Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. My question is with regards to the partnership or the agreement with Walgreens. Could you provide a little more detail into how many patients now you\u2019re opened up to using Propeller? And then how important are these pharmacy partnerships going forward for the overall Propeller strategy? Mick Farrell : So, thanks for the question, Matt. As I said in the prep remarks, the partnership with Propeller and Walgreens is a pilot trial, like all of our Propeller trials are in that pilot trial stage. It\u2019s exciting because it\u2019s a new place at the pharmacy for Propeller to acquire new customers into the digital health platform that we have for COPD and for asthma. So, it\u2019s not public how many pharmacies and how many patients are on that platform. But generally, with Propeller\u2019s data, when we get to the end of a pilot, we\u2019re able to publish those data to get them into the peer-reviewed press. And at that point, I\u2019ll be able to talk very liberally about those data, but I don\u2019t want to jeopardize the production or publication of those data. But, what I can say is if you look at the data that we had with other partnerships with the Cleveland Clinic data that we did talk specifically too, a 35% reduction in the number of clinic visits or a double-digit reduction in the visits to emergency room visits, these are, depending on the size of the business, if you\u2019re a large hospital system or a large payer, these are tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars that can saved across the scalable business. And so, it\u2019s early days of pilot data. I don\u2019t want to talk too much about the numbers until we really do start to scale it. But, I think it\u2019s important to note what -- where we want to go with digital health and COPD. And the Walgreens experiment I thought was worth sharing because it\u2019s a new sort of place to find these patients that goes beyond sort of the traditional doctor. We\u2019re now talking a pharmacy clinic. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. Please go ahead. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much for taking my question. Just on competitive bidding, obviously the bids are now open for \u201821. I\u2019m just trying to understand if you\u2019re saying to think about that and how you might pass yourself or what sort of thought process you might have going into that? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for your question, Andrew. We have a very sophisticated market access team looking and governance -- is looking at this. Dave, do you want to give a summary where we\u2019re with CB? David Pendarvis : Sure. So, even though the bid windows open, it\u2019s going to be open for 90 days. And so, the main thing that our team is doing now is continuing to work along with others in the industry to educate the industry to make sure they understand new rules of bidding and how to understand, how to think about it, how to model the impact of lead item pricing on your overall portfolio of products and to make sure that our customers are in the best position they can be in to be able to go forward and bid appropriately. So, that\u2019s really the first, second and third priorities today and that will continue. We\u2019ve seen an uptick in the number of people who have visited the website, the number of people who are attending seminars as we\u2019ve gotten into the bid window opening period. So, that\u2019s the main thing that we\u2019re doing. Beyond that, we\u2019re obviously trying to make sure that our customers who are the ones, who are putting the bids in a position to do best they can and make the best estimates they can for what they can do going forward. So, we\u2019re trying to support the overall process, but we\u2019re really secondary to it. So, we\u2019ve got to be in a support role, primarily. Operator : Your next question comes from David Low of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. David Low : Thanks very much. A bunch of questions for Brett on the restructuring charges. So, we\u2019ve seen restructuring come through for the second year in a row. Just wondering how you think about restructuring. Is this going to be something that we\u2019re likely to see on ongoing basis? And how do you distinguish between what\u2019s the restructuring charge and what falls into sort of regular SG&A and R&D costs? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean, with any business, I think from time to time, it\u2019s inevitably that you have some restructuring coming through. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s routine or it\u2019s necessarily going to happen all the time. I guess, we distinguish anything that\u2019s kind of logical program, it\u2019s really something that we\u2019re structurally challenging. So, the elements that we\u2019re looking at in respiratory care, we really have to look at on strategically the workforce planning and look at what capabilities we need, particularly as we move and focus more around the digital health. And you heard me talk about the Propeller and what we\u2019re doing there, and it\u2019s really making sure that we have those capabilities. So, in order to do that, really we need to look at workforce planning every now and then and strategically, if you like, make some calls, and we\u2019ve done that this quarter in respiratory care. The other elements for the German R&D facility, which is small legacy system that we basically selected to close that down. They did good work there but we -- it is kind of subscale, we\u2019ve got -- as you know, we\u2019ve got the major hubs, Sydney, Singapore in the U.S. So, we really thought we could do that more effectively at the larger hubs. That\u2019s something that\u2019s kind of more permanent in nature, if you like. And then, SaaS, the third element on the SaaS restructuring is really related to the integration activities, particularly around the home health and hospice segment, we\u2019re really strongly integrating that portfolio. So, again, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing in SaaS that I think will only happen time to time, we\u2019re really aligning strongly around HME and then around home health and hospice and then around MatrixCare with some segments such as the skilled nursing facilities. So, there again, it\u2019s really positioning that portfolio to operate technically as it can from a revenue growing perspective and also from clearly -- obviously from a cost related expected as well. So, I think, from time to time, it\u2019s inevitable, but I don\u2019t think -- it\u2019s not necessarily going be routing. We\u2019re not going to have these every quarter, for example. Operator : Your last question comes from Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sean Laaman : Good morning, Mick. Mick, I\u2019m wondering if could tease out a comment on the rate of Brightree users buying other Brightree users during the quarter, and was that an issue? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Sean. Looking at U.S. home medical equipment channel, there\u2019s many thousands of providers, and Brightree has a very strong double-digit share of those many thousands of providers, and there has been over time and will continue to be M&A. And so, yes, during the quarter, there was M&A I\u2019m sure. I can\u2019t think of a particular example in my head but I'm sure there were examples of Brightree -- accounts who\u2019ve used Brightree service acquiring other accounts who use Brightree. As you know, we generally charge that business on a per user per time period methodology. And so in general, if there two accounts come together, it could be neutral to revenue. Now, there can be some efficiencies, or it could have been one of those businesses using more modules or less modules. And so there could be many factors that either increase or decrease the revenue from the account during that process. But, it\u2019s something that\u2019s there, it\u2019s part of the business. I'd say less of an impact on things like churn, where you just have people -- new people coming in and people switching to other solutions or turning off some of automated solutions. But, it\u2019s part of that business and we've managed that over the history, three plus years we\u2019ve managed Brightree and the entity and the team there managed it for their last 10 years that they\u2019ve been in business as well. So, it\u2019s part of the equation but it\u2019s not something that's new and it\u2019s not something that we're unable to manage. And I think you saw during the quarter strong single digit growth that we were able to do well and we thing we can even do better from there. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Rob. And before we close the call, I want to thank our dedicated 7,500 strong team here at ResMed for their continued dedication, focus and commitment to our growth strategy and all the operating excellence initiatives. You folks are the core of what we do and your efforts have enabled us to deliver these great results that we just shared with our shareholders. We\u2019re focused as a team on our future pipeline and all the products and software solutions we have to improve outcomes and benefits for all of our stakeholders, that includes patients, includes physicians, payers, providers, governments and of course our shareholders.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results for ResMed\u2019s first quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter and a few key milestones. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financials in further detail. We have started fiscal year 2020 right where we left off with 2019. Our team achieved another quarter of balanced growth across the portfolio, driven by continued strong performance in the mask category. We are taking share with recent new product introductions and our solutions are enabling increased therapy adherence as well as expansion of resupply programs to those who need it. Our dedicated team of more than 7,500 ResMedians around the world, have again delivered strong results. As the world's leading software-driven medical device company, we continue to use technology to advance our leadership position. We have sold more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market. And our AirView, cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 11 million patient accounts. In the last 12 months, we changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a complete mask system, to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare branded out of hospital software systems are helping to manage 93 million more people. So during the last 12 months we improved more than 108 million lives with ResMed products, services and software solutions. We are well on our way to the ambitious goal to improve 250 million lives in 2025. Our connected solutions are providing us with valuable access to de-identified therapy data that we are using to derive actionable insights to benefit patients, physicians and providers, as well as to inform future innovation in products and software. These datasets are growing exponentially and we now have 5 billion knots of medical sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. We remained laser focused on growth in our core market of sleep apnea, as well as in our adjacent respiratory medical markets of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as asthma. Our expanded focus to now grow outside the hospital software solutions allows us to help customers create efficiencies to take costs out of the healthcare system and to improve the quality of care across home medical equipment, home health, hospice, skilled nursing facilities, life plan communities and beyond. We believe the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today. That's where we are winning today and that's where we will continue to win in the future as we provide market-leading value to customers. Let's now briefly review our top level financial results for the quarter. We achieved another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 17% in constant currency across the portfolio. This growth was well balanced across domestic U.S. and global products sales, as well as balanced across our Software-as-a-Service businesses. We continued to deliver operating leverage in the quarter leading to a non-GAAP operating profit growth of 22% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93. Turning to a brief discussion of our sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category, we delivered a good quarter. We achieved year-over-year constant currency device growth of 6% globally, supported by very strong 8% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies. We achieved 4% constant currency growth of devices in combined Europe, Asia and rest of world. We achieved excellent device growth in the UK, Switzerland and across our Nordics countries. As discussed over the last few quarters, we experienced a continued headwind during the quarter for device growth in France as a result of digital health-related fleet upgrades. We expect that headwind to ease by the end of this fiscal year and then return to market device growth in France. It is great to see a steady flow of our digital health solutions into different European countries and to see positive constant currency device growth across the continent this quarter. The growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 19% in constant currency globally. This is well ahead of market growth rates, indicating we gained significant market share during the quarter. The reason that we continued to take share around the world is that we make the smallest, the quietest and the most comfortable masks available in the market. Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continue their growth across global markets. The success of these flagship masks was augmented during the quarter by good uptake of our recent mask launches. To recap those launches, we have now launched four new masks during the last 12 months; the F30, the N30i and the P30i. And just this week, actually on Monday, our newest innovation was launched, the N30. We have the right mask for every patient, every time, and the N30 adds innovative dimensions to these portfolios. The N30 is a world first tube-down nasal cradle CPAP mask in a new product subcategory that we are calling the minimalist category. The N30 is our smallest, our lightest mask ever and our quietest nasal mask ever. I personally think this new N30 is another winner from our amazing research and development engineers. Watch this space as it gets into the hands of our market-leading marketing and sales teams. Now mask portfolio overall is positioned to offer world-leading options for physicians to prescribe for home care providers to fit in a first-time set-up, and most especially for the needs of the ultimate customer, the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet all underserved customer needs. The bottom line is that our new masks have a lot of runway ahead. Unfortunately, they don't let me talk about ResMed\u2019s future product pipeline, so I won\u2019t. Our success comes as healthcare providers, physicians and patients around the world continue to vote with their wallets and choose ResMed products, not just for the innovative design and high quality of our devices and masks, but also for the sustainable value proposition of the digital health solutions that we offer. Our digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones through apps like myAir and apps like Propeller, are all leading to significant improvements in lowering cost, and improving health outcomes and improving quality of life for patients around the world. Through digital health technology, we are driving patient engagement so that people can enjoy the benefits of the best therapy available. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, healthcare providers, payers and governments. There's still a long way to go. Our research that was just published by the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal in July shows that there are over 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, while only around 20 million or so are being treated today. We keep forging ahead, investing in our own research and development to drive further innovation and advancement, as well as by working with partners. On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is working on software solutions to help identify and engage and better manage more people with sleep apnea. It is very early days on \u2013 in this JV, but our philosophy is that the more person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their own personal healthcare outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. Over time, we know this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business, while allowing ResMed to participate in a broader chronic disease management ecosystem, covering not just sleep apnea, but also cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD and beyond. These chronic disease management platforms will include clinical care as well as wellness improvements in nutrition, in cardiovascular exercise and in mental health. Let's now turn to our second vector of growth here at ResMed, our business in respiratory care. There were nearly 400 million people worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. We don't believe they are well served by healthcare systems today. We see the opportunity to better manage COPD through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions that can help patients as they progress with this chronic disease, including how patients are communicated to, how patients are encouraged in their medical care and how patients are looked after as individual persons. We're advancing our respiratory care strategy in multiple ways. Earlier this summer we introduced a number of enhancements to AirView, our cloud-based patient management platform. We are making management of ventilation patients much simpler and much more useful for home medical equipment providers. Physicians and HMEs can now look deep into therapy data to see key performance indicators such as pulse rate, inspiratory time, maximum airflow, and even a patient\u2019s rapid shallow breathing index or RSBI. All these data are now available within our digital healthcare ecosystem, with the easy to use AirView platform. Our goal is to help create a frictionless experience when managing COPD patients with ResMed's solutions. Our team at Propeller also continues to grow their business as we move from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with leading respiratory pharmaceutical companies. The team was recently at the European Respiratory Society Annual Congress in Madrid. It was great to see Propeller represented at multiple pharma booths, including live demonstrations of Propeller solutions for physicians. Propeller was also featured in several scientific presentations during ERS, including the public announcement of a new large COPD outcomes trial that's sponsored by Novartis. The trial will compare Propeller plus COPD standard of care to COPD standard of care alone. The trial has already begun enrolling patients during this quarter. As we outlined, when we acquired Propeller in January, the digital health opportunity with respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build into critical mass. This quarter, we passed a significant milestone with more than 100,000 people enrolled into the Propeller ecosystem. Let's be clear, we are still in the early days of market development here. The analogy is that we are now just lacing our shoes for the digital health ultra marathon in both COPD and in asthma. So there's lots of terrain ahead. The evolution that we have made in our respiratory care business has set ResMed up to become the global leader in digital health for COPD. From Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD with Propeller's pharmaceutical adherence solutions to Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD with portable oxygen concentrators as well as our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilation solutions. Let's now turn to our third vector of growth, our Software-as-a-Service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the SaaS portfolio for long-term growth. Our competitive advantage derives from our leadership position in SaaS solutions for home medical equipment, for skilled nursing facilities, for home, health, hospice, life plan communities and home care services. ResMed is the best strategic player competing in these verticals. And we have the expertise running global digital health systems at scale to be able to succeed in the future. Our SaaS portfolio continues its growth trajectory this quarter with revenue up 83% year-on-year during the quarter. Clearly, growth in this first quarter was accelerated leveraging our MatrixCare acquisition in November of 2018. We will lap that acquisition during this current second quarter. We estimate that the underlying market growth of the blended portfolio of seven out-of-hospital SaaS verticals that we serve is in the high single digits. Leaving out the MatrixCare acquisition, we grew right in line with the market in Q1. We have set up an execution plan to continue to innovate and to continue to launch market-leading upgrades combined with new capabilities that will allow us to gain market share in our SaaS verticals and participate in the fastest growing ones so that we can beat market growth. We plan to exit fiscal 2020 with solid double digit growth in our SaaS business segment. One example of the progress that we're making in our SaaS portfolio is the recent announcement of our collaboration with Cerner as a new preferred provider for home health and hospice software. This agreement validates ResMed as an industry-leading provider of digital health solutions for out-of-hospital healthcare. Our Matrixcare managed offering for home health and hospice customers includes the best-of-breed capabilities from both the MatrixCare technology and from the Brightree technology. This agreement ensures our home health and hospice solution is available to all of Cerner's large customer base. The net result is growth opportunities for both Cerner and MatrixCare sales teams. In fact at the recent Cerner Health Care Conference, a major healthcare system with a very large home health business was introduced to the ResMed solution and they are quickly moving toward a contract with our MatrixCare team. It is clearly early days as the ink dries on the Cerner contract, but the bottom line is, we are excited to drive growth from this partnership and to leverage interoperability to provide value for all of our customers. In summary, for the SaaS business, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare. We are helping people stay out of the hospital and in the care setting of their choice with lower costs and a higher quality of life for the person. The best place that people often choose is almost always their own home. Ageing in place is a trend that is growing not just in the U.S. but globally and we plan to enable and leverage that positive change. We think that's an important part of the future of healthcare. Before I turn the call over to Brett, Let me close with this. We have had a great start to the new fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow throughout fiscal year 2020 and beyond. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving both top-line and bottom-line growth as well as executing on our strategy to improve 250 million lives in healthcare that's delivered outside the hospital in 2025. We are focused on our triple aim to slow chronic disease progression, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and to improve outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer, the person who simply to sleep well, to breathe well and to live a better life well away from that hospital. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you in Sydney. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $691 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $317 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $224 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $193 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets device sales were $152 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms, a 4% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was $72 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 19% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6% while masks and other sales increased by 19% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the first quarter was $87 million, an increase of 83% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 59.5% compared to 58.3% in the same quarter last year and 59.3% in Q4 FY19. Compared to the prior year, our gross margin increased by 120 basis points. This was predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, the MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $167 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 16%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.6% compared to 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the remaining three quarters of fiscal year 2020. R&D expenses for the quarter were $48 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 27%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $18.5 million for the quarter, an increase of 44% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $13.3 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $191 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $135 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.93, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.83. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.6. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2020 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $162 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $22.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $38 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $56.1 million. We recorded equity losses of $6.8 million in our income statement in the September quarter as I said via Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity loss of each quarter in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. During the quarter, we repaid $49 million of our outstanding debt. At September 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with modest debt levels. Finally, to recap, our top-line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we're continuing to drive operating leverage with Q1 non-GAAP operating profit up 22% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks. Brett. We will now going to turn the call over to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, please do feel free to return to the call queue. Chris, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning. So just on the U.S. device growth continues to be very strong, just wondering what would be the growth in kind of new patient setups in the quarter, give us some detail on that? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel. So we don't actually have full visibility even to the number. We sell to in the U.S. to home medical equipment companies that then sell to patients that are renewing in their five-year renewal or to new patient. So we don't have full visibility into that. But it is interesting with a reasonably sized patient pool in the United States it would be a good double-digit percentage or so of those that will be replenishment devices. But the 8% growth I think is really ahead of market. We think the market growth is in the sort of mid-single digits. And so to be at 8% growth in the U.S. shows that we were taking some share due to the value of Air Solutions, AirView and myAir and all the sort of digital health solutions that are there. Gretel Janu : Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Gretel. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans. Your line is open. Steve Wheen : Yes. Hi guys. Just a question also on the devices, there seems to be certainly amongst the DME land a bit of a rush on COPD codes and the setting up of patients with ventilators. Just wondering if you're seeing any benefit from that, particularly around amongst your Astral \u2013 your ventilator range in particular, the Astral? Mick Farrell : Steve, thanks for the question. We actually saw really solid growth in the core fleet business, as a sizeable chunk of that 8% growth in the U.S. Astral tends to be more of a player, ventilation in general tends to be more of a player in Europe and so some of that sort of 4% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and rest of world will have been driven by the Astral in some sort of much smaller element of the 8% U.S. growth. But one thing that we've been really strong with our DME customers is to make sure that the right device goes on the right patient at the right time. And when you look at COPD, there were lots of solutions from our [indiscernible] as well as \u2013 so non-invasive ventilation, as well as even Stellar product in non-invasive ventilation all the way through to our Astral product, which is really a life support ventilator and should be used in very severe COPD and in life support needs. And so, yes, it really wasn't a huge contributor in the U.S. this quarter, probably slightly more significant in Europe. But it's really good solid balanced growth, if you like, from our sleep apnea side with some additions from respiratory care is how I'd position it. Steve Wheen : Great. Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon. And good afternoon to most people, good morning for others. But thanks for taking the question. Just kind of big picture, I know some people are going to focus on the device sleep apnea growth, but I know you guys ended up delivering 11% top line growth, excluding acquisitions and that's above market in almost every category and even as you're seeing a headwind in France. So I guess looking out whether it's this year or the next couple of years, what prohibits you guys from continuing that double-digit top line growth rate and what could drive it higher or lower from today's levels? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Margaret. Certainly, we did have a very good quarter here in Q1. And as you said, we grew like sort of 11% constant currency globally in our sleep and respiratory care combined businesses. If you think about the global growth and we have enough data now to know that the growth really is in that mid- to high-single digits, so the devices growing in the mid-single digits and masks growing in the high-single digits. Clearly, we did take share in Q1 and a lot of that is driven by the digital health technology on the flow generator side to have some of the share taking on the device side, and then the new product introductions that I detailed in the prepared remarks, four new masks in addition to two strong flagship marks there, so NPI has been an incredible contributor to us. Just if you think through the year ahead, even during this quarter that we're currently in the second quarter, we're going to lap one of those four product launches on the mask side and we'll continue to lap those during the quarter. So look, I'm always very excited about our innovations; the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected, and I think that innovation drives. But you can't outgrow market forever, right? You've got to then focus on getting more patients into the funnel, which is our whole identify, engage and enroll people in. So I think a fantastic Q1, but as we look through the fiscal year, we think we can meet or beat market growth, but you're not going to beat it every single time. Margaret Kaczor : Great. Thank you, guys. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Margaret. Operator : Your next question is from David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open. David Low : Thanks very much. During the period, we heard \u2013 we saw from your competitor Philips that they had issues with their connected care business. They talked about tariffs, et cetera. Just wondering sort of market landscape in the U.S., whether you saw any disruption from that? Do you think some of the \u2013 that ResMed may have been a beneficiary of the issues that they were working through? Mick Farrell : Yes, I'll hand that \u2013 good questions, David. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO. Rob Douglas : Sure, David. Just generally on the tariffs issue just to reiterate, as we've said before, the way our whole supply chain is configured, we're not really affected by the specific tariffs. We export very little into China from the U.S. and very little from China to the U.S. Our supply chain is more Southeast Asian focused. And we've got a great team in China doing local products for China. So that's pretty solid. Our AirView solutions on the other hand, mostly by the way developed by teams all around the world, but really a strong product offering, continues to deliver superior value to our customers. And we think \u2013 with day-in and day-out we'll fight competitions with those products and belief that we've got a better proposition to offer. So we \u2013 from our perspective, we didn't see any particular competitive issues that were sort of changing the normal competitive dynamics. We do have to sell and execute well. And our teams have been doing that. David Low : Great. All right. Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much, guys. Perhaps just thinking forward into competitive bidding and I guess the bids are in, so I guess by the next time we\u2019ve got a sense where the clearing price land. I'm just wondering whether there\u2019s any preliminary comments you've got and your thoughts there or any preliminary actions you're taking I guess to prepare for competitive bidding, and whether that involves new product launches or anything? Just say preliminary is your sort of doing or preparatory actions? Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll hand that to David Pendarvis. David Pendarvis : Thanks, Andrew. The \u2013 obviously we spent a lot of time along with others in the industry trying to educate the market participants so they would be able to bid effectively and bid smartly given the new rules. We remained encouraged with the changes that were put in place principally that clearing price is what's going to drive reimbursement as opposed to the median price under the old regime, and some of the other changes that were made, including requiring bonds to bid in particular areas. We hoping that together with the education that the industry did will lead to smart bids and that'll lead to a fair, more realistic reimbursement. We obviously didn't participate in the bidding process and haven't had direct conversations with customers about what they bid. So it's all conjecture at this point as to where the ultimate reimbursement will land. But no matter where it is, whether it's a private pay, reimbursement change or a Medicare U.S. change or something elsewhere in the world, we're continually working with our customers to help them be more efficient, help them take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves and to enable them to better serve patients under whatever the reimbursement schemes are. So we'll definitely continue to do that, and watch where the U.S. Medicare landscape evolves. But at the moment, that's still a year and a bit away. So we'll just keep doing what we're doing and obviously focus on it when the time comes. Andrew Goodsall : Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question is from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. Solid mask growth outside of outside of America, and I just wanted to understand you've had one of your competitors launch a new full face mask outside of America. Have you seen any difference in your full face mask sales outside of the U.S. versus within the U.S.? And how are you positioning yourself now that they've got FDA approval to launch within the U.S.? Mick Farrell : Yes. So thanks for the question, Lyanne. And look, we have multiple competitors in the 120 countries we sell into and we expect new product introduction from our competitors on a regular basis. Yes, as you noted, during the quarter, we had 19% constant currency growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America. We also had 19% constant currency growth of masks in Europe, Asia and rest of world, where some of those masks and new launches have already been in play during the quarter. So I think we've \u2013 I know we've got the most robust sleep apnea mask portfolio on the planet versus our competitors in all the 120 countries that we participate in. But there's no arrogance or hubris heated out. Our team of R&D engineers furiously working, not only on technology to address underserved needs, but to think differently about how to really achieve that ultimate goal, which is sort of the silent CPAP and the invisible mask. And if you look at the N30 that we just launched, this minimalist category mask, it's about as close to an invisible mask as you can get. It is small, it is quiet, it is comfortable. So, look, I love innovation coming to the market from our competitors and from us because it keeps us all honest. But during the quarter, we performed very well versus all the NPI from our competitors with our own NPI. And I expect us to be able to do that into the future. And competition is just a healthy part of making sure that tens of millions of people get the breathing night. Lyanne Harrison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell with Citi. Your line is open. John Deakin-Bell: Well, good morning. I have a question for Brett. Just to deconstruct that gross margin expansion a little bit. I think previously you've given us the fee of what was from the MatrixCare. But can you just maybe elaborate a bit more in terms of strong mask growth, higher margin that would have impacted, and also whether there's a more benign processing environment in the U.S. which is helping as well? Brett Sandercock : Hi, John, it\u2019s Brett. I think it's all of those things, probably the pricing environment is relatively been on at the moment, so the impacts there were pretty modest. In terms of acquisitions that contributed around 50 basis points. So if you think about that, still really a strong, let's call it organic expansion of the margin, which is really good. That's really around the manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. And then clearly some product mix benefit there as you saw the outperformance in the mask growth. So a combination of all of those factors I think led to that expansion. John Deakin-Bell: Okay. Thanks, Brett. Operator : And your next question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Your line is open. David Bailey : Good morning, guys. Just in relation to U.S. mask and accessories, you've talked to adherence to resuppliers as key drivers of growth. Just wondering if you can comment on your views as to those factors being drivers of growth over the next two to three years? Mick Farrell : Yes, it's a good question, David. I'll hand that to Rob. Rob Douglas : Yes, thanks, David. Yes. The resupply program has definitely supported the mask portfolio. We've talked many times. You've got to understand the sort of the feedback of this. If we can get patients onto a good mask, they're more likely to stay on treatment, they'll do better and then they'll need a mask. And so we continue to see that dynamic happening. Our software solutions that support the resupply programs and enable our HME customers to manage resupply programs more efficiently and ensure that the patients have the treatment that they need when they need it. We\u2019re also supporting it. These are long-term programs. We've been running resupply programs for many years now and our teams will continue to refine and focus it. And as Mick said earlier though, these markets are competitive. We do have competitors playing it. We have competition in resupply programs as well as in mask. And it really gets down to, we've got a really strong team executing broadly across all parts of the portfolio on this that will continue to make sure that we're providing the best solutions for patients and providers delivering the best outcomes. So I think it's really a steady as she goes progress. We love \u2013 we really like these resupply programs and they're providing us a very solid steady business. David Bailey : Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks, David. Operator : Next question is from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sean Laaman : Good morning, everybody. Mick, I'm wondering if you can give a little bit more granularity on the Novartis study you mentioned in your preliminary comments and perhaps some timelines that would be really useful. Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. I wasn't at ERS, but I'll hand over to David Pendarvis, who can give us some more detail on the Novartis clinical trial. David Pendarvis : Terrific. Sean, we mentioned in the opening remarks, it goes by the name of magnify, and of course with trials these days you have to have a good acronym, and that stands for maximizing adherence and gaining new information for your COPD. And the trial is going to be obviously sponsored by Novartis. And what it's doing is taking patients within clinics and then within those clinics, randomizing the patients to either standard clinical practice or using Propeller. And then there'll be a comparison. And the endpoint is the time to failure of treatment. And then failure of treatment is defined in various ways such as needing an additional medication, having some particularly acute exacerbations, winding up in hospital, those kinds of things. And it'll look and see, whether or not adding the adherence benefits of Propeller linked since the time that patients stay in that good controlled state. It's beginning recruiting now and I believe it's supposed to run through the end of 2021. So it will take quite a while before it meets it\u2019s \u2013 the end of that time period. But the important thing is a lot of the data that's been out now has been done in the asthma setting. Obviously, that's an important area and we want to take care of those patients. But the COPD strategy is very important to us because of the way it connects with our overall respiratory care strategy. So having someone like Novartis sponsor a study, looking at Propeller benefits to a COPD patient population, we think is a real important milestone and we'll look for good benefits to come out of that study in the future, but it will be a few years. Sean Laaman : Fantastic. Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Sean. Operator : Your next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Great. I'm just going to have a follow-up to the Novartis question and somewhat Mick, you mentioned a couple of weeks ago indications of interest from AstraZeneca, Glaxo and Novartis on Propeller health. I'm just wondering if you have an update there and anything you can share potentially on how that would be priced on a per user per month basis. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes Thanks for the question, Anthony. Pharma companies \u2013 there are many respiratory pharmaceutical, pharma players in the field and the names you mentioned all have drugs in the market. One thing about pharma companies is they\u2019re very competitive with each other and they don\u2019t want information shared too much publicly. Certainly on our Investor deck we put the names of those where we have published clinical data and we are working with. And the reason we\u2019re bringing Novartis in our prep remarks here is that\u2019s a public clinical trial. One of the interesting things that\u2019s happening here is there\u2019s a lot of trials that aren\u2019t public that are happening out there that obviously we cannot talk about. As we look forward, the important thing if you think about milestones, Anthony, to sort of to look at on this, sort of digital health option play if you like that we have in our strategy with the Propeller solution is when somebody goes from these pilot trials to a commercial trial and when they would allow us to talk about that publicly. And so, if and when that happens, that\u2019s the milestone, I think that\u2019s most important in a material element to our shareholders. As I said in the prep remarks, we got in early with Propeller and this is a long road. I think I used the analogy that it\u2019s an ultra marathon. This is beyond just 26.2 mile. This is a huge journey. COPD number two cause for hospitalization and rehospitalization, the number three cause of death. It has such good runway for us in the future, but there\u2019s nothing material in the quarter. And so, we\u2019re just giving the update. We hit 100,000 patients. We think that\u2019s fantastic. Right validation to have Novartis start its public study. It\u2019s going to take a couple of years as Dave said. But I would expect that before those couple of years we will have some other milestones of going to some commercial trials that we can talk about in upcoming conference calls. But at the moment this quarter, Anthony, there\u2019s nothing to report other than really good early data. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin with UBS. Your line is open. Saul Hadassin : Thanks. Good morning, Mick. Good morning or good afternoon, Mick and Brett. I want to talk about the SaaS business making the tie-up with Cerner, I mean it suggests that they\u2019re effectively leaving that post-acute space to providers like yourself. I\u2019m just interested to know the \u2013 how much work needs to be done to allow for the two architectures to talk to each other. If you have a new electronic medical record for example in the acute space offered by Cerner, what work has to be done in terms of your SaaS business to allow those two systems to talk to each other. When do you expect to see the ability of the benefits of that tie-up to come through? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Saul. It allows us to talk to the area of interoperability, which is incredibly important for us here at ResMed. We have 100 API calls per second from integrators into our air solutions ecosystem. So every second 100 interactions with another EHR, EMR whether it\u2019s an individual person or myAir app checking the therapy or a physician at Massachusetts pioneer looking over 20,000 patients to do some management by exception protocol. And so, the Cerner contract or deal is that they \u2013 Cerner are looking for ResMed and really truly through our MatrixCare managed team to take care of home health and hospice customers for them. So they have customers that have hospital systems, but for the out-of-hospital part where it goes to home health and hospice, they want ResMed to be their partner to take care of those. And we think it\u2019s a really exciting opportunity for the MatrixCare sales team and for the Cerner sales team to partner up and have that move forward. And it was really interesting at the Cerner conference to have our MatrixCare and Brightree teams there and all the technology available from the iPad app and all the capabilities that we have for home health and hospice and to get some really good leads. It\u2019s not going to be material in the next 90 days for us, this Cerner contract, but the reason we\u2019re talking about it is that idea of interoperability with Cerner, with Epic, with Allscripts, with all the players in hospital healthcare, we think it\u2019s going to be really important that ResMed is the best person that can provide that handshake that API from someone in acute care to what they call post-acute care, but what we call out-of-hospital healthcare and we think that partnership is going to be really strong. So we\u2019ll give you updates as the quarters progress, not just to the Cerner home health and hospice partnership, but to other partnerships with hospital systems, hospital providers and EHR providers. We think it\u2019s a good milestone to show that one of the top three leaders along with Epic and Allscripts there in hospital EHR has chosen ResMEd as their home health and hospice care provider with our MatrixCare managed solution and we\u2019re really excited about that. Saul Hadassin : Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Thomas Yeo with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Cooper : Hi, there. It\u2019s Chris Cooper on for Tom. And apologies if I missed it, but I didn\u2019t hear much commentary on Mobi portable oxygen concentrator this morning and in your prepared remarks. Could you just give us an update there, please? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. I\u2019ll hand that to Rob. Rob Douglas : Thanks, Mick. Yes, Thomas. We, as you recall, we launched Mobi very early this year and we\u2019ve sort of been in a really still in a learning mode. It\u2019s a great product. We\u2019re actually learning a lot about the performance of the product and we\u2019ve talked about and continue to validate the issue of the balance of the performance specifications and how the product works. And so, we\u2019re in good shape there. What we\u2019re also learning is that it is challenging through, particularly through the U.S. reimbursement model how to get the right patients on the right treatment and how to get that property funded and we have been trialing experiments in looking at ways to optimize and develop that. Really we\u2019re learning a lot about what our sort of future pathways to market would be and how to \u2013 how can we make it best suitable for our HME customers to support patients and also what are the future needs of products further down the track and feeding learnings into our future roadmap. So with that all going on, the learning process is quite successful. We\u2019re still not a major market share player with the product and that\u2019s unlikely to change into the short-term future with the Mobi product that we\u2019re currently investing and the way we\u2019re heading at the moment. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Mike Matson : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask about, there is a I guess a bill in Congress H.R. 2771 to kind of extend the relief from the bidding program that I think is set to expire into 2020. So just curious to get your thoughts on that and what that mean if that were not to be successful? Thanks. Mick Farrell : I\u2019ll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. David Pendarvis : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, there is a lot of efforts under way in the U.S. Congress right now to try to provide relief, particularly the one you mentioned which is try to extend the relief that was given that was that sort of 50-50 blend between prior reimbursement and the new system reimbursement into those rural areas. We certainly support that legislation. We think it\u2019s important that our customers who are operating particularly in extended areas where they\u2019ve got to drive many miles to patients\u2019 homes need to have reimbursement that reflects the operating cost that they\u2019ve got and we would certainly hope that the champions that there in Congress will carry the day. Now as your question implies, there is a lot going on in the U.S. Congress these days. It\u2019s very difficult to predict whether something like that will ultimately pass or whether CMS could respond on their own and provide that kind of relief. If it doesn\u2019t, I think as I said before when talking about competitive bidding, we\u2019ll obviously work with our customers to do what we can to support them. We think the remote capabilities of our devices are ideal for providing care to remote setting. You could do things like change some of the settings on a CPAP, you can certainly interrogate the CPAP for information about the quality of the therapy that has been provided, all without having to drive to someone\u2019s home. So we think that those systems helping customers whether they are in rural areas or not to deploy them is probably the best thing we can do to help in that kind of a setting. But we\u2019ll continue to support that legislation and other efforts with CMS to try to make sure that the Medicare policies and reimbursement is as favorable as it can be for the ultimate benefit of Medicare beneficiaries. Mike Matson : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Shane Storey with Wilson. Your line is open. Shane Storey : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s maybe a bit tangential, but it relates to the CMS reimbursement changes that hit skilled nursing providers this month. Sort of weighing up that as an incremental opportunity for Matrix, I mean do you have an estimate of the proportion of providers that are yet to adopt good solutions there? And just interested to know, just how much growth there is, a scope sort of toward available for Matrix there in the SaaS market? Mick Farrell : Yes, Shane. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good one. There are changes in reimbursement not just in HME as we just talked about, but also in skilled nursing facilities and within home health and hospice. These provide excellent opportunities for Software-as-a-Service providers to \u2013 if you\u2019re ahead of the game as MatrixCare was for the skilled nursing facilities changes as we are for the home health and hospice changes to be able to support customers through that change and even grow share because you\u2019ve got the best solution that deals with those changes well. One thing I can say is that the new CEO there at MatrixCare, Steve Pacicco has formed great relationships with the customers and he has a great sales team that know the skilled nursing facility teams really well. And we\u2019ve not only helped them through these changes in this quarter, but also set them up for success that our systems are operating well under the new reimbursement approach within those verticals. So that\u2019s \u2013 when you roll that all together, it\u2019s part of sort of that 2020 execution plan I talked about earlier that we see a good pop even if the blended rate of growth across these seven out-of-hospital healthcare verticals is in those high single digits. We think there are areas where we can get better growth than that. And we plan to exit 2020 with a double digit growth trajectory in the segment of SaaS. And part of that is going to be doing just what your question asked about, which is every part of the vertical, whether it\u2019s skilled nursing facilities, whether it\u2019s our new play in home health and hospice, the hunting license with Cerner in addition to our ability to grow share through having solutions that are ahead of the curve on reimbursement changes, they\u2019re all opportunities to be able to grow faster and form longer partnerships with our customers. Shane Storey : Thanks, Mick. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans. Your line is open. Steve Wheen : Hi, sorry. I just wanted to come back to Brett on the gross margin. You typically gave a bit of a range for that in terms of guidance. Are you able to do that again this quarter? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Sure, Steve. I mean there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but I would think it would be broadly consistent with where we were for Q1. Steve Wheen : Perfect. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And your next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Just a quick follow-ups on masks. I know you mentioned, Mick, a couple of launches. I\u2019m just wondering how much stocking potentially there was in the quarter? And then just on lead item. Is there any \u2013 Dave, you mentioned, we spoke a couple of days ago, but is there any indication on how this is kind of coming in post the notification period? Thanks again. Mick Farrell : Yes. So Anthony, I\u2019ll take the first part of your question on masks and Dave will take the second part. Clearly we had excellent new product introduction over the last 12 months, but your question was around do people do stocking orders. Our U.S. distribution, and frankly, our global distribution partners are getting very intelligent about inventory management, not just those who use Brightree and have ResMed\u2019s Brightree inventory management system, which will actually manage it for them, but many of them are getting really appropriate on that knowing when a new mask comes, watching how there r teasers setting it up and seeing the patient flow and making sure they don\u2019t get too ahead of the curve or behind the curve. You don\u2019t want a patient in the fitting room that wants the N30 and it\u2019s not there, but on the other hand, you don\u2019t want excess inventory because I have inventory carrying costs as everyone knows and our U.S. distributors are actually quite sophisticated on this. So I \u2013 obviously when some \u2013 you launch a brand new mask, people do need to make sure they got that mask on the shelf. But given the proportion of existing resupply patients, which is a very large portion, particularly the U.S. distributors patient flow, we don\u2019t think there was material impact from stocking. Now, we don\u2019t have full insight into our customers that aren\u2019t using Brightree or other inventory management solutions, but we think it\u2019s a pretty steady approach and we\u2019ve done new product introductions over the 20, 30 years we\u2019ve been in business. And I don\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen that a significant rate before and I don\u2019t think we saw any significant rate of that during the last quarter. Dave, the second part of the question for you. David Pendarvis : Sure. Yes, thanks Anthony. I mentioned a little bit earlier that ResMed along with other industry participants put a lot of energy and resources behind trying to educate the market participants who are going to be bidding about various factors including lead item pricing and we developed a calculator that was put out. There were some stats that were just discussed in the Medtrade meeting just earlier this week in Atlanta that there were over 17,000 downloads of that calculator. And that\u2019s just simply the one that was available to the participants here. CMS had their own calculator that folks downloaded. From the conversations that I\u2019ve had, my understanding is that most DMEs have a pretty good understanding of lead item pricing and how it works. And hopefully they\u2019ve avail themselves of the tools to be able to model out scenarios based on their own business and their own volume of products in different categories so that they can bid intelligently and in a way that\u2019s going to ultimately derive a fair and reasonable reimbursement. So I\u2019m confident that we got that message out that it was received. Obviously, we don\u2019t know how people bid and we\u2019ll work with customers as best we can to try to implement things when the day comes. But we are confident that we did what we could to try to educate. Anthony Petrone : Thanks again. Operator : We are now at the one hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Chris. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call this quarter. I\u2019d also like to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in a 120 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. We will talk again with all of our shareholders in approximately 90 days. Talk to you all then. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations or to me directly. As previously mentioned, all documents including the transcript and a replay of today\u2019s call will be available on our website later today. Chris, you may now close the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great, thank you, Christine. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Great, thanks Amy, and I'll go a little fast on my prepared remarks so we still have time for Q&A, despite the phone difficulties. Thanks, Amy. And thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financials in further detail. Our team achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth across the portfolio driven by superb performance in the mask category, particularly in the US market with good performance across the 140 countries where we provide our solutions. We continue to take market share with our software solutions that enable increased therapy adherence with resupply programs providing support to those who need it and with our innovative new products. Customers are voting with their wallets and they are voting for ResMed. As the world's leading software driven medical device company, we are using digital health technology to transform the industry. We have sold nearly 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market, and Air Solutions our cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 12 million patients. In the last 12 months, we have changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or complete ResMed mask system to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems are helping to manage 90 million more people outside the hospital. Digital health technology is an integrator across everything that ResMed does. AirView, myAir, Propeller, and a portfolio of other digital health solutions allow us to better engage with our customers and partners, including patients, physicians, providers, payers, and complete healthcare systems. We are investing in advanced analytics and expanding our capabilities in machine learning and machine intelligence so that we can grow this digital health ecosystem at double digits on a volume basis. We will grow from just over 100 million lives improved with our healthcare products and solutions as we ended 2019 to our ambitious forward looking goal of improving 250 million lives in 2025. We now have over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud, and we are analyzing these data to derive actionable insights for the benefit of patients, physicians, providers, and healthcare systems. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD, as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money, and to help achieve better management of chronic disease. We believe that the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today and that's where we are winning today. We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to drive financial success as we provide market-leading value to customers. Let's now briefly review our top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of double digit revenue growth. We're up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio. This growth continues to be well balanced across our domestic US, as well as our global product sales, as well as from our software-as-a-service business. We continue to deliver operating leverage with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21. I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the device\u2019s category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally supported by strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies as well as by improving Europe, Asia, and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device category. We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health related fleet upgrades. We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European summer, and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021. Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe, and we continue to benefit from strong market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea. Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations. Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise in the mid-teens. Our flagship masks the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continued their growth across global markets. The success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent mask launches. We have launched a steady rhythm of mass innovation over the past 15 months. We have just lapped the successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter, and we will lap the launch of the N30, the N30i, and the P30i during the coming 12 months. The F30i was launched just over a week ago combining the needs for patients in the Freedom and the Minimalist mask segments.  With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient, every time. We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians and home care providers, and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, and that's the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable, and more customized to each person's needs. Through digital health technologies, such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement without therapy, so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep. We have well over 2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching algorithms. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, providers, payers, and healthcare systems. Our Digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones are all leading to significant improvements in cost, improvements in healthcare outcomes and improvements in quality of life. We believe cloud based software combined with world leading medical devices can add value and improve both clinical outcomes as well as the patient experience. On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing. We have commenced pilots in a handful of US cities to improve awareness, identification and engagement with the importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health. Our philosophy is this, the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night, and the consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business over the longer term and on a deeper level. This partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care. There are nearly 400 million people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide. We don't believe these people are well served by global healthcare systems today and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions. We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions. Technology such as our Propeller platform helps how patients are communicated to, it helps how they are encouraged in the medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual person. We believe that technology combined with world leading medical equipment can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression. We will be there with Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy managed by the Propeller platform. We will be there with Stage 2 and Stage 3 COPD patients as they add portable oxygen therapy to their care. We will also be there with Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD patients as they commence non-invasive ventilation therapy and ultimately life support ventilation therapy. We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health COPD platform, helping the patient, helping their caregivers and loved ones, as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes. Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and healthcare systems. The digital health opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build and we are making good progress. In December Propeller was included the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts first formulary for digital health solutions. In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger and from Rite Aid. This was access directly from the Propeller app via my pharmacy feature within that smartphone application. We will update you on the milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as healthcare systems as we move forward throughout 2020. Finally, I'd like to focus on our software as a service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the out of hospital SAAS portfolio for long-term growth. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions focused on home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers. Our SAAS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare acquisition that we left during November. We estimate that the weighted average market growth rate of these sectors we compete in is in the high single digits, excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SAAS portfolio grew in line with market in Q2. Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long-term. As we reached the fourth anniversary of our Brightree tree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong [Technical Difficulty] in our home medical equipment or HME sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta. We just passed the one year anniversary without MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter and we are increasing our investments in our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis. This investment is focused on new module introduction for our MatrixCare platform, so that we can ensure that we're able to grow and share in our skilled nursing facility as well as home health and hospice sectors as we move forward. We're doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio. And we have all the elements in place to do that. It took around 24 months to see strong sustainable returns from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree. We think we can meet or beat that timeline for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently making. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as the new preferred partner for home health and hospice software for Cerner's customers. It is early days in that partnership and things are going very well. We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution. Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team, with customers learning of the benefits of our MatrixCare, home health and hospice software. We are excited to drive growth from this partnership. The rich interoperability between our two solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed and customers as well as their patients and residents. I would like to take a moment to announce and exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in the process of completing. Just this week Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply. The combination of Brightree's technology and logical services with this new SnapWorx technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation. For our HME customers, the combination of these two technologies Brightree and SnapWorx will increase patient adherence and increase operational efficiency. We expect the transaction to close very shortly. The acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially. However, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year 2021. In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improved software solutions across outside the hospital healthcare sectors. We see a future where patients seamlessly transfer from HME to skilled nursing facilities to home health providers to hospice providers and beyond with reduced costs and increased efficiency resulting in better system outcomes as well as a high quality of life for the person in out of hospital care. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. The first half of fiscal year 2020 was strong, and we are well positioned to grow through the second half of fiscal 2020 and beyond. The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy. We are focused on our triple aim; first, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and third, to improve quality of life to the ultimate customer, the patient. With that all hands go over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett? Brett Sandercock : Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was 736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were 408 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled 242 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments; US, Canada and Latin America device sales were 204 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales was 204 million, an increase of 19% of the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales of 162 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was 79 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 11%. Globally in constant currency terms device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was 87 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustments to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and acquisition related expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Note that this quarter for GAAP reporting purposes we are now reflecting the portion of amortization of acquired intangibles attributable to develop technology in our cost of sale, rather than being allocated to operating expenses. We've made this change along with SEC disclosure guidance. This mainly [ph] will disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP profit ratios going forward. We have included reconciliation of both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin in our press release. Going forward I will reference this non-GAAP metric because I believe it is the best measure of our underline gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved to 59.7% in the December quarter compared to 59.1% in the same quarter last year. Compared to the prior year, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points, this was predominantly attributable to viable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were 171 million, an increase a 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 8%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 23.3% compared to 24.8% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the remaining two quarters of fiscal year 2020. R&D expenses for the quarter were 50 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 18%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.8% contains a 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was 20.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock based compensation expense for the quarter was 14.1 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 219.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 176.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 10.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rates for the quarter with 11.6%. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 20.3 million associated with the vesting of employee share based compensation in particular the tax deduction associated with the vesting of executive performance documents in November, Excluding the impact from this benefit, our GAAP effective the tax rate would have been 21.6%. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for the second half of fiscal year 2020 will bring the range of 19% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.10. Our diluted earnings per share were also favorably impacted by the text benefit that I've just discussed. Excluding the impact of this guidance our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.07. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was 69.9 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by the timing of tax payments with 111 million in tax paid in our second quarter. Additionally, we made the payment for our settlement to the US Department of Justice of 40.6 million this quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 25.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 45.5 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of 56.1 million. We recorded equity losses of 6.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with a Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately 6 million in equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. At December 31, we had 1.3 billion in gross debt and 1.1 billion in net debt. Our total assets were 4.4 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. Finally, to recap, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross Margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q2 non-GAAP operating profit up 21% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SAAS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that I'll hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great, thank you Brett. We'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and if you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue. Christine. We're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon, guys and Good morning to Brett out in Australia. Mick Farrell : Thank you. Margaret Kaczor : And you may be the first one for me is on mask growth. Obviously, you guys continue to do very, very well from that perspective. So as we look at the last maybe 12 to 18 months, can you give us a sense of the relative impact of new product launches, especially in the white spaces maybe that you weren't in before, the resupply agreements that you kind of referenced, a little bit at JP Morgan, market growth and general share taking and the idea is as we look forward how're the moving dynamics between those categories, and how do you kind of adjust your strategy to keep performance high? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah, thanks for your question, Margaret. And as you noted, there's a number of factors contributing to this very strong mask growth that we had, 16% constant currency on a global basis, and even taking out some of the software just well up there in the mid-teens. You hit on pretty much all of them. There's an increased adherence that we're driving through our digital health solutions when we're achieving 87% adherence, when the doctor is using AirView and the patient is using myAir, and all the digital techs in play that drives up our mask growth. Secondly, when there's resupply and patients have the opportunity if they want to, to participate in getting a fresh mask as their old mask becomes used, and we are partnering with Brightree, Connect, and with ResMed ReSupply to provide that and the acquisition of SnapWorx will help. And then thirdly and really importantly, these last 15 months, the steady flow of four really exciting new mask innovations. Interestingly, these mask innovations aren't to replace a previous product, but to go after underserved or under met customer needs. And we call the minimalist category and the freedom category where people move through different positions during sleep; prone, left, right, sleepers want a Freedom mask and people who had some claustrophobia or want small, larger masks go to the minimalist category, and the F30 that we just launched is right in the heart of both of those. So it's all the above contributing to this really strong growth. We still think that the market growth right is in the high-single digits for masks. And we took really good share during this December quarter. Our job and challenge is to keep driving all those things : resupply, adherence, mask innovation and we plan to do just that. Margaret Kaczor : Thanks guys. Mick Farrell : Thanks Margaret. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Matthew Mishan : Great and thank you for taking the questions, hi, just a follow up on the market share gains in masks. Are you winning new patients at a higher market share clip or are you able to convert existing sleep apnea patients from competitors and getting them to switch? Mick Farrell : Yeah, Matthew, that's a really good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep Division to walk through that. Jim Hollingshead : Good morning, Matthew. I'm down in Australia. So I hope you can all hear me as well. Matthew Mishan : I can hear you just fine. Jim Hollingshead : Yeah, it's a combination of both. We feel very confident in our overall position with mask that we\u2019ve had so many masks launched, and and as Mick referenced, we've had several mask launches in the last 15 months. All of them have been successful launches. We now have a very wide portfolio. It's the widest portfolio offering of mask on the market. So, we continue to take new patient share across all three mask categories. I'm sure we're likely to also be getting competitors switching, and there's less market data available on that dynamic, but we're very confident we're taking new patient share pretty successfully. Matthew Mishan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sean Laaman : Good morning, Mick. Hope you're well. My question relates to something you announced last quarter, and I wonder if you can give a bit of an update on how this Novartis deal with Propeller, is there any update there and how that might be tracking? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Sean. Well, we don't talk in our core business or in our new software businesses about individual customers or partners until things are public and moving along, but there was a public data last quarter from our work with pilot trials with both GSK and Novartis in the Propeller area looking at inhaled pharmaceutical medicines. Look, the beauty of it \u2013 as I sort of described in the opening remarks, the beauty of Propeller is it provides an end-to-end platform to help us take care of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And so, Stage 1 and 2, with Propeller, we can take care of the patients, ensure they have the medicines that their doctor prescribed for them but also engage with that person because they're going to \u2013 it's a progressive disease, they're going to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD. And so our goal with Propeller is not just to have a partnership with pharma company A or B, but it's to really create a platform where we help end-to-end management of a person as they move through disease progression and it helps us engage with that person to help them adhere to their therapy, whether that therapy is the pharmaceutical inhaler or that therapy is a portable oxygen concentrated or that therapy as they move forward is a non-invasive ventilator or a life support ventilator. And so that's our goal with these partnerships. As we hit milestones during 2020 on the pharma side and as we hit milestones on the healthcare system side, we'll give updates on that. But look, yes, we did talk to the MAGNIFY trial that we're still enrolling patients for with Novartis. That's in its early days. So we will give updates on the clinical data, but also importantly commercial partnerships as they move forward through 2020. Thanks for your question, Sean. Sean Laaman : Yeah, thank you Mick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is open. John Deakin-Bell: Good morning. My question just relates to the increase in the SG&A, obviously, you've got fantastic leverage from that and I think we've talked about it previously, but the 2% underlying seems a \u2013 I think that's a record low numbers for you. And just give us a sense perhaps, of how that might look over the next six months and maybe going forward or should it return back to the kind of mid-single digit levels? Mick Farrell : So I'll hand that to Brett who's down in Sydney. Brett Sandercock : Yeah, thanks. Hi, John. Yeah, it was a low this quarter. And we did benefit, certainly from much lower litigation related expenses this quarter relative to last year. So that did certainly moderate that growth rate. In my guidance, I said, I think will revert back to the range of 23 to 25 for the second half, which would suggest that it will track higher in terms of growth rates for SG&A at least in the back half, but certainly helped by some reduction or significant reduction in litigation costs coming through this quarter relative to last year was probably the single biggest driver. And that certainly motivated the growth rate. And try to adjust for that in that kind of range above given as a percentage of revenue going forward to be a better indicator, I think. John Deakin-Bell: That's helpful. Thanks Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin from UBS. Your line is open. Mick Farrell : Saul, you may be on mute. Saul Hadassin : No, I'm not. Can you hear me? Mick Farrell : We can hear you now. Yes. Saul Hadassin : Great, thanks. Yeah, just a question for Brett, Brett just on gross margin, I'm just wondering if you can give some color on the underlying sleep and respiratory care business to what the gross margin has done ex acquisition contribution and usually provide an outlook for the rest of the fiscal year for gross margin as well. Can you just give us that some color there too? Thanks. Brett Sandercock : Yeah, I mean, I think going forward the second half, I think we'll be consistent with where we are, would be an estimate on the gross margin, as you know, a lot of moving parts on that. That would be our expectation. If you look at the acquisitions, we did \u2013 [indiscernible] halfway through the quarter, but fairly \u2013 it's kind of fairly minimal impact this quarter, the big drivers of that year-on-year growth or expansion of that gross margin around the product mix. And that's really being driven by that out performance you're seeing in mask growth and that's typically high margins, what you would see on devices so that that's the biggest impact. And then we're still seeing manufacturing efficiencies, some around logistics and so on as well. And they continue to come through on gross margin, so they're the two big drivers this quarter. Saul Hadassin : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Shane Storey from Wilson HTM Limited. Your line is open. Shane Storey : Yeah, hi, thanks. Just looking again, back at the US mask business kind of just from another angle, you spoke about the adherence in resupply. But have you measured the step up in the number of mask per patient per year say, over the last 12 to 18 months and the last reference point that I've got is may be a tick under two per patient per year? So any observations around that might be very useful. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah, Shane thanks for your question. I think there's a whole portfolio of customers doing different levels of resupply in different countries around the world. If you take the example of France, there's a government mandated requirement that you provide to masks, two masks per patient per year. And it's different in all the 140 countries. Yeah, you focused on the US growth, which was strong. And yes, the last public number we didn't talk about that was 1.9 masks per patient per year. But look out of the 5000 customers in the US there's a broad spectrum of adoption of Brightree. Resupply, Brightree Connect, ResMed resupply, and technologies like SnapWorx that we just acquired. And so there's a broad range. But Jim, do you want to \u2013 Jim Hollingshead, do you want to provide any further color as to what you'd want to share on mask supply metrics? Jim Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks Mick and thanks Shane. I would just add to add to a mix that just a couple things. The first one is the trend is we don't we don't talk about the number of publicly obviously, but the trend in the US has been steadily slowly, but steadily up over the last several years. And we attribute that both to the range of things Mick talked about earlier in the call. So better adherence tools that we're providing our platforms, better masks lead to better adherence initially and therefore better long term adherence and also the adoption of resupply platforms by our HME customers. So the trend is slowly and steadily up. It's still well below Medicare and commercial parallel levels and so it's a good trend and there's still a lot of opportunity. Shane Storey : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners. Your line is open. Steve Wheen : Hey, good afternoon guys. My question is just on specs [ph] businesses and growth rate there. I was wondering if you could help us reconstruct that growth rate, particularly between MatrixCare and Brightree and perhaps as part of that, to give us an update as to your understanding of how those businesses are performing since you've been acquired. I guess, with reference to the EPS outlook that you provided at the time of the acquisitions. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Steve. That allows us to talk to our investment in SAAS and again SAAS this quarter was 12% of our global revenue. And so it's a sector that we're calling out and you'll see that in our financials. It's a very hyper competitive sector, when you look at HME software, you look at skilled nursing facility software and you look at home health and hospice software, so I'm going to be really hesitant to give detailed market share and/or growth rates within each of those sectors. What I said on the prepared remarks is true that cost \u2013 if you look at ResMed's weighted average revenue across HME, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice, as well as the others private duty home care and client communities. The weighted average market growth rate in those sectors is in that high single digit. And during the December quarter over that portfolio we held share, we grew at the \u2013 taking out the acquisition benefit that gave us 37% growth. We grew in that high single digit on our weighted average portfolio. One thing I'll say is we've \u2013 when we hit April here in 2020, we will have and Brightree four years. And as you guys remember, because you followed the stock for a long time, the first two years with Brightree we were investing. Yeah, we put some new management team leaders in there we brought in new CEO, new CTO and some skill sets in R&D. We're doing very similar things now in our MatrixCare journey. And so I'm not going to break it out in detail, but qualitatively I'll say that the investments that we put in those first two years into Brightree are really starting to pay off. We've got new logos, new customers, new modules, and we're taking share, the growth is picking up. And at MatrixCare we're making those investments today in more R&D, more management skills and capabilities and looking obviously back in synergies across our portfolio. So I think we can meet or beat the timing of our Brightree investments and the strong and sustainable growth that we're now getting out of that in our MatrixCare investment. Steve Wheen : Thanks Mick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Low from JP Morgan. Your line is open. David Low : Thanks very much. Just a quick one from me, you mentioned that the mask sales included some software revenues, just wondering if you could explain what that is and how much contribution that will make going forward? Mick Farrell : Yeah, there's a little bit of that. I'll hand it to Brett to go through the financial details on that. Brett Sandercock : Sure. The probably the bigger one there is the \u2013 just through the software related to the \u2013 or the platform related to Propeller acquisition. So that's kind of \u2013 that's probably the biggest single delta, but there are a few other things there, but that's probably the biggest one. David Low : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much, just obviously looking at the current of coronavirus issue and I think if we go back to size, you might sales of about $5 million of sleep [indiscernible] levels into China. Just wondering if there's any follow through affect to yourself from the current coronavirus. Rob Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It's Rob Douglas speaking. There's a pretty dynamic situation going on at the moment in China. And so tracking, it's difficult, but we are tracking very closely. In terms of our China business, we think obviously the hospital's going to be very busy on their respiratory. So there'll be a lot of focus on that. We would expect to see increased demand for ventilators, whether it's of the same relative scale to size or not, we don't know yet. We're actually working hard on our local supply chain there. Remember, we've got a really good team in China building good ventilators in China for China. And so, in fact, some of that team has been working in some of these hospitals and Jason Sun, Head of China they're local heroes who are really staying on the ground there and helping look after patients in the face of this terrible disease. So I wouldn't be predicting exactly what the impact will be on an overall scale, there will be an offset as well, likely the hospitals won't be looking at sleep patients for a while. So there may be some in asleep in China, but it's unlikely all of that to be material. Just one other point in terms of the overall business, we've mentioned many times our supply chain isn't configured around China. Most of its not in China, but there are some second and third tier suppliers in their way work closely with them at the moment. We wouldn't expect this to be a problem, but we'll have to keep a close eye on them. Andrew Goodsall : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is open. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning, gentlemen and thank you for taking my question. Just to continue the discussion on the SaaS business and probably most specifically previously we talked about resupply expansion and that given over about six months in, can you share how the resupply program outside of sleep apnea is tracking and what your expectations are for the remainder of financial year '20? Mick Farrell : Thanks Lyanne. Yeah, so you're talking about our expansion of \u2013 our resupply capabilities, we went into some diabetic supplies and orthotics and urology products and so those \u2013 they're not a material part of ResMed's overall business. But they were a good expansion of ResMed's capabilities to look off to the HME sector beyond just sleep apnea and sleep app supplies that we are very good at making sure that they work through and so it's not material to our overall business. I'm not going to break out the specifics and other than to say they're going well and customers are adopting them and I'd love them to become a material part of our overall business to be able to break out like that. But it's early days and it's a good strategic ply of Brightree to sort of expand their capability with workflow optimization and both the combination of live call and tech that we use on masks and sleep apnea supplies. It's the same technology used on those diabetics and those other areas of HME. And so we're just helping our customers grow their businesses and get appropriate resupply when customers are there and requiring for authorization for it as well. So sorry, I can't get more specific than that, Lyanne. Lyanne Harrison : Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning. So would you be able to give us an update on the outlook for competitive bidding? So what are your expectations in terms of reimbursement changes in 2021? And if there is potentially a decline in mask reimbursements, how is ResMed thinking about responding? Thanks Mick Farrell : So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. Dave? David Pendarvis : Yeah. Thanks Gretel. We continue to be at the same place we were last quarter. And that is we're waiting along with everyone else in the industry what the results are, the competitive bids that are in. We expect them at the end of the North American summer. So sometime around August or September and we'll know where the results are. We are pleased with the efforts that we made and others in the industry made to educate bidders, so they understand the portfolio nature of the lead item pricing and the impact of bidding on CPAP reimbursement on mask reimbursement. We're comfortable that that we conduct business with our customers now on a portfolio basis. And however, reimbursement settles out in the Medicare space. We expect to there'll continue to be strong demand for mask resupply that will continue to be important part of our customers business and it'll be an important part for patients' long term adherence success. So we don't see any significant changes in the trajectory going forward. But obviously, like with everyone else, we just have to wait and see what the actual reimbursement amounts come out to be. Gretel Janu : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from line of David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is open. David Bailey : Yeah, good morning, guys. Just for me Brett, cash flow looked a bit awake this quarter. Just wondering if you could talk through some of the moving parts there? You've called out the Department of Justice litigation settlement. Just talk us through what normalized tax cash payment would look like? And then also net interest on a cash basis for the quarter will be great. Brett Sandercock : Yeah, so yeah, was impacted by plenty of tax payments as well, if you look at it underlying, excluding those I still think actually pretty strong on the cash flow front. Normalize is probably \u2013you're probably more like around the kind of 40 million a quarter. And I think going into Q3, it's going to be more like that. So that's impacted for this quarter. Expect Q3 and Q4 to be much better in terms of cash flow performance. And in the next one was that on the interest, interest expense? David Bailey : Managed expenses, it is broadly monitor [ph] the income statement you're talking about. Brett Sandercock : Yeah, pretty close. You wouldn't \u2013 that's a good proxy. It's not that far different to that. David Bailey : Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Cooper : Thanks for taking the question. I was going to follow up to one of the previous questions. So the competitive bidding, I know it's a bit early to speculate on the particular outcome. I just guess I'm more interested in how you expect to manage the discussion with the DNA partners yourselves. Would you expect positive and negative changes to be passed on to you one to one? Or is there an outcome here where, I guess you bet more downside than the upside given there's a possible agreement here were some categories going to increase and some decrease just any thoughts around how you think that would be helpful. Mick Farrell : So I'll hand that for David and if Jim, you want to add any color from the customer perspective, as well, but Dave you first and then Jim? David Pendarvis : Sure, I mean, we already have ongoing discussions with our customers. We view them as good partners with us and we have robust discussions where they would like to get the best prices they can and we want to make sure that we serve them as best we can. That dynamic won't change with competitive bidding or anything else. So we expect to continue to have good discussions with them and the environment for the last year and a half and for the balance of calendar year '20 is that there's been about a 2% increase each year in the Medicare reimbursement. And so that's obviously contributed to a benign pricing environment that we've been experiencing for the last period of time. But we didn't participate with our customers in their bidding, obviously, they made their own decisions, we're confident that the bidding process will be a more fair one this time, and we're hoping it'll end up with a process that will be able to be good for the overall industry. But in terms of individual customer negotiations, Jim, you might want to comment on that. Jim Hollingshead : Thank you, Dave. I'll just add to that, I mean, I think that's very well, but we do have very good relationships with all of our customers with our key customers and we'll work through it together. The other thing I would just remind everybody is a Medicare fee for service is the minority part of the market. So it's an important part of the market, but it's a small percentage of the market. Operator : And your next question comes from line of Mike Matson from Needham. Your line is open. Mike Matson : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just have, I guess one more competitive bidding question. So with \u2013 specifically with non-invasive ventilation, that's the first time it's been included, I think could see a fairly steep decline. So can you maybe comment on what you expect there? And then also, I don't know if you could quantify how much of your sales are coming from non-invasive ventilation in the US, but just to help us understand what the exposure is. Mick Farrell : Dave and Jim, you again, David Pendarvis : Up again, so thanks, Mike. Non-invasive ventilation obviously is in two different categories. One what we would characterize as life support ventilation is the new category that it's now going to be a competitive bidding, our air curve ranges the buy levels have previously been in competitive bidding. So that's not changing. It's more on the life support side. And that is newly there, but they're also had been reductions in that reimbursement over the past few years leading up to this. So it's not necessarily the case that you'll see the same kinds of reductions that you saw in the round two kind of range previously for the sleep products. Nevertheless, we think it's important that patients can benefit particularly COPD patients can benefit from these devices, they ought to get into the hands and that's of those patients and it's certainly a device that requires a lot of service. A lot of people in the in the home are making sure the device is working appropriately, so you need to have a strong reimbursement for it. It's a smaller group of customers who actually do this kind of business, and they're probably likely to be focused on what their real cost of serving are. So again, we're optimistic that our customers are sophisticated customers, they'll bid appropriately, so that they can make an adequate margin to be able to provide that service that's really, particularly in this area very well needed. So we'll wait and see how it goes. But we don't break out specifically our sales of life support anywhere in the US or otherwise, but thanks. Mike Matson : Okay, thanks and then just would SnapWorx, maybe just comment on what that brings to the table they didn't already have with Brightree? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah, so SnapWorx is a technology that adds to Brightree end-to-end capabilities that SnapWorx has to partner with the HME. So it goes beyond just the live call and technology capability. They have provided to a number of customers and ability to further reach out to customers. And we had observed this software that was partnering with our Brightree platform and performing really well with those customers. And so we had a relationship with SnapWorx over the last 12, 24, 36 months and we've seen them really grow into a really good technology talking and the Brightree team looked at the technology from the team there in Nashville, Tennessee that created this tech and the entrepreneurs that created it. And we're really excited not only by what they're achieving in the market, which has better adherence and better engagement with both the HME and really importantly, with the end user customer. And what I bring it back which is the patient, what I bring it back to this is some data, some clinical data that we presented from the 5.5 billion knots of data that show that as you increase adherence, and as you engage with the patient and resupply the two add to each other. And some data we just released last quarter shows that for every hour of sleep, we reduce the total healthcare costs for inpatient by 8%. So this is all tied together, right. So Brightree, resupply \u2013 ResMed resupply and SnapWorx will increase adherence, drive increased mask resupply and that will also through that increased adherence lower the costs of the total healthcare system by 8% for every hour of sleep after those seven hours and so I think that combination is really powerful of now Brightree plus SnapWorx. Now, it's early days, we're just literally going through the finals of this acquisition, but watch us over the next 12, 24 months and we'll give you updates obviously every quarter as to how well that integration on that technology's going. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. This is Mike on for Suraj. We read recently that Fitbit is adding an oxygen variation graph for select users with an FDA submission for sleep apnea diagnosis somewhere in the near term here. I'm just curious if you see that as longer term helping to increase the number of OSA patients treated. Mick Farrell : Yeah, Mike thanks for the question. And look, it's really interesting that tech companies are really getting involved in the field of, I call it health wellness and sleep wellness is a big part of that. Obviously, we have our partnership with Verily and I have the Google watch as part of their baseline study and they're doing some identification, I'd call it. You call the diagnosis; I call it identification of potentially at risk people for poor sleep suffocation or sleep apnea. I think what Fitbit has is along those same lines and what they try to do, and that Fitbit is now part of the Google portfolio. I believe there's an acquisition in line there. It'll probably add on to that capability of, if you see de-saturations in the oxygen, there's a higher likelihood. There's other causes potentially of those de-sat, but there's a high likelihood of sleep apnea, so I would call it more in the medical terms a screener that will then hopefully identify and engage a person that maybe I have a sleep issue, maybe I have a breathing issue and indicate to them they need to get on to the true diagnostic pathway. And then we can sort of bring them into the identification, engagement enrollment capability we're trying to perform. But look, Jim you run the global fleet business, is there any further detail you think about some of these tech companies and the ability for them to identify more patients? Jim Hollingshead : Sure yet, Mike, thanks for the question. I think it's an unreserved good that companies like Fitbit are putting in place technologies to help consumers understand how they're sleeping and whether they might have a sleep disorder. And we know that there's 936 million people globally, who suffer from sleep apnea, the vast majority of them don't know it. And forever in the industry, one of the bottlenecks has been driving awareness on the one hand and then making objective screening and then diagnosis, on the other hand easier and so when companies like Fitbit \u2013 there's a whole range of companies that are now doing something like that in the space. When they when they decide to put that out in consumers hands. It's fantastic for us and for those patients more importantly. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks Mick and Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : So maybe just two quick ones, one just on local manufacturing just given bushfires, obviously in Australia, so any update just on that manufacturing plant. And then just one on legislation in the US, H.R.2771 just to maintain the 50-50 blended rate in rural areas, is there any update on actually where that sits and the likelihood that it gets to Congress this year? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the questions Anthony. I'll ask Rob to answer the first one around manufacturing and then Dave to answer the second one around the H.R. Rob Douglas : Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. As we said the ResMed supply chain is configured around multiple sources. At this stage most of our manufactured products come from our Singapore plant, but we have full capability in the Sydney plant that does often focus on newer and more complex products. But we have full process capability in both plants. The fire season in Australia has been devastating. However, it hasn't actually gone into the outskirts of Sydney, which would actually make the whole thing a lot worse if it did. And today, we haven't seen any interference with that at all. But if there was interference that wouldn't overly affect us because of our ability to reconfigure. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. David Pendarvis : And as to the bill and we certainly support that bill. Again, we think it's important that our customers receive the appropriate reimbursement and particularly in rural areas. It's difficult to do that. So we certainly support 2771. I think it's \u2013 you may have noticed there's a lot going on in Congress these days. So it's a little difficult to get anything through. But there is an opportunity in the middle part of the year, when I think some of the Medicare extenders come up for renewal, that there could be a push to get this along with some of the other items the industry supports in place. So we'll have to wait and see. But we certainly support that. And at a minimum, Congress indicating their support the industry is positive. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is open. David Bailey : You know like I'm just following up on Saul's question actually, just wondering if you're able to quantify the contribution of those acquisitions to US or America's masks and accessories revenues for the quarter that would be helpful. Mick Farrell : Yeah, I said in the prepared \u2013 thanks for the question David. I said in the prepared remarks, it's the \u2013 so if you take that sort of global mask growth rate of 16%, and you take out Propeller software, you're going to be in the mid-teens, so maybe 100 basis points or something on global. And if you take the US growth, we're all pretty \u2013 I mean most of the Propeller software is the US growth on masks was 19% on a constant currency basis. If you take out Propeller and the software, you're about 200 basis points there, you're probably around 17% growth in the US territory, so 16 becomes around 15 and 19 would become around 17 David. I think that answers both your questions. And thanks to everyone for spending an extra eight minutes since we were eight minutes delayed due to the phone lines there, but appreciate that all. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Hey, great. Thanks, Christine. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work. You produce these great numbers that we get to report. You help people sleep better, you help people breathe better, you help people live better lives outside the hospital in a 140 countries, which is pretty amazing. Thanks for all that you do today and every day and we'll talk to all of you again in around 90 days. Amy? Amy Wakeham : Great, thank you all again, for joining us today and to echo Mick, thanks for bearing with us through the audio difficulties. If you do have any questions or additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. As previously mentioned, all the documents along with the transcript and hopefully a clean replay of today's call will be available on our website. Christine, you can now close the call. Operator : This concludes ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Diego. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining us, and I hope you all remain healthy and safe during these times.  This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today.  Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results from various remote locations across San Diego and Sydney are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock; as well as other members of management who will be available during the Q&A portion of our call. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ, particularly in light of the highly uncertain global environment we are currently operating in and the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus on our business. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.  With that, I'd like to go ahead and now turn the call over to Mick. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today. These are unprecedented times, as Amy just noted. We are in the midst of a global pandemic, which is having profound effects on public health, particularly the most vulnerable among us. During this time, our top 3 goals here at ResMed are simple. Goal one is the preservation of life, helping people breathe with world-class ResMed ventilators and ventilation masks, while their own immune system fights against this novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. Goal two is the safety and health of our amazing team of 7,500 ResMedians, providing solutions in 140 countries worldwide, because without our people, we can't help anyone breathe better. And goal three is the ongoing delivery of world-leading products and services to treat sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as well as the ongoing production of market-leading software to take care of over 110 million people with care delivered by home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, hospice, and importantly, in the place where people prefer to be, their home.  I've never been more proud to call myself a ResMedian than I am today. Every one of our global team is fully engaged in the COVID-19 crisis. They are demonstrating impressive feats of ingenuity, compassion and drive to support patients, clinicians, providers, health systems and beyond. My e-mail inbox is overflowing daily with stories of ResMed heroes, including frontline workers, such as our own respiratory therapists and clinicians as well as ResMedians, who are showing up every day, using all of our updated safety procedures to source ventilator components from around the world, to produce ventilators and masks and tubing and software and deliver these life-changing solutions worldwide.  To share just one example from many is the story of a ResMed hero from our China team, actually in Wuhan, in Hubei province, who donned a full hazmat suit every day for the first 10 weeks of the corona outbreak in that region. He was setting up thousands of people on ResMed ventilators and ResMed masks, including a ventilator that we call the guardian angel or GA ventilator produced right there in China. We don't know how many lives this gentleman saved there in Hubei province, but I have the good fortune of calling him, my ResMed teammate. So to all those ResMed heroes, I say thank you and that I'm inspired by you and how you stepped up to help patients at the start of this crisis there in January and for the duration now through April and beyond. As a global company providing solutions in over 140 countries, we have mobilized our efforts and resources to address COVID-19 as this deadly disease moves from region to region. We have accelerated production and distribution of invasive ventilators, noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel devices as well as ventilation masks for the patients who need them most, no matter where they live.  We produced over 52,000 noninvasive ventilators, including bilevels and invasive ventilators during the quarter. This is a threefold increase on our production from the same quarter in 2019, living up to the expectations that we set publicly. We have also driven a tenfold increase in our ventilation mask production, actually more than tenfold. We are aligning distribution of these ventilation products worldwide using a global ethical epidemiology-based model of ventilation needs based on our models of the surge of COVID-19 patients around the world. And our key guiding principle is the preservation of life.  We can and will do more over the coming days, weeks, months and quarters to support health care systems as COVID-19 continues to impact countries across Asia, Europe and North America and with future patient surges just starting to begin in South America, Africa, Middle East and beyond.  We have been able to achieve these outcomes while ensuring that we always place the health, safety and wellbeing of our ResMed team at the top of our priority list. Without our people, as I said earlier, we can do nothing. Our actions have included work-from-home policies for all whose job function allows for that. We have instituted noncontact temperature screening, mask wearing policies and physical distancing protocols for all of our supply chain, production, distribution and technical service teams worldwide. While we have around 65% of our global team now working from home, these important jobs such as production, distribution and tech service just can't be done from home. We have established world-class safety and quality procedures in all of our manufacturing plants, distribution centers and offices, and we're ready to get back to work as cities and countries plan to do that. Safety and quality are part of our DNA at all times. And today, more than ever, these capabilities enable us here at ResMed to support our customers with a sustainable supply of products, services and solutions throughout this COVID-19 crisis and beyond. I also want to express my gratitude and appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of people beyond the boundary of ResMed, especially the frontline health care workers in hospitals worldwide. Respiratory therapists, critical care nurses, critical care doctors and many others have demonstrated extraordinary leadership and personal sacrifice at this time. These clinicians are triaging people with symptoms into various therapeutic pathways depending on the changing acuity of each individual with this novel coronavirus from CPAP therapy to bilevel therapy, to more advanced noninvasive ventilation as well as to full endotracheal intubation with invasive ventilation for the patients who need that.  These clinicians are using ResMed ventilators and ResMed ventilation masks with direct person-to-person engagement, which even with full personal protective equipment still includes significant risk for that clinician. We are working with customers worldwide to drive digital pathways to try to minimize unneeded person-to-person interaction. Examples of this include remote monitoring of ventilation devices, telehealth solutions and virtual patient population management. We have over 11 million devices with available connectivity to our cloud-based solutions, including myAir and AirView. We have over 13 million patients as well as over 6 billion nights, 6 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud.  We had a running start in the field of digital health well before this COVID-19 crisis. One of the few positive benefits out of this awful crisis is that it has brought to the forefront the importance of digital health for the health and safety of respiratory therapists, respiratory nurses and critical care physicians. Digital health also brings benefits of more scalability, more cost efficiency and better outcomes for patients. Throughout the quarter, despite all the changes brought by this coronavirus, we have continued to execute on our long-term ResMed 2025 strategy, including digital health, expanding end-to-end pathways for sleep apnea, for COPD and for asthma as well as building the world's best out-of-hospital health care software network. Fundamentally, we believe and continue to believe, through this crisis even more so, that the future of health care is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where ResMed wins today. The COVID-19 pandemic has proved an interesting point. The more we can establish noncontact digital health pathways at scale, the better the health of therapists, nurses and physicians and the better the efficacy, the efficiency, the scale and the quality of care for patients. We have accelerated our ability to improve over 250 million lives in outside-the-hospital health care by 2025. The fundamentals of our ResMed business is strong, even as we see uncertainty in the changing kinetics and dynamics of the COVID-19 disease as it continues to move across geographies, from Asia to Europe, to now North America and on to South America, Africa and regions worldwide. We are seeing tailwinds in our business from increased demand of our ventilators such as Astral, Stellar, Lumis as well as our noninvasive ventilators, AirCurve, Flexo and the GA. We are also seeing increased demand for ventilation mask solutions.  We do not know exactly how long the surge of demand will last for each hospital, for each city, for each country and for each region as this COVID-19 virus moves. But as patient flow surges, peaks and then flattens, we are there. And we are getting pretty good at modeling these demand curves using our global COVID-19 epidemiology model of patient flow and the learning from each city that we serve. Currently, a lot of short-term impact also depends on our ability to keep ventilator production at its maximum capacity. And as I mentioned earlier, we are already at 3x last year's production capacity. And we are doing our best to meet the surge and peak flow in multiple geographies worldwide. A key element is -- in our ability to deliver is our ability to source critical components and ship product in response to the incredible demand as this COVID-19 virus moves around the world.  I want to be clear on this point, though. Even as we face increased demand for our products, we are doing everything that we can to keep efficiency high and to keep our costs down. Our primary humanitarian goal is 100% locked. At ResMed, we are committed to enabling access to ventilators for COVID-19 patients in order to preserve life. We are keeping pricing steady, and we will not opportunistically increase prices or per unit profit in our response to COVID-19.  We believe that there will be lessons learned during the crisis that will enhance our ability here at ResMed to drive innovation in the coming quarters, coming years through our research and development pipeline, particularly in the fields of digital health technology as well as our product and software innovation. We are very competitively positioned in these fields today, but we think we will be even more so tomorrow. While balancing our response to the global public health crisis, we have also been executing well in our core business. We have delivered strong growth in our sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across geographies, with solid contributions from our software-as-a-service business during the quarter. In a few minutes, our CFO, Brett Sandercock, will provide the details of our third quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020. But first, I'll provide just a few financial highlights and briefly discuss execution towards our ResMed 2025 strategy along with some milestones for the quarter. So for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we delivered just around $770 million in quarterly revenue, which is up 17% year-over-year, reflecting growth and positive momentum across our product portfolio, software solutions and global markets. As part of our global COVID-19 response, we have seen tailwinds for the increased demand for invasive ventilators and noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel devices, masks and accessories, as I mentioned earlier. We estimate the incremental impact to be approximately $35 million of COVID-19-related revenue during the quarter. So from this $770 million in quarterly revenue, we generated a strong $240 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, enabling us to return cash dividends to shareholders, as declared by our Board today.  We continue to invest in the future growth of our enterprise with double-digit increases in our research and development investments during the quarter. This R&D investment includes shifting resources to ventilators and ventilation masks and clinical research and technical help people to help clinicians, physicians, inventors and people worldwide during the COVID-19 crisis as well as keeping the ongoing innovation work going for our core sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and software-as-a-service businesses. We have set a clear path for ResMed to maintain our position as the global leader in digital health technology, transforming the way health care is delivered for those suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as enabling people to live healthier lives in a portfolio of settings away from the hospital. The execution of our long-term strategy drives progress against our triple aim of : first, slowing chronic disease progression; second, reducing overall health care system costs; and third, improving the quality of life for our ultimate customer, the person who uses our products, to help them sleep better, breathe better and deliver higher quality of life away from the hospital.  We believe that when we help a person sleep better, breathe better and live a better quality of life away from acute care, this positions ResMed to help those people achieve their best health outcome in other chronic disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. We are forming multiple partnerships to drive these long-term health benefits, including our joint venture with Verily and many other private partnerships beyond. Watch this space. We have three priorities that guide our daily focus. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. That's just our clear #1 priority. Number two, to deliver world-leading medical devices and digital health technology to engage physicians, providers and patients so that together, we can improve clinical outcomes, reduce costs and enhance patient experiences. That's our triple aim. And our third priority is to build the world's best software solutions network for health care that is delivered outside the hospital, and we're well on track to do that.  We have advanced on all 3 of these priorities during the quarter, and I'll briefly touch on a few recent highlights to demonstrate areas where we have momentum and are driving innovation. We had an exceptionally strong growth this quarter on a geographic and product basis, including 17% growth globally. Our team delivered strong and distributed geographic growth, including a 12% increase in the combined United States, Canada and Latin America regions as well as an incredibly strong constant currency increase of 27% across the combined Europe, Asia and other regions. As discussed earlier, there was an impact from the COVID-19 surge in demand of ventilation in the quarter of around $35 million in revenue, so that's around 4.5% of the $770 million in revenues for the quarter. In short, our core underlying business remained robust, over and above that of the ongoing surge of demand. On a product basis, during the last 12 months, we improved over 16 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a ResMed complete mask system to help them breathe better and live a better life. Including our digital health solutions for out-of-hospital software in this number, we impacted together over 110 million lives during these last 12 months. The ability to improve these lives is supported by over 6 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud. These data allow us to perform sophisticated data analytics and to drive actionable insights for the benefit of customers, including patients, physicians, providers and health care systems. This makes ResMed the global leader in digital health for our field and the partner of choice for our customers, helping them increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve outcomes. So shifting to a discussion of our core sleep apnea business. We are seeing significant impact from the COVID-19-related lockdowns on new patient diagnoses in sleep. We have seen double-digit declines in diagnosis rates in affected markets. Many sleep clinics, especially hospital clinics are temporarily closed. And many pulmonary and critical care physicians that often work in sleep clinics are shifting their focus to treat COVID-19 patients as the surge comes to their city, their region, their state, their hospital. It is important to note that we have seen the mask and accessories resupply dimension of our business not only maintained, but actually increased during the quarter.  As we look forward, there is uncertainty and it's not clear to what extent the upsurge in ventilation device and ventilation mask revenue will offset the decline in sleep device revenue and whether sleep mask revenue will maintain its growth or decelerate somewhat. But we know these facts, number one, the sleep apnea prevalence remains incredibly high, over 936 million people worldwide. And we know, fact two, that there is a backlog of diagnostic activity for sleep apnea and COPD that many clinics and physicians are preparing to ramp up their home sleep apnea testing, both now during the crisis and in the future as lockdowns are lifted around the world. For the on-premise or in-laboratory tests for sleep apnea, we are modeling how those will scale back up again customer-by-customer, city-by-city and country-by-country as the economy opens up and primary care physician visits and elective medical procedures come back online through telehealth and beyond. Physicians and therapists will then have to work through the backlog of undiagnosed patients that has been built through the COVID-19 lockdown in their region, with a portfolio of both home sleep apnea testing and in-lab tests.  The velocity of the diagnostic pathway return rate will depend on local regulations and behaviors and what we're calling a new normal for patient care. We have real-time experience of the opening back up in some cities in Asia and throughout Europe, and we're starting to see them open up in the U.S. And we have modeled these open-ups carefully to ensure that we can best support customers as they start their home sleep apnea test scale and their in-lab test scale over time to meet the backlog of demand. Even today, around the world, we're working closely with our customers to accelerate these home sleep apnea testing models and remote patient setup on sleep apnea therapy where customers are pursuing those pathways as well as our ongoing remote sleep apnea patient monitoring. And I mentioned earlier, we have over 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices out there in the field and more that are distributed every day.  It's important to note that these types of partnerships aren't new due to COVID-19. These are things we've been working on for years and decades in some states. And we believe these types of digital health and telehealth and remote monitoring models will only increase due to COVID-19 and as we move into a post-COVID-19 world. In terms of digital health innovation, we have recently rolled out a new pilot telehealth over video chat so that the physician can not only access information on Air Solutions and AirView, but it can also interact directly with the patient. And we think that will reduce the need for a recovered COVID-19 patient to return to the emergency room or a physician outpatient setting. We view this as a trend that will be accelerated by a combination of changes in reimbursement methodologies and overall focus on safety and the preventative and health benefits for both the patient and the health care worker.  Solutions like this can provide incredible scale when leveraged across a digital health network, including over 110 million patient lives. As I noted earlier, our investments in research and development grew by double digits in the quarter, and we put these R&D monies to work to expedite the tripling of ventilator production in the quarter and tenfold capacity increase in our ventilation mask production. We have also formed partnerships with clinicians around the world to help with the COVID-19 crisis, to help create and share clinical white paper, best practice solutions in clinical practice to help with COVID-19 ventilation management, including triage between CPAP, oxygen, bilevel therapy, noninvasive ventilation therapy and invasive ventilation therapy. At the same time, though, we have continued to invest in our core businesses for future growth in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and software-as-a-service.  As an example of this innovation in our core sleep apnea business, we introduced during the quarter the AirFit F30i. This is the first CPAP mask with a tube-up design in the full face category. This product now gives ResMed the most complete full face mask portfolio versus all our competition on the planet. So what does this tube-up design of the AirFit F30i do for customers? In essence, it gives the freedom of movement back to that ultimate customer, the patient, so they can sleep naturally in any position. The best lumber architecture follows during the night. The F30i also has an innovative cushion that prevents irritation on the nasal bridge, and it has a quick release elbow that allows users to quickly disconnect and reattach the mask from its tubing, making it very simple to start therapy at the start of the night and to stop therapy in the morning.  All this technology built into the AirFit F30i supports the third tenet of our triple aim, to improve the quality of life for the patient. If they have freedom of movement and don't wake up, that improves their sleep, it improves their day, it improves their life. Clearly, it is very early in the product life cycle for the F30i, and this product was launched amid a pretty unique global environment. However, despite some of the noise in the signal, we've been able to see good early acceptance as physicians, respiratory therapists and that ultimate customer, the patient, recognize the benefit and functionality of the innovation in the F30i.  Additionally, during the quarter, we invested $100,000 in partnership with the not-for-profit American Thoracic Society Foundation through a research grant. The goal of the research and the study is to look at how remote monitoring can help improve the management of patients with COPD. The study aims to detect early changes in lung function from daily recordings and to notify patients and/or physicians when to commence more intensive treatment or to seek high-level medical attention. Nearly 400 million people suffer from COPD worldwide, and we do not believe these people are well served currently by global health care systems. Our vision of better management for COPD patients through the use of digital health technologies will be accelerated from the findings of this study. It's great to partner with the nonprofit ATS Foundation to help this move forward.  As we discussed earlier, COVID-19 has accelerated the movement to fully remote care in our core sleep apnea and ventilation businesses. Looking at our growing digital health solutions for COPD and asthma, the Propeller platform continues to play an important role in keeping patients outside the hospital, out of acute care locations, leveraging the Propeller's world-leading pharmaceutical adherence technology for these diseases. Active use of Propeller technology has actually increased during the COVID-19 crisis. We think this is due to the rising awareness of the importance of respiratory health and the fact that people just don't want to go to acute care settings, and so they're using preventative medicines more to do so. While it's not yet material to ResMed's overall revenue, we are seeing increased interest in Propeller's technology to support health systems with population health. We'll keep you updated on any significant milestones with our pharmaceutical partners as well as our work with global health care system partners throughout calendar year 2020 and 2021 as they adopt the Propeller platform for COPD, asthma and beyond.  Before I transition to a discussion of our out-of-hospital software-as-a-service business, I'd like to recap briefly why we believe that the SaaS business is critical to ResMed's long-term success and how it fits into our broader portfolio. Our consistent view of the evolution of the health care system is that care will be delivered outside the hospital. The contamination of hospitals with COVID-19 is just one of the latest examples of the types of contagions that are present in many hospital locations worldwide. Our vision is to enable a system where a patient can seamlessly transfer across a portfolio of outside hospital care settings, from home care providers to skilled nursing facilities, to home health, to independent living, assisted senior living and beyond. These settings have reduced costs versus the hospital as well as increased efficiency and better health outcomes than the hospital. People are simply happier and healthier in the residential setting of their choice, and the ultimate residence of choice is their home. The SaaS business clearly leverages the global trend for seniors to want to age in place and supports ResMed's continued execution against the triple aim. Our SaaS businesses enable us to participate more deeply in broader chronic disease across a patient's life cycle, creating additional strategic growth options. During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew at 12% from the period a year ago. We are integrating and optimizing this out-of-hospital SaaS portfolio to support long-term growth. We continue to believe that the long-term weighted average growth of the SaaS markets that we serve is in the high single digits. We clearly beat that growth this quarter, and we plan to exceed that rate in the long run as we execute to our SaaS strategy. During the COVID-19 crisis, many out-of-hospital health care settings have switched their use to support overflow from hospitals. And there has also been a reduction in patient flow to these out-of-hospital facilities due to a reduction in elective surgeries at hospitals. Skilled nursing facilities and nursing home volumes have been extremely hard hit by COVID-19, and this will impact our MatrixCare business growth in the coming quarters. We expect market growth in our current portfolio of SaaS businesses that we serve to be in the mid single-digit range for the next few quarters, before its recovery to high single-digit growth in the medium to long term as the COVID-19 surge passes and people return to their primary care physicians and return to their elective surgeries and patient volume returns. In support of the increased growth of the SaaS portfolio, during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply for our HME customers. The combination of Brightree's technology and live call services with this new SnapWorx tech creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation for HME customers. Resupply is an area of the HME business that has been a strong ballast in the boat during the COVID-19 lockdowns. And these types of programs, including Brightree and SnapWorx together, set up our customers for ongoing success and better patient engagement through the crisis and beyond. In summary, the SaaS portfolio is an important driver of our long-term success and a critical enabler of our ability to impact our triple aim. We are investing for long-term growth in SaaS and leadership in this space.  Our performance across the entire ResMed portfolio during the quarter demonstrates the resiliency of our business during, what I would call, extremely challenging global times. And it highlights the dedications of ResMedians all over the world and the dedication of our customers, the clinicians, providers and health systems to deliver for the people who need our help. Looking forward, we are modeling impacts of headwinds and tailwinds from the COVID-19 crisis, with detailed scenarios of impacts by customer, by city, by region and by business line. While we face temporary headwinds in sleep apnea diagnosis and SaaS patient business flows I just talked about, we are also seeing tailwinds from increased demand for our ventilation devices, our ventilation masks around the world. The fundamentals of our overall business is strong, but these are uncertain times and the crisis continues to unfold across geographies, and we don't know exactly how long the related headwinds and the related tailwinds will last. We don't know specifically by each city, country and region how fast they will open up, but we know they will open up. And as we have seen in Asia and Europe, as these economies open up over the coming days, weeks and months, ResMed will be there to serve them. And we know one thing that as they start to open up, there has been and will be a backlog of patients who need the channel's help for sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and out-of-hospital health care needs. We're investing now to be ready for those realities of the open-up so that we can be there to support our customers with the best digital health solutions and the most scalable solutions to help them grow now. We are leading from the front.  The nature of the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of our digital health strategies I mentioned earlier. Our ability to improve over 250 million lives by 2025 in out-of-hospital health care is not only on track, we think it's accelerated these last 3 months. This is the one welcome benefit in what has been incredibly challenging 90 days for every company, not just ResMed in every nation, every government dealing with this crisis. We're glad that we have made extensive investments in remote monitoring, remote patient setup, digital health, population health management over the last 5, 10-plus years that we can now offer and bring to the market to help them when they need it.  The combination of accelerated digital health technology and the recognition of the value of remote monitoring and the projected changes that are already happening in global reimbursement models for digital health, combined with the growing acceptance of virtual diagnosis and virtual setup, represents a new and significant medium to long-term tailwind for the ResMed business. This combined with our strong pipeline of new products and digital health solutions, including sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and the out-of-hospital SaaS gives us strong confidence in our future. We think this is a unique positioning that solidifies our leadership role in global digital health in med tech, but will also support ResMed's growth over the medium to long term. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I'd like to commit that while we have already played a significant role providing tens of thousands of ventilators, many, many more ventilation masks and clinical support to clinicians worldwide to fight the COVID-19 crisis, we are not done. We will do even more in the coming quarter and the coming quarters to deliver more ventilators, more ventilation masks for countries as they go through the patient surge. And we will be there to support health care systems around the world in respiratory medicine and digital health not only during this COVID-19 crisis, but in what we call the new normal post-COVID-19 world that will be more digitally enabled and more digitally connected than ever before.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney. Brett? Brett Sandercock : Right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and some remarks for our Q4 outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $769 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the third quarter were favorably impacted by significant sales of ventilator devices and accessories. We estimate that the incremental revenue benefit from COVID-19-related sales was in the order of $35 million. Excluding this incremental impact, our group revenue increased by 12% in constant currency terms. Taking a closer look at geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $394 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $286 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 27% increase.  By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $196 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $197 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $195 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 29% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $91 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, both device sales and masks and other sales increased by 18% over the prior year quarter.  Software-as-a-service revenue for the third quarter was $90 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 9%.  During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue and an impairment of minority interest investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.  Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 70 basis points to 60% in the March quarter compared to 59.3% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Moving to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $172 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 7% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 22.4% compared to 24.8% reported in the prior year quarter. Given the volatility in potential future revenue outcomes, I will not provide our normal guidance with respect to SG&A as a percentage of revenue. However, looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses to increase in the low single digits compared to the year ago period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $51 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.7% compared to 7.2% in the prior year. We continue to invest in our business, particularly targeted at innovation. This is evidenced by the double-digit growth in R&D expenses in Q3. We believe our long-term commitment to innovation will deliver a sustained competitive advantage.  Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow in the high single digits to low double digits, reflecting our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20 million of the quarter, a decrease of 10% over the prior year quarter, reflecting historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $238 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin and well-managed operating expenses. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 impacts, we still continue to experience solid operating leverage. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $188 million, an increase of 47% over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 14.9%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%.  Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 18% to 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.29, an increase of 45% over the prior year quarter. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 impacts, we estimate our diluted earnings per share were $1.16, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.12. Additionally, during the quarter, we recognized write-downs of $9 million associated with minority equity investments. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $240 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $46 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $56 million. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of our previously announced tuck-in acquisition of SnapWorx. The acquisition will be non-GAAP EPS neutral in year 1 and is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in year 2. However, overall, the impact will not be material to group earnings. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record an underlying run rate of approximately $5 million of equity losses each quarter through fiscal year 2021, associated with the joint venture operations.  Given the unprecedented nature of current events, I would like to make some comments on our financial health. Strong balance sheet has always been a hallmark of ResMed and is most valued by investors in times of economic uncertainty. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $353 million, having generated $240 million in operating cash flow during the third quarter and $472 million in the first 9 months of our fiscal year 2020. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. We had total assets of $4.5 billion. Our debt levels remain modest. And at March 31, we had a further $895 million available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position is strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are tightly managing expenses, cash flow and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. Dividends are important to many of our shareholders, and the declaration of our dividend reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.  Turning to our fourth quarter outlook. At a high level, we expect to see continued strong growth in our respiratory care business and expect incremental respiratory care revenue to significantly exceed in Q3. However, we expect to see a headwind in sleep device sales in Q4 in response to a temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. Masks and accessories have shown resiliency over the past 3 months, which reflects the insulating value of the large patient installed base. Like many other companies, we are experiencing high uncertainty in the current environment with circumstances and information changing almost on a daily basis. And as a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Brett. Thanks, Mick. [Operator Instructions]. Diego, we're now ready for the Q&A portion. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Lyanne Harrison : Congratulations on a great result. I'm very interested in, I guess, the uplift that you did on ventilators, and you maybe mentioned you got $35 million tailwind for this quarter due to the threefold increase in the devices production [indiscernible] in ventilators by far. Can you tell me whether or not you are able to increase your volume of production of ventilators as you go through quarter 4 and to meet any increased demand in other countries. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Lyanne. Thanks for the question. And yes, you're right. We had 2 separate metrics that we sort of laid out there. One that we sold an extra $35 million worth of ventilator in the quarter. Those were from our inventory and stuff that we produced in Q2 and some in Q3 and so that was a $35 million tailwind for our business, and we expect some of that certainly to continue as the surge continues worldwide into Q4. And then in addition to that, we tripled our production from a year ago, and we made over 52,000 noninvasive ventilators, bilevel devices and invasive ventilators.  So your question of, can we continue and/or increase the production capacity? And the answer is absolutely yes. We are constrained on some key components for the invasive ventilators. So the Astral and Stellar have some significant constraints in the components that go into those invasive ventilators of the Astral and Stellar type products. Well, Astral is an invasive ventilator and Stellar is actually noninvasive ventilator. But we really don't have significant constraints to the Lumis STA other than some components around the alarms module and the extra components and the AirCurve ST. So those noninvasive ventilators can scale to 5x or 10x, and we can really scale to whatever the demand is. And so then it comes down to our ability to predict hospital-by-hospital, customer-by-customer, what those surges in demand are going to be as the virus moves around the world and to make sure that ResMed is there, getting an order and making sure we can deliver those invasive ventilators, but really importantly, those noninvasive ventilators and alternative therapies that are also used in the different levels of acuity for a patient with COVID-19. So the answer in short is, absolutely. We did all we could, and we tripled production in the quarter, and we are looking to do that and more in Q4 to deliver for the needs that continue worldwide. Lyanne Harrison : Okay. So just to clarify, [indiscernible]. How much can you increase production on the ventilators [indiscernible]. Michael Farrell : I am going to say, Lyanne, the audio wasn't fantastic during that, but I think I heard you say that how would we or how fast would we move from the sort of 3x increases to a 5x or 10x on AirCurve ST, that's going to be dependent upon our modeling of the different surges that happen city-by-city and country-by-country. And clearly, the masks are used far more rapidly because they are changed over pretty regularly certainly patient-to-patient, but often day-to-day with these non-vented ventilation masks. And so we expect the surge to continue and us to continue to be able to produce throughout Q4 and beyond for the needs as this goes -- as this virus goes around the world and continues to expand. Lyanne Harrison : So my question was, how much can we increase the ventilator masks [indiscernible] Michael Farrell : Yes, I've got to say, I can't -- I think I heard you say, can we increase the ventilation mask production? We've increased it tenfold, and we'll continue to do so. I think we should go to the next question. Sorry, Lyanne. Operator : Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Suraj Kalia : I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Mick, just one from my side. And forgive me if you all mentioned this. Can you help characterize your investment in Nyxoah. You all are thinking about the neuromod market specifically for sleep apnea? What is the construct of ResMed's investment? That will be greatly appreciated. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Suraj. It's a great question. And as you know, you followed our stock for a long time. We look at a portfolio of investments to treat sleep apnea. And around 10 years ago, we actually invested in the 3D printing of a sleep apnea dental device called Narval, and that's now a great part of our portfolio and treats a great number of patients in France and across Northern Europe. The neurostimulation market is an interesting one and Nyxoah, we think, is a leader in that space, and we decided to make a minority equity investment in them. I'll actually hand over to Jim Hollingshead, who's the President of our Global Sleep business, to talk about how neurostim, dental, CPAP and how it all fits together. James Hollingshead : Thanks, Mick. Just very briefly, since I know we're probably short on time now. The gold standard therapy for sleep apnea continues to be CPAP therapy. And that -- we think that will continue for the foreseeable future. We get a chance to see a wide range of technologies as they emerge. And we always look very carefully at anything we think is an alternative. And as Mick mentioned, we obviously have a fantastic oral device, which we sell in Europe very successfully. The Narval device, high-tech, 3D printed, very low volume of the mouth, very comfortable. We've looked at the neurostim space for quite a long time. There have been a number of companies that have tried to succeed in the neurostim space. We think Nyxoah has a novel offer and is potentially disruptive, but it's very early days. It's a minority investment in what's effectively a start-up company. So we like the technology. We like to play, but we'll have to see how it plays out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs. Chris Cooper : Mick, can you just remind us of the approximate payer mix in the sleep apnea business, please? And I appreciate this is a highly dynamic situation, but can you just share your thoughts on how you expect the higher rates of unemployment we're seeing in the U.S. to impact that business, please? Michael Farrell : Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. And yes, certainly, every country around the world is different. I presume you're asking about the U.S. payer mix, Chris? Maybe you're on mute, but I'll start with the U.S. Chris Cooper : Okay, primarily, year-on-year. Michael Farrell : Okay. So obviously, we sell in 140 countries outside the U.S. and on the reimbursed part of our business, the non-SaaS part, it's close to that 60-40 range, 60% being within the U.S. and 40% being beyond that. And if you include SaaS businesses, it's more like 65% of our global business in the U.S. So I'll start with that. So we don't have contracts directly with payers, but our portfolio of home medical equipment customers do. And there's around 5,000 customers in the U.S home medical equipment providers, and their payer mix for the field of sleep apnea and COPD that we serve is around 20%, maybe 25% for some regions, Medicare; and around 75%, 80%, private pay.  And as we've seen through the COVID-19 crisis, we have seen ongoing payments from the -- both the government and private payers through to ResMed. We are carefully watching our accounts receivable. And as Brett said, we're carefully watching our cash flow to make sure that payers pay on time and with time, but we haven't seen any issues as yet. Clearly, unemployment has increased in the country from single digits to double digits through this crisis, and it's something that all companies are looking at very carefully. But we haven't seen any issues as yet, but we are watching the cash flow very carefully to make sure that we have continuing flow of capital and cash through our business. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Michael Matson : So I guess first, I just wanted to ask about the resupply business. Wondering why you think that, that's been so strong? Is there any kind of demand pull forward happening there? Do you think that can be sustained as long as the pandemic continues? Michael Farrell : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And certainly, there's -- it's quite interesting. As you know, you've followed us for a long time, too, Mike. Our installed base of CPAP patients, sleep apnea patients is a very strong part of our mask business. We're talking north of 80-plus percent of our masks sales across the U.S. are to that installed base, the diagnosed patient who loves their therapies, changed their life and they're going to go and reorder every time. I think the focus of COVID-19, and that it's a respiratory medical issue and that has raised the importance of making sure that your lungs are well taken care of and that you breathe well and your overall health is well, has increased people to make sure they get their prescriptions for everything, including heart attack. Post heart attack patients are getting more prescription pills. As I noted earlier, the Propeller side, COPD medicines and asthma medicines, we're seeing increased use of those in respiratory medical health. And we've seen a similar thing, I think, in the CPAP mask side, where when you are capable of getting a mask, you are more likely to click, yes, I would like that. And we haven't seen any reduction in people saying, \"Oh the co-pay is too high or I don't want to go there.\" We've seen actually the reverse where people are saying, \"wow, it's been 90 days, I'm due for a therapy, for a CPAP mask, tubing, et cetera.\" And they're clicking yes, and they're getting those devices delivered to them. So very strong ballast in the boat for our HME customers. And the HME customers themselves are really focusing on this part of their business because it's a good opportunity for them. We think -- look, there will be some deceleration if there is some sort of that surge of the sort of the toilet paper model where I'm going to over inventory, you all going to make sure I've got enough masks. That might decelerate somewhat, but we don't think -- we think there's a lot of ballast in that. And people who are on CPAP therapy and loving the CPAP therapy are going to want to get new masks. And through COVID and beyond, the importance of respiratory medicine will only be increased because of this. So we think that part of that business is very steady through the crisis and even stronger beyond. I think it will change behaviors that will last well beyond COVID-19 surge. Michael Matson : Okay. And then just with regard to sleep diagnostic testing. Can you provide any more detail around the declines that you're seeing kind of late in the March quarter? And then to what degree could increased use of home testing kind of some sort of remote telemedicine model offset that? And are you doing anything to try to enable the CPAPs to implement -- to ramp up, I guess, their home sleep testing? Michael Farrell : Yes. Great follow-up question, Mike. And we're doing a lot in that space. I'm focused a lot with Rob Douglas on our global task force on COVID-19 and ventilators. Jim Hollingshead, at the same time, has been running our sleep business strongly. Jim, do you want to follow up on the -- follow-up there on home sleep apnea testing and scale? James Hollingshead : Sure. Thanks, Mick. I think it's very difficult to quantify the effects and the balances of decline in in-lab testing and increase of home sleep testing in general. And it's very different country by country, both because of the timing of the pandemic and then how different health care systems are structured and so on. So trying to get a quantification, I think, is quite difficult. What we do know is we have seen some decline in in-lab testing. That's not a surprise. Health care systems around the world have shifted their focus to COVID-19. Many countries have gone in lockdown. Much of the U.S. has gone in lockdown. So we know that in-lab testing has declined and dipped.  We have some evidence to suggest it stabilized at a lower level. It's hard to know exactly what that level is, but we think it's potentially stabilized at this point. But in parallel, we also know there's been an increase in home sleep testing and remote testing. A number of the labs around the U.S. have increased their use of home sleep testing devices and routines. And where that's done in Europe and can be down in Europe, it continues to be done, and we think it will turn on faster in Europe. And then the final point of your question is what are we doing? We're actually working very hard to enable home sleep testing to figure out how to help our lab customers and our physician customers virtualize their model, not just to our device offerings, but through workflows, through webinars and trainings, and we're working hard to see if we can virtualize some of that with software, which will take a little bit more time. And we do think that a shift to home sleep testing is, which has been going on worldwide for years, will be accelerated by this.  And just as Mick said in his prepared comments, one of the things that we think will come out of the crisis generally for the sleep business is increased adoption of our already very broad offerings, virtualized care offerings. And so we think that will accelerate through the crisis and then have a new normal coming out of the crisis. Operator : Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Malgorzata Kaczor : Just wanted to follow up on the comment you guys have on production of NIVs and LSVs. I think I heard you guys say you've produced 52,000 of those devices in the quarter, which I know you guys don't give ASPs, but it seems like it could be $200 million or $300 million worth of products in the device side versus the $35 million benefit you saw in the quarter. So I guess, long and short, but the question is, were those made-to-order or in advance of demand? And how should we think about that product entering the field? Michael Farrell : Margaret, that's a great question. And yes, certainly, we did -- you heard correctly. We made 52,000 noninvasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. So that includes everything across the Astral, Stellar, Lumis, Flexo, GA and AirCurve, all those devices. So we included across all that group, 52,000, and they have very different pricing. But clearly, it's a lot more than just the $35 million of sales in that quarter. So we are prepared for demand ahead. The only thing I'm really willing to say on a public call like this is that we have a public capability with the U.S. government through HHS and FEMA of over $30 million contract. And so that's a fixed contract that we will fulfill, mostly in Astrals.  And -- but we have many other contracts with hospitals, states, governments, nations around the world. I'm not going to go in and quantify any of those. They're usually one to one directly to those countries and directly to those hospitals. But what I can tell you is all the demand that they have and all the supply that we have, our supplies just cannot keep up with the demand as it moves around the world. And so what we're doing is maximizing production in advance and then making sure we get through the peak and through the surge, but not have an over amount of inventory at the other side. And so we're carefully managing the peak, the surge, the flattening and then making sure we get back to normal COPD, neuromuscular disease, ALS and other sales with those ventilators because those patients will be there beyond. And that's how we're looking at it, Margaret. But yes, clearly, we are preparing for more sales in the future of those ventilators and ventilation masks. That -- those tailwinds will last through Q4 and likely beyond. James Hollingshead : Yes. I'll just add quickly, Mick. Margaret, yes, there's a lot -- there's a meaningful amount that's in transit mode so to speak, as we're trying to get those into our DCs and then ultimately to customers. So there's that -- that impacts it as well. So -- but we'll continue to produce. And as Mick said, the demand is there. It's just a matter of getting it through the logistics. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners. Steven Wheen : I just had a question on the FDA in terms of its response to COVID-19. It was alluding to the use of CPAP as being something that could be utilized. Just wondered what the experience was there? And then the other item that the FDA had done was to remove ventilators from the competitive bidding process. I just -- and there has -- appears to be some pressure to delay competitive bidding in the latest round. Just any comments on any of those 3 things would be very useful. Michael Farrell : Yes, Steve, those are great questions. And I've had actually quite a lot of conference calls with the FDA commissioner, Hahn; and HHS secretary, Azar, during this crisis. ResMed was part of a Defense Production Act that was put in place by the White House to secure component supply for our ventilator so that we could supply HHS, FEMA and beyond. And so I had a lot of interaction there. Look, the FDA have really been a great partner through this process. They helped us get Emergency Use Authorization, EUA, for a number of our products to be used in different context. So for instance, our noninvasive ventilators, which were very scalable. And as we talked about, we made tens of thousands this quarter. We had doctors wanting to use them in various ways, invasive ways and others. And so the doctors needed an EUA to be able to do that, and they have got that. And the FDA were very quick to us and other manufacturers in providing those Emergency Use Authorizations. Simultaneously, Secretary, Azar, over at Health and Human Services and CMS, they did take noninvasive ventilators out of competitive bidding around 2021, and that was a very good change for our HME customers. It really took a load off for them knowing that these NIV and ventilation businesses will be good ongoing concerns for them. So we saw a good partnership from both the FDA and HHS as part of this crisis. And HHS also worked with FEMA to make sure that we got the demand, and that was the $30-plus million contract I talked about to us, and there were 5 other manufacturers who got contracts as well. I think the government, not just in the U.S., but in all 100-plus countries that we're working with through this crisis, have done a great job in contacting us, working with us, helping us with supply chains and helping us with delivery of ventilators to people in the need for this crisis. Steven Wheen : And sorry, the final part was just the pressure that's being or the attempt to delay competitive bidding, the likelihood of that? Michael Farrell : Yes. I'll hand that over to Dave. He's got more insight on that, David Pendarvis? David Pendarvis : Yes. So thanks, Steve. We, along with the rest of the industry, have been suggesting to CMS that they either delay for a year the introduction of the 2021 round entirely or at least the respiratory offerings, respiratory product codes within that offering of the 2021 round of competitive bidding. We have had a dialogue with CMS on that topic, so they are listening. But I can't really handicap the likelihood that it will happen or not. I would echo what Mick said earlier, that CMS has been very responsive, and I think it has highlighted the importance of DME and home-based care in ensuring that as few people are in the hospital is not. And that's a real positive. And we hope that, that cooperative working relationship will continue. Operator : Our next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan. David Low : Mick, can I just follow-up on the use of bilevel device to treat COVID-19 patients. I mean there's clearly the aerosol issue and the safety issue there. I have seen some efforts to overcome that. Do you think that's going to be on -- I mean -- and I heard your comments, excuse me, about the amount of manufacturing capacity you have. Is your expectation that there will be continued strong demand for that utilization model? Michael Farrell : Yes. Look, it's a great question, David. And certainly, through this crisis, one of the leading countries early on this was the U.K. and the National Institute -- the National Health Service there, the NHS. And they created a protocol, which looked at the various acuity levels of COVID-19 patient because the disease -- the coronavirus gets into the lungs and then causes the COVID-19 disease, which is where mucus builds up as the alveoli react and try to fight off the virus, and it creates mucus in the lungs and builds it up. And so at different levels of buildup, different levels of acuity, different therapies are needed. And so the NHS created a very strong protocol of using both CPAP with some supplemental oxygen from the wall as well as bilevel therapy and then upgrading to more aggressive noninvasive ventilation therapy because bilevel is noninvasive positive pressure ventilation therapy. But then upgrading to higher levels of noninvasive ventilation therapy and even upgrading all the way to the full intubation through the trachea of invasive mechanical ventilation. And all those different modes can be moved up and down by the doctor as they move through the process.  Your question about -- and it was a big question and concern early on that, oh, gosh, what if we have some contagion that some of the COVID-19 will come out? Well, before you put on an invasive mechanical ventilator, if a patient coughs or sneezes, the room is already contaminated. So even with invasive inhalation, there are some contamination protocols. And so what you need is a COVID-19 ward, you need PPE for everybody and you need to establish this floor of the hospital is for COVID-19 with negative pressure and take care of it that way. And that's what they've done in the U.K.. And actually, that moved to different parts of New York, New Jersey. And as we see this go around the world, people are learning to do that. What you have is a non-vented mask, so a ventilation mask with an inlet and outlet and then a filter on the outlet of the device. And so our Chief Medical Officer, Carlos -- Dr. Carlos Nunez, has been working with key opinion leaders worldwide, and we have a clinical white paper with best practice from Wuhan, from Milan, from London, from Munich, but they're doing it really well in Germany and from New York and around the world. And that protocol does include CPAP, it does include bilevel, it does include noninvasive ventilation with positive pressure, all with specific masks and specific circuit set up all the way up to invasive mechanical ventilation.  Now the second part of your question, after the crisis will people continue to use more noninvasive ventilation? I think the answer is yes. I think it's going to be similar to digital health, where we've had to use home sleep apnea testing, you've had to use remote patient monitoring during this crisis. And you don't want to go to a patient's home. You don't want them to have to come to a hospital. And so that's driven digital health. I think people, doctors in critical care units have seen how noninvasive ventilation, including bilevel has very well treated patients with COVID-19, why can't it very well treat COPD patients? Well, guess what? It can. So I think the adoption of NIV will increase post COVID-19 because of the learnings during COVID-19. I can't quantify that exactly. It's more a medium, long-term thing. But anyway, I hope that answers your question, David. It's a very good one. It deserves a longer answer. And I know we're 10 minutes over, we might just take two more questions and let everyone get back to their work day, 3 more questions. Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Matthew Mishan : And also it's really remarkable, the efforts of you and the employees of your company to support this crisis. So thank you for that as well. I'll just leave it to 1 because most of my questions have been asked. I've heard that there's potentially long-term respiratory implications from COVID-19 exposure. How do you see that patient transition to post-acute? Michael Farrell : Yes, it's a great question, Matthew. I'll hand that to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rob, to talk about post COVID-19 discharge. What are the next steps, Rob? Robert Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Matthew. That's a good question. It's still an uncertain world in terms of what these post protocols are going to be across the board. We're seeing different trials and tests being carried out. In some areas, we are seeing patients get discharged with oxygen, and we are noticing an uptick in demand for oxygen around the place. And in other areas, we are seeing some discharges with more CPAP. But I think it's still way too early to say, probably the earliest data we've got is in China where things are normalizing a little bit. The sleep labs aren't yet open, but we're seeing continued ongoing demand for longer-term ventilation. So it's probably leading off the dynamic, that Mick mentioned earlier, that ventilation is noninvasive ventilation and chronic ventilation is recognized as a more relevant treatment than what it had been before. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Sean Laaman : Well done, Mick, clearly doing a great job navigating. Sorry if I've missed it, but my question is, the $35 million of COVID revenue, was there any geographic sort of breakup of that? And just to clarify, what's that all vent revenue? Michael Farrell : Sean, that's a great question. Not comfortable going into details of where the $35 million came from. That's sort of our global number. And it's truly an estimate. It's -- the vast majority of it is ventilation. And so it's Astrals, Stellars, Lumis, AirCurve ST types of products. I'll hand over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO, to see if he wants to provide any further detail on that $35 million. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. I mean the only -- there is some -- there will be some mask and accessories things in that as well. You'd estimate making -- maybe that accounts for kind of 10% of that number and the rest would be devices. Operator : Your last question comes from Gretel Janu with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Gretel Janu : So you mentioned the double-digit declines in the diagnosis rates in the quarter due to lockdowns. I'm just wondering whether you saw any slowdown in the actual fleet new patient setups in the third quarter? Or will most of that impact from the slower sleep diagnosis impact the fourth quarter? Michael Farrell : Yes, Gretel, thanks a lot. Look, as you can understand, there's a lot of moving pieces going on right at the moment, and we're watching it through the quarter. And in different countries, and even in some countries in the world, we've seen that decline. Like in China, we saw that decline in January, February, and we're actually starting to pick up on the rates as we started to exit the quarter, and some regions of China starting to open up and then diagnosis is starting to open up again. But -- and similarly in South Korea and some other areas that have COVID-19 under control now. But I'll hand over to Jim Hollingshead to see if he wants to provide any further details the sort of kinetics of the double-digit reduction in diagnostics and any impact on sort of that headwind, I guess, of sleep device sales, while we have the neutral element of sleep masks continuing through. Jim? James Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Gretel. With a little bit of a lag, you can also see bit of a drop-off in new patient starts, which we have the ability through our connected solutions to see -- as I said before, I think we're seeing diagnosis stabilize a bit, and I expect some countries to start to turn back on in the near term. And we're seeing new patient starts also stabilize a bit. So hopefully, we'll -- hopefully, we get a bounce off of the floor here. It's very difficult to predict what that will look like. It will be different country-by-country and even metro area by metro area. Michael Farrell : Great. Well, thanks for all the questions, and thanks to everyone for continuing the 15 minutes over here. I think we'll all agree this was a very unique quarter for not just ResMed, but for all companies worldwide. Look, I'll go with the close now, I think, here and close on up. I'd like to thank again to all our shareholders who've joined us for this call. I'd also like to shout out again to the 7,500 Resmedians helping people in 140 countries. You guys are also shareholders in the most part, and I want to thank you for your dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital. Thanks for all that you do all day, every day. Thanks, especially to those frontline heroes, the people making the products, distributing the products and getting those vents to those 140 countries to somebody who's suffocating and needs our help. I look forward to talking to all of our stakeholders again here in 90 days. And with that, we'll close it up. Thank you, Diego. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. And just a reminder, if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or to Investor Relations. And as previously mentioned, all the documents, along with the transcript and a replay will be available on our website later today. Thanks, Diego. You can now close the call. Operator : Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Cheryl. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. The call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to go ahead and now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today. During this global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease state that leads to, I hope that you, your family, and your friends remain safe and healthy during these times. Way back in early January, a ResMed employee, a ResMedian in Hubei Province, China, put on a hazmat suit and help set up ventilators to provide the gift of breath to many thousands of people turned out in that city, while their immune systems fought against the first global cases of COVID-19 that ResMed saw in Wuhan. Since that time, seven months ago, our global team has provided vital support globally to combat this coronavirus. Not just across China, but across Asia, then across Europe, across North America, and now we're just starting to prepare and to -- actually we're in the midst of continuing that battle in Latin America, in Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the Middle East and Asia that still have that what we call the peak impact ahead of them in terms of hospitalizations and ventilator needs. So, I noted in our call, 90 days ago, our Q3 call that we would do more to support the global community and local healthcare systems with ventilators and ventilation mask systems across the 140 countries that we serve. During Q4, during this June quarter, we produced around 100,000 invasive and non-invasive ventilators, including bi-level positive pressure ventilators. That brings our cumulative total to over 150,000 ventilators that we produced since the beginning of calendar year 2020. So, we've delivered on our promise to triple our production, and in fact, if you take the period from January 1 to June 30 for 2020, that is a 3.5x increase over the period for 2019, so 3.5x. For our flagship ventilator, which is the Astral life-support ventilator, we reached a peak of over five times our weekly production rates during the period, and we're still running at full capacity for the Astral to ensure that ResMed is there for what we call preservation of life as the coronavirus continues to move around the globe. I'm particularly proud of the role that our supply chain, our manufacturing, our distribution, and our tech services teams have played during this coronavirus crisis, making sure that ResMed device and a complete ventilation system was there at the bedside when someone needed help breathing as their immune system fights against COVID-19. So, looking forward, we have built a sophisticated set of analytic capabilities including an epidemiology patient model that has helped us model the impacts of both the headwinds and the tailwinds that are part of this COVID-19 crisis, and we have detailed scenarios of the impacts by city, by region, by country, and by ResMed business line. Through that analysis, I'm happy to say that we're confident in our ResMed ability to execute across the full range of potential scenarios for all of our customers and for all of our global businesses. The tailwinds for ventilation in the March quarter and the June quarter from both the ventilator devices and the ventilation mask systems are starting to recede, and while we are still working on current and future contracts with hospitals, as well as city and national health authorities for these ventilators, the volumes will be significantly lower in the September quarter for these ventilators. At the same time, the headwinds we experienced especially in the June quarter for our sleep apnea and COPD patient flow and patient diagnosis are also receding. So, people are starting to return for their primary care physician visits, they're starting to return for their specialist physician visits, and we see the system today growing from its nadir during the last period as we now see city-by-city and country-by-country the markets are coming back online. So, over the portfolio of 140 countries that we serve, we expect a gradual sequential quarter-to-quarter U-shaped recovery of patient flow to primary care physician, sleep physicians, as well as pulmonary physicians that are treating COPD and asthma throughout fiscal year 2021. We expect the expansion of home sleep apnea testing to continue as it did during the crisis, we think it will continue post the crisis, and we also expect a steady sort of sequential increase in sleep lab activity and visits to the pulmonary specialists both in person and through Telehealth, which has been expanding rapidly under COVID. Additionally, some very early research into the post-COVID clinical world shows that select patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may have lung damage, and some of them may require long-term ventilator support. This is an additional area of focus for us, but I have to say, it's very early days in that area. In my prepared remarks today, I will provide some insights into our Q4 and our full fiscal year 2020 business performance. I'll also recap our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy, and some execution highlights against some of our key operating priorities as part of that strategy. Finally, I'll discuss how we're advancing and learning in a post-COVID peak world, including how this pandemic has accelerated three important trends; one, the importance of respiratory medicine; two, the importance of digital health; and three, the importance of outside hospital healthcare. These are three key elements of our ResMed 2025 strategies that were in play well before the global pandemic, but these are three trends that have accelerated during this pandemic, and we think the momentum will continue in a post-COVID world. So, for our business performance, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2020. We had year-on-year annual 15% top line revenue growth to $3 billion in annual revenue for ResMed. Our results reflect strong growth and positive momentum across our innovative MedTech portfolio and our market-leading digital health software solutions. We have grown our global market footprint finding new patients in the midst of a global pandemic, and we have driven growth with recurring revenue from our installed base of sleep apnea patients. While our financial results in March and June have benefited from high demand for ventilation devices and lower operating costs, our underlying core business of sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma remains strong and well-positioned for long-term growth. During fiscal year 2020, we generated $802 million of cash that allowed us to return $225 million of cash dividends to you, our shareholders, while also investing in our future with a double-digit increase in R&D, including clinical research, both digital and in-person, as well as design and digital innovation across our sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and our software-as-a-service businesses. We have a full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term growth opportunities with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs. Importantly, we have also seen significant growth in our digital health ecosystem. We now have over 6.5 billion nights of sleep and respiratory medical data in the Air Solutions platform. We have grown connectivity to our digital health ecosystem by over 26% this fiscal year, and we now have over 12 million, 100% Cloud connectable medical devices in the market, and we have around 14 million patients enrolled in the AirView software solution. Our digital health ecosystem is a competitive advantage for ResMed that offers innovative solutions, as well as integrated care to drive superior outcomes, better patient experiences, and lower healthcare system costs. Our acquisition and continued investment and development of the Propeller platform, has been a digital health accelerant for ResMed. Our recently-announced commercial partnership with Novartis, which I will describe in more detail later during the call, is a great example of this progress with Propeller. During the last 12 months, we have improved 16 million lives by providing a person with a device or complete mask system to help them breathe. Importantly, the ability to help these patients on their individual journey to better sleep and better breathing is powered by over 6.5 billion nights of medical data in our ecosystem. These data form a significant competitive advantage as they enable us to perform sophisticated analytics, and drive actionable insights to benefit all their customer groups, including the patients, most importantly, but also in improving workflows for physicians, for providers, for payers, and for full healthcare systems. Fundamentally, we believe the future of healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where we win today. Globally, there are 936 million people with sleep apnea. There are over 380 million people, who suffer from COPD, and there are over 340 million people living with asthma, they all need our help. And they all want that help at home, definitely not in a hospital. Our SaaS business is 100% focused on out-of-hospital care le2veraging the global trend for seniors to age in place, we think this trend will accelerate in a post-COVID world. ResMed can provide seamless care for our portfolio of out of hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technologies, the recognition of the value of remote monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the evolution of global reimbursement models in the field of digital health. This acceleration of digital health adoption represents a significant medium to long-term tailwind for our business. These three trends, the increased importance of respiratory medicine, the increased importance of digital health, and the increased importance of out of hospital health care, will help ResMed achieve our goal to improve 250 million lives by 2025. So, on to our operating priorities, we have three operating priorities that guide our daily focus here at ResMed, number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. With over 1.6 billion people across these three chronic disease states, we know that delivering our innovative solutions to these under penetrated markets is actually a number one priority; and number two priority is to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as digital health technology solutions to better engage physicians, providers and payers as well as patients, so that we can improve clinical outcomes so we can reduce costs, and we can enhance the patient experience; and number three priority is to innovate and grow the world's best seamless software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital. We think ResMed is uniquely positioned to deliver on these three priorities. So, I'll quickly walk through some examples of innovation in each of these priorities, and then will hand over to Brett and go to Q&A. In our core market of sleep apnea, we launched what we call the ResMed MaskSelector into our U.S. geography. The ResMed MaskSelector is a digital health technology to make remote patient mask selection and sizing both easier and more effective, helping the patient themselves receive the care they need from home. We think that this is the digital solution to help our HME medical equipment or HME customers in their challenge to find the right mask for each patient when they can't physically touch them due to physical distancing during COVID-19. We are providing this solution at no charge during the coronavirus public health emergency. However, we think this technology's efficiency and benefits for both providers and patients will last well beyond the pandemic. Digital tools like this as well as capabilities including video support for doctors and their patients, as well as remote mask patient fittings have seen good application during COVID-19 combined without mask resupply solutions, including SnapWorx, [Oracle], [ph] and Brightree ReSupply. We have delivered solid mass growth. In terms of new patient flow, the COVID lockdowns have had a significant impact on our business. We saw double-digit declines in new sleep apnea patient flow across all markets that experienced lockdowns, individual cities, regions and countries had unique approaches to any lockdown and reopening processes. For instance, today in Germany, we stand at more than 85% of pre-COVID sleep lab capacity already up and running, whereas in China, the other end of the spectrum, we stand at 50% of pre-COVID diagnostic capacity in that geography; most of the other 140 countries that we sell into around the world fall somewhere between those two extremes. In big countries like the U.S., it's a story of 50 states with unique models, again as a spectrum between these boundary conditions. The average in the United States is probably somewhere in that 70% of diagnostic capability, but some states will be closer to the 60% range, and some will be closer to the 75% range. As I stated earlier, we expect a steady sequential quarter-by-quarter sort of U-shaped recovery of the sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma patient flow throughout fiscal 2021. Clearly, a highly effective vaccine or a highly efficacious treatment for COVID-19 could of course turn that U-shaped into a dramatic V-shaped recovery. However, we're not counting on that and an event like that remains upside from what we call our expected or likely case scenario. In terms of execution in our second key disease, state of COPD and our ventilation solutions for COPD, and other lung conditions, we launched our cloud-based remote monitoring software called AirView for our ventilator solution in Europe, including the Astral product, the Stellar ventilator, and the Lumis ventilator. Through AirView, clinicians and care providers can now remotely monitor their patient's respiratory rate, as well as their blood oxygen saturation. These are two critical indicators for a respiratory patient's condition. We accelerate the delivery of this technology for clear and urgent needs during the pandemic. However, this enhanced AirView capability providing insights across European ventilation patient populations will provide differentiation for ResMed through the clinical value for positions and better outcome for patients in perpetuity. In terms of execution in our third key disease state of asthma ResMed has partnered with Novartis to co-package the Propeller solution and digital platform with the new triple action asthma medication in a brand called Enerzair Breezhaler. This novel combination has been cleared by the European Commission for launch. The Propeller sensor attaches to the new inhaler from Novartis, and its new medication, where it can collect medication usage data. The app works both as an adherence measure that gives the patient reminders to take the medication, but also as a means of collecting information about the patient's medical condition to help their physician provide even better care to the patient. This is a breakthrough innovation as it is the first time a respiratory medicine has been co-packaged with a digital health platform and co-prescribed. The benefits of this combination are tremendous for the patient. It's a simple and convenient way to have a fully integrated experience to allow them to better live with their chronic disease to better live with asthma, with no incremental cost to the patient. This brand-new approval is a new to the world technology that will accelerate the adoption of digital health in the respiratory medicine space, and will help us identify other innovative opportunities to combine our Propeller tech with medicine delivery. This new Novartis partnership follows our announcement in May that the Propeller sensor and an apps gained 510(k) U.S. 510(k) clearance for use with the Symbicort inhaler for both asthma and COPD patients from AstraZeneca. This sensor is built to fit various inhalers and the generic equivalents. Propeller's cloud-based system tracks medication usage of the Symbicort from these inhalers through a smartphone app, which patients can use to paint a clearer picture of their disease control for their clinicians. These new partnerships with both Novartis and AstraZeneca, and previously-announced collaborations with Ryan, as well as Boehringer Ingelheim expand the potential reach of Propeller's technology to around 90% of inhaled medicines for both asthma and COPD in the United States. We believe that this represents a significant upside opportunity for the expansion of the Propeller platform in the U.S. market, but also around the world as the benefits of digital health grow and move around the world. So, before I transition to details of our software-as-a-service business, I'd like to recap briefly why the SAAS business is integral to ResMed's long-term strategy to provide seamless transitions between hospital care and post acute care, or as we call it here at ResMed out-of-hospital care, because we don't think you have to go to hospital to get good care outside the hospital. Our vision is to enable a system where a patient's health data moves with him as they transition care settings, giving providers the information they need to deliver personalized care and saving the person and the caregiver both time and money. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only long-term strategic player with solutions that span across these seven important out-of-hospital, healthcare verticals. Home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew 7% compared to the year ago period. We are integrating and optimizing the out-of-hospital SAAS portfolio to support long-term growth. We continue to believe that the long-term weighted average growth of these SAAS verticals that we're in is in the high single digits. The COVID-19 market impact has particularly affected the skilled nursing facility census levels and that vertical that we serve. We believe this impact will continue over the next several quarters, moving the weighted average market growth of these verticals to the mid single digit range for our SAAS businesses for that period with return to high single digits as we start to see other analogous things such as elective surgeries and hospital discharges return to their normal rates at which time we believe that that market's weighted average market growth rate will return to the high single digits. Our goal here at ResMed is always to not just meet, but to beat that market growth through delivery of superior market leading solutions. Turning to more details of our SAAS business performance during the quarter, we've been pleased with the early impact of SnapWorx Technology, which we acquired in February. As we discussed on our last earnings call, SnapWorx provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply for our HME customers. The timing of this acquisition couldn't have been better with COVID-19. Our HME customers have been increasingly focused on resupply and better tech to interact with patients in a no touch non-contact world. The combination of SnapWorx as well as Oracle, and Brightree ReSupply, and all of these three technologies are under our Brightree brand, they provide the strongest suite of resupply solutions available in the market period. This technology is important to our customers to their patients as well as to our internal SAAS business and our core sleep apnea business, driving both patient engagement and better outcomes as well as revenue growth. In October 2019, we announced that ResMed entered into an agreement with Cerner Corporation to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions, control costs, and deliver seamless care across healthcare systems. We have now integrated our Brightree branded home health and hospice platform with the Cerner Electronic Health Record, or EHR. This partnership is performing above our expectations for both Cerner and for ResMed and we anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration as we continue to work together. In summary, the SaaS portfolio is performing well and reminds an important driver of our digital transformation of healthcare in settings outside the hospital. The COVID headwinds in the near-term will recede, and we will continue to invest now and in the future in research and development, to make sure ResMed has the best solutions for long-term growth and market leadership. The future healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. COVID-19 has accelerated that, and we here at ResMed are well positioned to capitalize on. Our diversified solution portfolio and capabilities are related against the compelling and expanding market opportunity in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and out-of-hospital SaaS. Through the first seven months of this COVID-19 crisis and this calendar year, we've maintained strong growth through our effective execution, our right to innovation, our recurring revenue businesses, as well as margin expansion driven by our global operating excellence programs. While we look forward to moving COVID-19 into the rearview mirror, there are beneficial trends, it has accelerated, which are now passing more over their actually persistent and we believe impactful. The importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of digital health and the importance of healthcare delivered outside the hospital. Those three trends just go accelerated and they're here to stay. While these macro trends have increased Telehealth and increased remote patient monitoring represent short, medium, and long-term benefits the ResMed's business. More importantly, they represent tailwinds for significant improvement on the most critical patient metrics, improving clinical outcomes for the patient's chronic disease and enhancing levels of patient satisfaction for that ultimate customer. The person who just wants to sleep better, breath better, and live with a better quality of life. So before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to express my personal gratitude to the 7,500, ResMedians around the world. In an unprecedented fiscal year, you have remained focused on creating value in our core markets and honoring commitments to patients through COVID-19, you helped us pivot and produce 150,000 lifesaving ventilators to help people breathe in 140 countries worldwide. Without our team, our current and future success would not be possible. So thank you to you to all of you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : All right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, we will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and some remarks on our Q1 FY '21, outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $770 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%, compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the fourth quarter were favorably impacted by significant sales of ventilated devices and accessories, partially offset by declines in our sleep business. We estimated the incremental net revenue benefit from COVID-19 related impacts within the order of $20 million. Reflecting estimated incremental ventilator and related accessory revenue of $125 million partially offset by an estimated $105 million impact on our sleep revenue, relative to our pre-COVID forecasts. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business. Our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $401 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets, total $278 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter and an increase of 22% in constant currency terms. Byproduct segment U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $206 million, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Mask and other sales were $195 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia, and other markets device sales total $206 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 35% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $73 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior quarter or in constant currency terms, a 6% decrease. Globally in currency terms device sale increased by 16% while mask and other sales increased by 3% over prior year quarter. Software as a Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $91 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis SaaS revenue increased by 6%. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted impacted amortization of acquired intangibles the purchase accounting, fair value adjustments and matrixcare deferred revenue, restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings, press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points to 59.9% in the June quarter, compared to 59.3% in the same quarter last year, the increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix partially offset by increased costs in logistics, component parts and manufacturing. These cost increases largely reflect the impact of COVID-19 in our rapid ramp up and ventilator production. In particular, we incurred significantly higher inbound and outbound air freight costs during the quarter, reflecting both higher volumes and significantly higher rates. We are rebalancing air freight and sea freight volumes, but in the meantime, we expect to see elevated freight costs continue into Q1 FY '21. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $165 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. We're in constant currency terms SG&A expenses were consistent with the prior year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.5%, compared to the 24.3%, we reported in the prior quarter benefiting from cost management and reduce travel as we work through the uncertain COVID-19 environment. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses to increase in the low single digits relative to the year ago period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $53 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue with 6.8%, compared to 7.3% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize investments in innovation, because we believe our long-term commitment to technology and product development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow in the high single-digits to low double-digits, reflecting, our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles. Total amortization of acquired intangibles is $20 million for the quarter, a decrease of 14% over the prior quarter, reflecting historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $243 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin, and well managed operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 16.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.8%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $193 million, an increase of 40% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.22. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $330 million reflecting robust underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, WE also paid dividends of $56 million. We recorded equity losses of $6 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with a fairly joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $15 million for the full fiscal year 2021 associated with the joint venture operations. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $463 million, having generated $330 million in operating cash flow during the fourth quarter and $802 million during our fiscal year 2020. At June 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $717 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest in the June 30, we had just under $1.1 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remained strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are currently managing expenses cash flow, and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence and our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Finally, to recap on Q4 results, our earnings this quarter were very strong reflecting significant demand for ventilators, underpinning revenue growth and expansion in our gross margin and lower operating expenses. Turning now to our first quarter of FY 2021 outlook, at a high level, we expect to see continued demand for ventilators but at a significantly lower level compared to Q4 FY 2020. Additionally, we expect to see continued headwinds for sleep device sales in Q1 in response to the temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience over the past three months which reflects the insulating value of the large patient installed base. Consistent with these remarks for the first month of Q1 FY 2021, we recorded group revenue growth in the low single digits. However, like many other companies, we're experiencing pervasive uncertainty in the current environment. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question and if you have follow-ups or additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue. Cheryl, we're now ready to start the Q&A portion. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Saul Hadassin : Thank you. Good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. Just a question for me; Mick, just some color around the rest of the world growth rate, the disparity between device sales at a very strong 35% benchmark at negative 6%, can you just talk to ventilation and how that impacted there and whether there was anything else to read into that mask growth rate, please? Mick Farrell : Yes. So, thanks for the question, and yes, clearly now Europe -- you know, that is Europe, Asia, and rest of world, so it's the whole world apart from the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, clearly incredibly strong year-on-year growth in the devices side primarily driven on the upside by the ventilator sales, and so, these were, you know, we've had talked about contracts with national governments in the U.K., France, Germany for ventilator sales that were delivered during that June quarter and others around Asia and rest of world. So, that's been the sort of this tailwind if you like from COVID-19, and the headwinds, there were pretty dramatic shutdowns that we saw certainly in Western Europe and most parts of Southeast Asia, including China, which is still at 50% of its fleet capacity today, and that severely slowed down first time set up of patients, but in those geographies, the sort of resupply technology that I talked about in the prepared remarks like SnapWorx, [Oracle] [ph], and Brightree ReSupply, those are all U.S. based technologies, and we really haven't put those technology into play in those European markets. There's an opportunity to do that in the future, but they are not there and they don't have the same resiliency around those mask sales. So, that sort of it's almost like a tale of two markets, if you like, on the devices versus masks during that Q4 for Europe, Asia, and rest of world. Saul Hadassin : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall : Thanks very much for taking my question. Just trying to understand the sequencing, I guess across the next few quarters, just as you sort of see the decline in vents and your regular CPAP business returning. I know you've talked to us, but just any sort of metrics, I know where you -- anything around production or anything like that, that might give us a bit of a sense of sort of how that's going to sequence over the next few quarters? Mick Farrell : Yes, Andrew, this is a question that macroeconomics around the world are working on in every industry, when are we going to see as these lockdowns turn to openings and every city, every country, that we're operating in has different metrics on how fast they're opening and where they're opening. Some never closed, like Sweden. Some are opening really well like Germany, and some are going to second size shutdowns like China. And so, the best we can see as we model it, and we've got a lot of scenarios for the next fiscal year, but the best we can see is across that portfolio of 140 countries we see a sequential sort of U-shaped recovery where we start with Q1, and then we build up to Q2, Q3, Q4 through the fiscal year, as we start to see these reopening happen. We're going to expect second waves and third waves and fourth waves and the sort of W's within a particular city or particular state, but across the country level and certainly at the 140 country portfolio level, we expect that to be a U-shaped recovery, in our likely case throughout the fiscal year, and so, it all sort of turn to a world where we look at sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and then from Q2 to Q3, and Q3 to Q4, and that's how we're sort of modeling the recovery of our sleep apnea, our COPD, and our asthma patient flow, and therefore that part of our business. There will be resiliency in the mask resupply, particularly in the U.S. geography and some other buffers that we have around our SaaS business, but that's sort of how we're looking at it on a macro basis. Andrew Goodsall : Would you expect to return to normal by FY'22 or close to normal? Mick Farrell : Again, Andrew, I would be a great macro economist working for a large multinational bank to make a prediction like this, and they're often wrong when they make those predictions. I think it's very difficult to say when exactly we will be back to the pre-COVID times. I did see a presentation from a global bank economist, who talked about 12 months, 24 months return to normal type period; very difficult to know. Health care, we're more resilient, people as opposed to going to retail to get a new automobile, or a new sound system, or a new home repair, they are going to their primary care physicians and their elective surgeries much quicker, and you can look on those two metrics which are pretty well-published in the major geographies, so PCP visits, GP visits, and for elective surgeries and hospital visits, and we're starting to see those metrics tick-up on a week-to-week basis. And so, the other types of analogs that we're watching and looking at, and then all the other parts come into play. Obviously, there's the upside as I talked about in the prep remarks, if there's an effective vaccine or an effective treatments to COVID-19, all bets are off, this goes to the V-shaped recovery in the markets as they get vaccinal treatment, but we've got a likely expected case of a U throughout the fiscal year, and then get back to that normal in that sort of 12 to 24-month time period. Andrew Goodsall : Fantastic. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Malgorzata Kaczor of William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Brandon on for Margaret. I just wanted to go back to the vents really quick. You'd mentioned that you manufactured another 100,000 vents that can be used within the hospital. Have you sold most of these, or any of these, and is this kind of a similar situation with the prior 50,000 that they are maybe lined up for contracts already that could be recognized in the next quarter? And I'm just -- part of that is just trying to understand where vent demand is going to end-up especially since you had mentioned that Astral is still being made at full capacity, but you're expecting a steep drop-off in the next quarter. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes, Brandon, thanks for the question. Yes, certainly we're very proud of the 150,000 ventilators that we made during the first-half of the calendar year; the second-half of our fiscal year. As you know that's a very small percentage of compared to the sleep apnea devices, which are more in the sort of 2, 2.5 million on an annualized basis devices that we make across the CPAPs, IPAPs and the sleep apnea bi-levels, but look, we did obviously sell as we talked about, and Brett talked about in his remarks, we had an extra $35 million of sales in the March quarter at Q3 from ventilator, ventilator masks, and we had an extra $125 million in ventilator and ventilator mask sales in the fourth quarter, and we're not going to predict exactly what that will be here in the September quarter. We're working on hospitals, state and national bidding processes but I can tell you that the volume of bidding and the volume of processes in the sort of expected likely case of that is significantly lower here in the September quarter for that, so that that demand has gone down a lot. I mean, it's ironic in some ways, because the populations of the regions that are now impacted Brazil, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, you add up these countries and you start to get to the billions of people, I would like to see demand significantly higher, because I think humanitarian wise, we're going to need more ventilators. We have the production ready, and we are working on contracts where they're there, but we can't sell to someone who won't buy, and so as best we can see, there's going to be a pretty significant drop-off here in the September quarter on the ventilators, but at the same time, that means that the economies are opening up on the other side for our fleet business and we start to get that sequential growth back along those lines. Brett, maybe you want to add some more color on that? Brett Sandercock : Yes, the only thing I would add, Mick is there would be consistent with last quarter, there is a portion of that production that remains in inventory at June 30. So that's certainly the case. Well, as Mick said, Astral is still producing still fairly tight, and I think we will continue to do that next little while. Operator : Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Deakin-Bell: Good morning. Thank you. My question was just trying to understand again, just the shape of recovery perhaps look at Europe and the macro wise it looks like some of the European countries have started to recover a little earlier than the U.S. Have you seen anything that could guide you to have the U.S. come out of this in Germany or France or any other countries you have been doing business? Mick Farrell : Yes, John, it's a great question, and actually, we are looking at Germany as sort of a model of not only how to have dealt with the crisis, that country did a really good job of preparing early, they got their ventilator orders in early and they had, they never reached peak capacity in any of the major regions, cities or hospitals, and now as I recover, as I said in the prepared remarks, they north of 85% of the sleep lab capacity, they were behind the COVID Germany on home sleep apnea testing, but it really, they sort of had a leap forward on that, and I think that will move from, it was maybe 5% or 10% of diagnoses in Germany pre-COVID. I think that'll move to a solid double-digit number post-COVID, but Germany is a great model for the recovery, and it's a country right next door there in France had excellent home sleep apnea testing pre-COVID and so I think the recovery will be quite swift in France as well. You can almost look, you're asking for the analogy to the United States. Take those two countries as different regions within the U.S., Germany could be analogous to some of the states in the U.S. like mostly in the Midwest, where there's a lot of sleep apnea tests done in a sleep apnea lab and I think that will take a longer time to get to capacity just because of all the restrictions around COVID the deep cleaning and just people's psychology about turning up to a sleep lab and staying overnight versus some states, maybe like California or Massachusetts or Florida where home sleep apnea testing was more prevalent. Those not only had less of a dip during the crisis because they're able to move their patient flow to home sleep apnea test, we think they may recover faster in the patient volumes in those areas, and so, we certainly are looking at those analogs, and certainly we're sharing a learning internally here at ResMed from our Germany team, the CEO of Germany, Katrin Pucknat, she's a member of my Global CEO Operations team. So her best practices of what they're doing there brought to the global team and Jim Hollingshead and the team on the sleep and respiratory care side, and then driving that through our U.S. market with our great commercial team we have here in the U.S. and beyond, and so I'm quite confident that we're going to see a sequential quarter-to-quarter recovery throughout the fiscal year. I think we've reached the idea here in Q4 of a flow of patients globally and within our major geographies. And we're going to pick those up every quarter as we go through, I do think there's going to be second, or first waves impacting Latin America and Africa and so on. And I do hope that we're able to secure some good ventilator sales into there for now, because that will need them on a humanitarian basis, but then they will recover a little later in those geographies, but I'm pretty comfortable of our plan, likely case scenario of a steady sequential recovery, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 throughout the fiscal year, assuming no vaccine, no treatment, if those happen, it could be a significant one where you start talking about year-on-year numbers again, versus quarter-on-quarter numbers. John Deakin-Bell: Great color. Thanks, Mick. Operator : Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Bailey : Great, thanks very much. Good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. Just had a question in relation to the U.S. in particular on that commentary around sleep lab capacity, sort of talking to about 70% at the moment, I'm just interested in where you think that might have got to on an average basis over the year, over the June quarter, and then, perhaps any commentary might be I'll provide over that the staging over the quarter in that, you know, it was April the trough, and then improving towards June, just any commentary you can provide there would be would be appreciated? Mick Farrell : Yes, David, it's a really good question, and we actually have some good information around that because we have both, you know the sort of digital end-to-end play on the sleep apnea market where we have apnea link air, which is cloud connected, honestly, that we are testing, all the way through to the obviously the air solutions platform with the air sense devices that are 100% cloud connectable as well, so we see activation rights on that weekly basis, and you picked it, we have seen during the quarter sort of that idea in that sort of late April, early May timeframe, and that we've started to see weekly increases from that idea. You see to the public data around primary care physician visits, and elective surgeries are picking up, and we also see, and without quantifying because that's sort of pretty proprietary data for ResMed, I can certainly say qualitatively to question that offer that idea in, you know, late April, early May, we have seen week-to-week increases on enhanced sleep apnea tests, but also in the activation really importantly as the market leader in market share for sleep apnea devices we're seeing activations increased from that idea point on a weekly basis and so, and we have our geography and you can see all these effects like did this or that city did that, you can see, little W shapes in some of those that have the aggregate, we're seeing that sort of steady U-shaped recovery, even in down to that granular level during the quarter and that's what gives us the confidence as we project forward into a lot of uncertainty in COVID times, 52 weeks seems like a lot of uncertainty that we think there will be that steady across the portfolio steady U-shaped recovery, but I think that's the most color I can provide you there, David. David Bailey : Thanks, Mick. Operator : Your next question is from David Low of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Low : Thanks very much, Mick, if I could keep on the same topic. I mean, you're talking about a U-shaped recovery, just to be really clear and simple here. We're at the bottom of that U, so effectively the first couple of quarters you'd expect, pretty low growth, not so dissimilar to what Brett talked about in terms of the low single-digit growth you're saying in July. Is that what you're saying? Mick Farrell : Yes, exactly, David, that's exactly how I interpret the sort of classic U. So, thank you for clarifying that. David Low : Great, thanks. Mick Farrell : You can have a question as well if you like. David Low : Thanks, Mick. I never want to ask you. I get in so much trouble, but I will pick you up on that. The decline that you saw in CPAP or in devices you talked about a double-digit decline. I think we had that yesterday talk about a 30% drop in new patient setup, so just wondering if I could get you or draw you little bit on sort of what level of decline you think. Mick Farrell : Yes. So, look at that company you mentioned is particularly a U.S. focused company and so that's a pretty good analog for the double-digit decline that happened in stocks for the U.S. geography that sort of 30%, so 70% before and then picking up from that nadir as an average across the country, it would have been lower in some states that have tighter lockdowns and more sleep lab focused and less than that in some of the more liberally in terms of opening states and, but then when you look across 140 countries, you really got to say, okay, well every country treated this differently, but Germany already being up to 85% of pre-COVID, that dip wasn't that low. I don't think they got below 75%, because they were able to pivot to sleep apnea testing pretty quickly and as you know we've got a grind in that market and have great visibility. China had a very steep drop, the government there was very strict in their lockdown and that went down, very high double-digits, and has now got back up to 50% all pre-COVID towards the end of June. And so, it's almost like and we have, you could model every over 140 countries by region, by city, and then, look at a sort of computational basis of this, but it gives us confidence with that detail the last 180 days of how this has gone to project for the next 360. But yes, look for the U.S., that sort of an idea in the high 60s and maybe an average around the 70% for the quarter, but leaving at rates higher than that is sort of where we're at for that geography. David Low : Great, thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Hashan De Silva of CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hashan De Silva : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get some color on ventilator pricing over 4Q. How much of a benefit with ventilator pricing over 4Q, and what do you expect the price to do coming into the first quarter? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Hashan, great question. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO. Rob Douglas : Yes, Hashan. We previously told, we actually had a policy of not trying to lift prices around this, mainly because of the whole ethics around it and making sure we were getting the ventilators in the right people's hands at the right prices. And so, we actually kept our pricing very steady through it and did slow some increased logistics cost and things like that that Brett was talking about, and we also make sure we were selling ventilators to people, who needed them immediately and were going to be using them. So we weren't selling it to stockpiles. So you can see we've had a pretty moderate approach to it, and we think it's absolutely the right approach. Obviously, the ventilators are higher price item compared to our fleet devices, and so, there was some sort of mix shift effect in our overall results, but we were very steady and our team was totally committed to making sure that we were looking after patients as a priority. Hashan De Silva : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning. Just on the gross margin, just -- I was wondering if you could give a bit more color on the outlook for that going forward. You'll have a lower proportion of ventilators, the negative mix shift, and then with the increased kind of [technical difficulty] actually expect to wake gross margin into the first quarter of '21, just any color you can give on that? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Brett, do you want to take that? Brett Sandercock : Sure, Mick. Hi, Gretel. Yes, I mean, you've covered a few of those moving parts in the gross margin and it's probably heightened on certainly at the moment with COVID-19 and where those impacts will end. We are seeing some elevated costs rolling through, and then some of those, I think, on freight will continue for a little while. We are actively trying to mitigate that, but I think -- I mean we would get drawn in specific guidance, but I think you'd have to say -- you'd have to say there's probably not likely that we had, we'd say gross margin expansion in the short-term. Gretel Janu : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon, Mick, Brett. Can you hear me all right? Mick Farrell : Yes, I've got you loud and clear, Suraj. Suraj Kalia : Perfect. So, Mick, I heard the $125 million contribution from ventilator sales in the quarter, forgive me, I was just hopping in between the calls. Can you give us the growth between North America and rest of the world in devices when you split out ventilators? Thank you for taking my question. Mick Farrell : Suraj, that's a great question, but it gets into a level of detail that we don't want to share for competitive reasons, but look, I can give some color around it, the $125 million in ventilator sales were to the countries that during that last 90 days you [technical difficulty] have seen through the media and other contexts had the biggest impacts from COVID-19. So I think publicly, we've talked about a contract with the U.S. government and FEMA, a $32 million public contract for 2,500 or so Astral devices, and then we had some public contracts with other countries, the U.K. the National Health Service, Germany, France, Japan and Australia. I thought some that I think we've talked about in various media areas, but just given the nature of sort of the competitive dynamics, but then also some of the hospital systems and nations like to choose to publicize to their own populations, those numbers at their own rate. I don't want to go into any further detail on that, but appreciate the question Suraj, and just know that -- one thing that really made us proud is that $125 million of ventilator sales save lives, and there are tens of thousands of people, who wouldn't have been breathing with COVID-19 that were, and if their immune system was able to beat this little protein virus, when it gets in the body, they lived, and we think that was a great benefit for those countries and for those individual people and their families. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Wheen of Evans & Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Wheen : Hi, good morning. I just had one clarification, and then my question. The clarification was just with regards to the one month sales figure that Brett mentioned, being in the low single digits. Can you just give us an indication as to how much -- whether that's just pure sleep or whether it includes ventilators? And then my question really -- I wanted to add to this was with regards to competitive bidding, there's been a regard reaction I guess to try and delay the implementation, I just wonder if you had any thoughts or likelihood of that actually happening. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Great questions, Steve. Brett, if you address the first part on the clarification and then we'll have Dave to talk to competitive bidding. Brett Sandercock : Yes, to clarify that that July group -- that's group revenue, Steve, on that. So that -- that's -- that's everything. That's the entire company. Steve Wheen : Okay. Mick Farrell : And with regard to your question on competitive bidding, Steve, I mean, we certainly support a delay. We were very pleased to see that just earlier this week. I believe a letter went over from over 100 members of the House and Senate urging the administration and CMS to delay competitive bidding. We've been working with other industry participants to try to advance that perspective. Obviously, there's a lot going on, and we don't get feedback from them as to whether it's likely or not, so we just have to wait and see with everyone else, but we certainly would support that. Having said that, we'll do what we can to support our customers, whenever competitive bidding does come out, so fingers crossed on that. Operator : Your next question is from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Great. Thanks. Maybe just one question as it relates to core sleep between resupply and vents. I'm assuming, the comments are mostly on new patient starts, but maybe just a quick update on resupply. And as we move into an extended first wave, do you expect that there is sort of benefit as we saw early on in the pandemic? And then a quick follow-up on comping would just be the world rule. I know there's a push to delay that as well H.R.2771. So, just an update on where the role in of world rates for comp that exists. Thanks again. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Anthony. I'll have a go at the first part of your question, and then Dave can have a go at the second part. In terms of the numbers I was talking about -- so the double digit declines and then coming up from those nadirs during April, May, June, and then what we expect during the year that was about patient flow, sleep apnea diagnosis, COPD patient diagnosis, and coming through the channel. So directly proportional to if you like, first time setup of a sleep device and first time setup of a mask system. As you know, Anthony, you followed us for a number of years, we've got a very resilient group of patients, who loves their great sleep and loves their great breathing and they are on resupply programs either directly through retail in Australia, Singapore, U.K., or through home care programs in Europe or direct HME programs in the U.S. We saw a very good resupply rates in the March quarter, and as we just talked about, saw a very good resupply rates in the June quarter. We expect those strong resupply rates to continue through September, December and onwards. This is a -- an ongoing resupply rate that that really will be there. Obviously, first time our setups are impacted by those numbers I was talking about in the modeling, but resupply numbers have been not only equal to the year before, but sometimes a little better, and we think the some secular change, they're around the importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of respiratory health, and people just wanting clean masks, clean tubing and clean humidifiers that they -- their insurance will pay for and then they could pay the copay for or out of pocket for themselves people are paying for those. And so, we think that sort of secular change they will be there giving us a pretty resilient resupply throughout fiscal 2021 and beyond. Dave, do you want to have a go at the second part of the question about sleeping? David Pendarvis : Sure. Thanks, Mick. Thanks for the question, Anthony. So with regard to the bill itself 2771, it remains introduced in the House. It hasn't seen a companion legislation get introduced to the Senate. Obviously, the U.S. government is preoccupied with a lot of other things that are -- they're working on now particularly trying to extend the aid. There probably will be some Medicare relief packages down the road, but we think it's an important shell of the will of Congress and sort of the sense of Congress that there ought to be relief in the rural areas. We were pleased to see that CMS has put a rule forward to advance telemedicine and telehealth reimbursement beyond the pandemic, and so, they're certainly listening to patients and providers and to Congress. We'd hope that they would listen to this and that CMS would be able to enact some relief, and it's always hazardous to predict the U.S. legislation. So, we certainly continue to support it. Many of the same congressional offices that supported 2771 were writing letters that I mentioned earlier about delaying competitive bidding. So, we think that's a strong vote, and we'd certainly continue to support it. We can't really predict what form, if any, relief will ultimately be granted. Thanks. Anthony Petrone : Thanks, again. Operator : Your next question is from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matthew Mishan : Hey, thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, congratulations on moving to the next stages for Propeller Health. Can you give us a sense of the commercial model that you settled on, and how should we think about the revenue ramp from here? Mick Farrell : Yes, Matt, it's a great question, and look, what I'll give is the generic revenue model of how we at Propeller -- through David Van Sickle, who's the CEO of Propeller and his commercial team globally, sort of the revenue models that they follow without giving any obviously details of any particular customer or partner. So, the general revenue models for Propeller are : number one, a development fee, there's often a development fee that we charge partners for the software engineers, who create the codes for the app that works specifically for that customer, that's a relatively monopod of the life cycle revenue, but it's there; and then secondly, we charge for the sense of the hardware that's provided each time that's sort of Propeller Sensor that has the cloud connectivity and then collects the data locally on usage adherence and other parameters; and then thirdly, which is the major part is the per activated user per month part of the revenue that is associated with that account. So then, that's really an alignment of Propeller ResMed's revenue with the pharmaceutical company, but also really importantly with the patient and their actual usage of it, and most importantly for their outcomes that they stay out of hospital longer it reduces total system costs, and so on. So, there's sort of three parts to that revenue, and all of them are in play for all of those customers that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and look, it's early days, this isn't yet material revenue for ResMed in this quarter or next quarter, but as we look over FY '21, FY '22, and certainly as we look to our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy, I think this digital health component and this recurring revenue component of medical adherence to COPD and asthma medications is going to be not only material part of our business, but a really exciting one for transforming care across the industry. Matthew Mishan : Great. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your last question is from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lyanne Harrison : Hi, Mick and team. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get a better understanding of resupply through the June quarter. Can you share what you saw through April, May and June? I guess I'm trying to understand if there was any sort of residual panic buying at the start of the quarter, and what are you experiencing as unemployment rates increase in the United States? Mick Farrell : Yes, Lyanne, thanks. It's a good question. Resupply was actually pretty steady through the April, May, June rates. We didn't -- year-on-year based on the cycles of where they are in the copay cycle and so on, obviously, there are double-digit unemployment numbers in the U.S. between 10% or 15% depending on the state, but in general, we have seen pretty steady resupply all of masks and accessories for customers, but Rob, do you want to provide any further color for Lyanne around the kinetics there? Rob Douglas : Yes, sure, Mick. Lyanne, we never really saw a big panic buy issue, or we couldn't triangulate into panic buying very much at all, but there were some other things going on with the resupply programs, the people operating them, and as we saw this as well, the callouts were more likely to find people at home because they're at home, and the response to the existing programs was better, and so, we did see some solid improvement, and that sort of continued, but there's no major sort of up and down dynamic. We think it's just steady, solid progress with patients on long-term treatment need good masks, and we've got the best masks, and the best systems to keep them in treatment, and we expect that to continue through notwithstanding what else happens, given the uncertainties of COVID. Lyanne Harrison : Great, thank you very much. Operator : We are now at the one-hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Cheryl, and thanks to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd also like to once again take the opportunity to thank all 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work, not just this quarter and this year, but over the years, helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the frontline, production, distribution, tech service, and those who help in the set-up of our ventilators and ventilation masks during this global crisis. You helped over 150,000 people potentially through those products, and I look forward to thinking you in person when this is all possible post-COVID, and we'll talk to everyone on this call in about 90 days. Thanks a lot. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly or to our general Investor Relations line. As previously mentioned, all the documents along with a transcript and a replay of today's call will be available on our Web site later today. Cheryl, you may now go ahead and close the call. Operator : This concludes ResMed's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Cheryl. Hello, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us. As Cheryl said, this webcast -- this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and the quarterly results presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. On the call today to discuss our quarterly results are our CEO Mick Farrell and CFO Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion following our prepared remarks.  During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.  And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mick. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today. Since this COVID-19 pandemic began in January, ResMed has produced hundreds of thousands of ventilators, providing the gift of breath to people in need in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to support frontline respiratory medical professionals, health care providers, patients and our teammates, ResMedians, so they are all safe and healthy. We also continue to provide ventilators as local state and national health care providers are facing second and third waves of COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalizations. Thankfully, the magnitude of these hospitalization waves and thus, the need for emergency ventilators is decreasing over time.  In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and beyond are steadily increasing as well as prescription therapy flow from those diagnoses. Growing numbers of people are returning to health care systems, including primary care as well as specialist care. We are seeing more health care systems come back online through telehealth and in-person visits. Overall treatment capacity as well as capacity utilization rates of those systems are both increasing. We have seen a steady sequential, what we would call U-shape recovery of patient flow to primary care physicians as well as then to specialist physicians across the 140 countries that we serve. This is just as we forecast 90 days ago on our Q4 earnings call. We expect this same patient flow growth trend to continue throughout fiscal year 2021. In my remarks today, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q1 business results, and then I'll hand over to Brett to walk us through further detail. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly as well as our annual operating priorities.  Today, we have reported high single-digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results speak to our team's ability to nimbly pivot to meet short-term needs for emergency ventilators, while also investing for the long-term growth in our core markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and out-of-hospital medical software.  Our investments in research and development for digital health technology have accelerated these last 9 months as we see increasing demand from patients, physicians, providers as well as health care systems as they embrace digital health through remote patient engagement as well as population health management technology. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $144 million of cash, allowing us to return $57 million of cash as dividends to our shareholders. At the same time, though, we have increased our research and development investments at double-digit rates, including investments in digital health clinical research as well as hardware and software innovation across both our med tech and our Software as a Service businesses. We have a very full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for customers with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs.  Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences and to drive lower total health care system costs. We now have over 7 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based Air Solutions platform. We've provided over 12.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices to customers, and we have over 14 million patients enrolled in our AirView software solution.  During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world, including a recognition of the value of remote patient monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models. We have seen much greater collaboration between the med tech industry and governments globally, not just in ventilators but well beyond. An encouraging example of this was just a few days ago when the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or CMS announced that it will be maintaining current reimbursement rates in our product categories in January 2021. This is great news. And in part, it is due to industry feedback that it was inappropriate to make unnecessary changes, particularly during an ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency, and really importantly, that current rates were appropriate for the services being provided.  We've also seen governments in Germany, France, Japan and across the U.S. adopt models to facilitate digital health and remote care that will be important, not only during this pandemic but well beyond. This is better health care at lower costs, leveraging technology. These trends support ResMed's 2025 strategy, and we believe that the accelerated adoption of digital health solutions represents a significant medium and long-term tailwind for our business.  These 3 trends : one, the increased importance of respiratory medicine; two, the increased importance of digital health; and three, the increased importance of out-of-hospital health care, will all help ResMed meet and beat our goal of growing volume at double digits from 2020 through 2025 and improving over 250 million lives by 2025.  Let me now highlight a few examples of innovation and execution in support of our strategic priorities. Just a recap of our strategy priorities : a, to grow and differentiate our sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; b, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices and digital health solutions; and c, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered away from the hospital.  In our core market of sleep apnea, we introduced our latest mask innovation in September. It's called the AirTouch N20. This innovation is the first nasal mask with a memory foam cushion. As a patient myself, I'm happy to say that this is ResMed's softest nasal mask ever. The memory foam technology of the AirTouch N20 adapts to the curves and contours of the person's face, creating a personalized fit that is designed to increase comfort and to make it easier for the patient to adhere to sleep apnea therapy. The adherence rates for ResMed solutions are the best in the industry. And it is innovation and technology like this new AirTouch N20 that helps get us there.  Our mask portfolio is crafted to offer physicians market-leading options for prescribing for each patient. To enable home care providers to successfully fit the patient the first time every time and to satisfy the desires of the ultimate customer. That's the person who suffocates each night with sleep apnea. Our focus on innovation to meet customer needs will never end. We are innovating with smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more intelligent solutions every day. We have an exciting pipeline ahead.  Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to deliver better care for COPD and asthma patients worldwide. During the June quarter, we launched in Europe an upgraded version of our AirView cloud-based remote monitoring software, specifically designed for our ventilation solutions. This solution called AirView for ventilation provides remote monitoring capability, allowing clinicians to quickly access clinical data from ResMed ventilation devices wherever they are and to allow them to more easily triage and prioritize both chronic needs and acute needs for ventilated patients. This completely reimagined platform transforms the management of ventilated patients, allowing doctors, nurses and all clinicians and care providers to ascertain powerful patient insights from huge respiratory medical data sets. Adoption of the AirView for ventilation solution has been rapid and strong.  Our team was really thrilled to deliver for our customers during the COVID emergency with this solution, but the value that is being provided by AirView for ventilation is ongoing for physicians and health care systems. We are making digital health part of the standard of care. During the quarter, we expanded the reach of our market-leading Propeller Health technology, specifically through our partnership with pharmaceutical company, Novartis. During the quarter, Novartis announced the launch of 2 new once-daily medications to treat uncontrolled asthma in Japan. These products are called Enerzair and Atectura Breezhaler. In this market, patients using either the Enerzair or the Breezhaler manage their uncontrolled asthma will be able to acquire a Propeller technology sensor from physicians and then enroll in our Propeller digital health platform. The benefits of the platform are tremendous. The offering is a simple and convenient way to better live with sleep apnea with a fully integrated digital experience, with no incremental cost to the patient. It's great to see our Novartis partnership expanding to include now both Europe and Japan, leveraging our world-leading Propeller technology.  Let me now briefly review our out-of-hospital Software as a Service business. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by continued strong uptake of our HME resupply solutions. The COVID-19 market dynamics continue to impact the patient census volumes, particularly at skilled nursing facilities and new patient admissions have remained under pressure. We are maintaining our forecast that the SaaS market growth rate will be in the mid-single-digit range for the portfolio of verticals that we serve for fiscal 2021. We expect the portfolio to return to high single-digit growth as hospital and other outpatient surgery center discharge rates return to normal.  We continue to invest in research and development for our SaaS businesses, so that we continuously improve on our market-leading solutions in home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice as well as private duty home care and life plan communities. As this portfolio of SaaS verticals returns to high single-digit growth, ResMed will continue to be there with our R&D resulting in leading Brightree and MatrixCare branded technology solutions, allowing us to better serve customers and therefore, to not just meet but to beat that market growth rate.  A year ago, we announced that ResMed would begin collaborating with Cerner Corporation to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions to control costs and to deliver seamless care across health care systems, from the hospital to the home. We have now integrated our MatrixCare branded home health and hospice platform with the electronic health record or EHR system from Cerner. I'm excited to let you know that we've expanded our relationship with Cerner to new offerings and have now entered into a new value-added reseller arrangement with Cerner. This establishes our Brightree technology as the preferred solution for Cerner's home medical equipment, pharmacy and home infusion customers. This development is the next step in the ResMed-Cerner relationship and will lead to better interoperability, it will lead to enhanced provider capabilities and it will lead to an improved patient experience. Overall, this partnership is performing above expectations for both ResMed and Cerner. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to involve our core markets of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma disease management over time. Stay tuned.  In summary, the SaaS portfolio is performing well and remains an important driver of our digital transformation of health care in settings outside the hospital.  2020 has been an unprecedented year for companies across every industry. The fundamentals of our ResMed business, however, remains strong, and we've maintained growth through this crisis through breakthrough innovation, through investments in recurring revenue businesses and effective execution in our operating excellence programs. COVID-19 has accelerated digital health adoption as well as awareness of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. The importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of digital health and the importance of health care delivered away from a hospital. These trends are present during COVID, but they're here to stay.  Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere thanks to more than 7,500 ResMedians, who -- that's what we call ourselves around the world for their perseverance and strength, hard work and dedication during unique once-in-a-century circumstances. You have allowed hundreds of thousands of people around the world to get emergency ventilators and to have the gift of breath, while also keeping focus on making sure we have the best technology and solutions now and in the future for sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and all those who need world-class care outside the hospital and preferably in their own home. Thank you all. With that, I'll hand the call now over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and some remarks on our FY '21 outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $752 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the first quarter were favorably impacted by continued demand for ventilator devices and accessories. We estimate that the incremental revenue benefit from ventilator devices and related accessories derived from COVID-19 demand was approximately $40 million in the first quarter. Additionally, we experienced strong mask revenue growth in both our domestic and international markets. However, we did observe continuing headwinds in the sleep device market.  Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $257 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or an increase of 10% in constant currency terms.  By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $206 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $176 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an 11% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $81 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 11% over the prior year quarter.  Software as a Service revenue for the first quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 4%.  During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.  Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 30 basis points to 59.9% in the September quarter compared to 59.6% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by increased costs associated with logistics and procurement costs, together with typical declines in average selling prices. The cost increases largely reflect the impact of COVID-19 and our rapid ramp-up of ventilator production.  We saw elevated airfreight costs relative to the prior year, but these are tracking sequentially lower, particularly as we rebalance from air freight to sea freight.  Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $159 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 7% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.1% compared to 24.6% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as we work through the uncertain COVID-19 environment. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q2 to be broadly consistent with the prior year period and then in the second half of FY '21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period.  R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 12%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 7.1% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize our investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology and product development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in the high single digits to low double digits, reflecting our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles.  Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million.  Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $237 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin and well-managed operating expenses.  On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 17.4%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $185 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.27, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.22.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $144 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital.  Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million.  We recorded equity losses of $2.3 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million in Q2 and approximately $5 million per quarter in the second half of FY '21 associated with the joint venture operation.  We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $421 million. At September 30, we had $1.1 billion in gross debt and $635 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had a further $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are tightly managing expenses, cash flow and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.  Turning now to our FY '21 outlook. At a high level, we are now seeing a minimal COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in Q2 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to see a continued year-on-year headwind for sleep devices in Q2 in response to temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. However, at this time, we continue to forecast a sequential improvement in sleep devices through the course of FY '21. Masks and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 3 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask portfolio in FY '21. Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment. And as a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.  And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett. Let's now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Cheryl, let's go ahead and start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs. Chris Cooper : Could you please -- I mean you mentioned at the start, the announcement from CMS this week. Could you just confirm your interpretation of where we stand with competitive bidding now? I mean the wording seem to suggest to us that the structure of the bid as a current standard is not working as they intended. Is your expectation at this stage that we just move on for the next 3-year cycle with competitive bidding? Or do you think they'll try and rerun it ahead of that? Michael Farrell : Thanks for the question, Chris. And look, the one thing we know is that January 1, 2021, the rates will remain where they are. And that -- it was great that CMS listened to feedback from the industry. And it wasn't just around COVID, it was really around the fact that reimbursement rates currently as they are fit for the need. And if you read through the detail, the CMS actually said that through the process, they found that they weren't going to have any savings as they put it, which meant from my perspective that we've reached sort of market equilibrium in terms of where things are at. Now that's my interpretation. But Dave Pendarvis studies this far more detail than I do. Dave, do you want to give some more color and thoughts around the CMS announcement these last few days? David Pendarvis : Sure. So Chris, yes, our view of the probable outcome here is you've got a 3-year run at least until January 1, 2024, of these current rates, plus inflation adjustments on January 1 on each of those years. Those are in the competitive bid areas. In addition to that, CMS has got a proposed rule-out, which if they finalize, would add a continuation of the 50-50 blended rate in rural areas. Those are both really good outcomes for our industry. They provide stability, they provide rates that these folks can count on, and they allow for any willing provider to be able to provide in the markets. Now you can always find legislative opportunities for the administration to do different things, to come in earlier, to change things up a little bit. That -- so is it possible? Sure. Is it likely? We don't think so. So we're going to be basing our plans on a continuation of these rates going forward with the caveat that governments can always do things that are unexpected and subject to their own control. Chris Cooper : Is there any risk that the commercial payers begin to take things into their own hands slowly and move ahead of Medicare? Michael Farrell : So Chris, the private payers were already ahead of CMS on this and had been sort of on a mark-to-market basis doing things at their own rates before competitive bidding started back in the mid-2000s during and after. And so I don't think it's a risk. It's a guarantee that private payers are looking for market rates. I think what's great about this one because it's so public versus those sort of private negotiations that happen is that we've seen a public statement of an equilibrium reached between the bids that came in and the fair price that is appropriate for the provision of these services in the statement. So that's something that's new as part of it. But look, it's a complex web. We sell in 140 countries worldwide, not just one. We watch CMS, but we also watch the rest of the world, and we want to make sure that reimbursement rates are there for our channel, but really importantly, that we get to the 936 million people worldwide who suffer from sleep apnea. Operator : Your next question is from Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley. Sean Laaman : I'd like to just ask about the sustainability and that suppression in SG&A growth. It seems like a very good outcome. If you could talk us through that? I know we've got guidance for fiscal '21, but if you could talk us through that, that would be really useful, Mick. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Sean. I'll start, and I'll hand over to Brett for some more detail. Yes, look, excellent control. Obviously, travel costs are incredibly down. We have 75%, 80% of all the ResMedians worldwide selling in 140 countries working from home. And we've had a really smooth transition to 4,000, 5,000 people working from home and feeling comfortable doing so. And we are opening up our offices as appropriate in Europe, Asia and the Americas as cities, states and so on allow us to.  Look, when we get to the other side of this pandemic, and that's a long time potentially with a vaccine and treatments that are efficacious, I do see some of those costs starting to go back up again, but they will be also concomitant with opening of health care systems that will be associated with the opening up of those economies. And so I think we've done a really good job in bringing expenses down on SG&A, 7% reduction year-on-year for the quarter to $159 million for the September quarter.  But if you look closely, we also increased our R&D spend. We increased by 12%, constant currency, our R&D spend. And that's $54.5 million for the quarter. You annualize that, that's a really good $200-plus million that we're going to put into digital health technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, improvements in smaller, quiet and more comfortable, more connected and more intelligent systems that can keep people breathing out of hospital and well taken care of. And so we are going to continue the investments in R&D and drive those through this crisis, and we are going to take the savings on SG&A now and be ready to reinvest in marketing and sales and growth in that SG&A as appropriate when the revenues start to come back. I hope that all makes sense, Sean. It's not just a one portfolio play, it's all part of a larger piece. Sean Laaman : No. That makes a lot of sense. Great results. Operator : Your next question... Brett Sandercock : Sean, it's Brett. The only thing I'd add to add to that, it's a good summary from Mick, there's not too much more to add there. But I mean, clearly, we're not going to have negative SG&A every quarter. And we have -- I've got in the back half to kind of low double digits. And for that low double digits, mid-single digits is probably what we've consistently done. Really, our aim is we want to leverage SG&A relative to revenue growth. So that hasn't gone away, but we want to continue to do that in the medium to long term as well. Operator : Your next question is from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. Gretel Janu : So just at the last results, I think you mentioned that in July, you saw low single-digit revenue growth. This does then imply quite a sharp acceleration growth in August and September. So can you give us some more color on the incremental performance on a month-to-month basis as well as to how you performed into October? Michael Farrell : Thanks, Gretel. It's a great question as we sort of model the kinetics of the recovery across our 140 countries. And as we look at it, and we -- obviously, I look at daily numbers, not just month-to-month and beyond, but there's a lot of sort of noise when you go down to a lower level of distraction. You pull back and you look at sort of that quarter-on-quarter trend, what we're seeing is sequential growth across the group. And let's look at some -- look at 3 big countries. And I think I talked about this 90 days ago, Gretel, but Germany is sort of, I would say, our leading country in terms of how they're opening up their economy. We are seeing at 85%, 90-plus percent of the pre-COVID patient flow and in some parts, 90% to 95% of the pre-COVID patient flow. It's through telehealth, it's through digital medicine, it's also through some in-person visits and in-lab tests. And so we're really at a very high point of recovery. And even with Angela Merkel closing restaurants and bars here in November, we do expect health systems to remain fully open during not just November, but on an ongoing basis because people need to get their primary care, people need to get their respiratory care. If they're suffocating, they need treatment for their sleep apnea. If they have trouble breathing, they need help for their COPD. And so we're seeing that in a really good case in Germany. If you take China, another big market we talked about last quarter, sort of at the 50% of pre-COVID levels. This quarter, China is now already at 70% of pre-COVID patient flow across a very large country, but that portfolio of different cities and states is now at 70% of pre-COVID, so a significant improvement from last quarter. And here in the United States, it's really a story of 50 different states and their approaches, but they vary from 60% to 80% if you think about it of the pre-COVID patient flow. And so on average of around 70% here in our biggest market in the United States. So you take that all and you see, yes, there is pretty strong sequential improvement. It's not a dramatic sort of V shape we're back to January 1 or December 31, 2019. But the -- every week, it does get better. Every month, it does get better across the portfolio of countries. Even with the second and third waves of Northern Hemisphere, with the coming flu period, we expect to see sequential improvement in the flow of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients into our system. Operator : Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : I just wanted to follow-up a little bit about the drivers like you said of new patient adds and mostly improvements that you're seeing. I understand the 90%, 70%, 70% are pre-COVID levels. But how much of that is being driven by clinics, sleep clinics reopening relative to home sleep testing? Meaning is home sleep testing accelerating? And would that be a more sustainable trend as we go forward 2, 3 years from now that PCPs are adopting this and you can get a steady trend of new patient adds from there? Michael Farrell : Yes, Margaret, it's a really good question. I'm going to hand to Jim for some further detail on this way. Across the world, we're seeing home sleep test -- home sleep apnea testing picked up over time. COVID-19 has been an accelerator for that because it was the only choice during the severe lockdowns. And as we get to the other side, it is lower cost and has equivalent sensitivity and specificity from the technology that's out there. But Jim, what further color do you have on that? James Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret. It's a great question and it's a very insightful question. We don't have perfect data on this. But the data we do have and both the concrete data we have from sort of looking at our own devices that are used and also anecdotal data from the market very strongly suggests that home sleep testing across most of our markets has become a much higher percentage of testing. And to your point, I do think that that is sustainable. I think what we're seeing is a shift in practice. Patients certainly prefer it. And I think a number of clinicians are seeing that it's an easier way for them to diagnose, and they're certainly using home sleep testing and remote testing to serve their short-term patient needs. But as it gets adopted, I think we will see that practice remain very sustainable. And so in a market like France, we are already at something like 90% home sleep testing. We don't have perfect insight, as I said, but we do think home sleep test in the U.S. market has hit a very high percentage of tests, and we think that that will stick in the future. Michael Farrell : The one bit of color I'll add on there, just to tag onto what Jim said, Margaret, is Germany, where there was actually quite a strong resistance from some sleep physicians to adopt home sleep apnea testing. They were skeptical of the efficacy, the practicality and could they really make it work. And because of the shutdowns were very strong in Germany during the peak of the crisis in March, April, it was the only way they could diagnose. The doctors then got used to it. And to Jim's point, I think on the other side of this, France will move up a little bit, but Germany will move up significantly in the percentage of patients with home sleep apnea testing as those doctors found that it was not only -- had high sensitivity and specificity on the clinical level, but it also had good outcomes at lower costs. Operator : Your next question is from David Low of JPMorgan. Michael Farrell : David, you may be on mute. David Low : Yes. No, no. I was just getting the mute off. If I could just go back to the ventilators, I mean what I understood from was said that there was a $40 billion boost coming through there, and that we really should expect that that's pretty much done now. So that normalizes. And if we adjust for that, it would imply that the device sales growth was significantly lower. Just wondering how you think we should think about the recovery from here? I mean are we at the point now where device sales ex-ventilators can start to grow given how strong the recovery seems to have been through the quarter? Michael Farrell : Yes, David, it's a really good question. I'll hand to Brett for some further detail on it after my remarks. But look, we've seen -- we saw incredible sort of $30 million in the March quarter, triple-digit millions of dollars in the June quarter, and as you noted, $40 million in the September quarter of what I would call emergency ventilator sales as part of the crisis. It may not go to precisely 0 this quarter, but it won't be as high in the December quarter as it was in the September quarter. And hopefully, as we're seeing the second and third waves, the magnitude, as I said in the prepared remarks, is lower of the second and third waves in terms of the impact on hospitalizations and reaching that sort of peak, ICU peak ventilator capacity. And so on a humanitarian basis, I hope we're right in that prediction that it goes very quickly down.  We are seeing sequentially, from the June quarter to the September quarter, improvements in the number of patients coming through, the prescriptions coming through, and therefore, the devices that we are selling on the sleep side. We expect that improvement to continue through the December quarter. And so as you look through the fiscal year and you think about sort of modeling how that's going to happen, I think you can model a steady increase in the sleep apnea devices. And the sort of, what I will call a secular uptick in masks and accessories sales that was driven by, I think, respiratory hygiene and the importance of getting a clean mask, was not a onetime thing for the March or June quarter. You saw it was sustainable. As we predicted, it was sustainable here through the September quarter. And I think it's sustainable through the December quarter.  I'm a patient and I know how important it is and how exciting it is, frankly, to get that new mask, to get that new cushion and to establish it up. It's like a brand-new cast mill and you get addicted to saying, \"Wow, respiratory health is important,\" and that is one thing through the suffering of COVID-19. It's almost a blessing that we've seen people realize that sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, respiratory health is incredibly important and keeping your device clean and keeping your mask clean is incredibly important as well as accessing data digitally has been incredibly important. So we think all of that will be there, and that's why we talk about this strong sequential increase, steady sequential increase throughout fiscal 2021. Brett, any further color? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. I mean that's good now. I mean, Dave, you're right. I mean, obviously, year-on-year, we saw declines in sleep devices. But we saw a pretty strong sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. And then going forward, as Mick said, we will -- we still think we'll see that sequential improvement. Now where does that end up in Q2, Q3, increase or decrease, we won't -- time will tell. But certainly, we're seeing that nice sequential increase week-to-week, month-to-month, which gives us, I think, a lot of confidence of sleep devices improving throughout FY '21. I think that's the main thing we're looking at. It's that nice strong financial increase, I think, that will give us a lot of confidence. David Low : Just on topic, I know I don't want to ask the second question. But I mean, I take $40 million of devices, actually, negative 1.6% growth for the quarter. So it looks pretty close to flat there. And I presume that's indicative of where CPAPs at relative to the same time last year. Michael Farrell : Yes, there will be some -- yes, I mean, there's constant currency adjustments, things like that, but certainly decreased, single-digit decreases. Operator : Your next question is with Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America. Lyanne Harrison : Just following on from Margaret Kaczor's question. Thinking about the initiatives that have been put in place as a result of coronavirus, including telehealth, home sleep testing, can you give us some indication of how the reimbursement works for that? With home sleep testing, for example, are patients more likely to be out of pocket? And do you think that the reimbursement with the likes of telehealth will remain post coronavirus? Michael Farrell : Lyanne, it's a great question, and it talks to how sustainable is what we're talking about earlier, Jim and I around home sleep apnea testing being adopted. In general, the costs for home sleep apnea testing are significantly below for the payer, the employer and the ultimate payer is the person who works for that company or pays the taxes in that country. So the numbers of the costs are significantly lower, often in order of magnitude lower. And so therefore, the copayments, if you're part of, say, U.S. plan like I'm, we have copayments, the copayment is proportional to the cost. And so therefore, an order of magnitude lower. So it is lower cost. And the question that physicians always had is, is it better care or at least as good care at lower cost. And I think what we saw through COVID-19, where people who hadn't adopted home sleep apnea testing as well, were forced to adopt it because it was the only way they could diagnose patients. They found well, the sensitivity and specificity from that clinical peer-reviewed article does happen in my practice, in my state, in my city. And so lower cost, as good outcomes, we saw great adoption. And I think that drives ongoing growth of it on a sustainable basis. As Jim was talking to earlier, I think countries that were x move to y, where y is above x, and we can't predict exactly what that permanent change is going to be. We just know it's going to move up because the momentum of economics and good clinical care just drive it that way. So I don't know, Jim, if you have any further color to provide on that from your last response on home sleep apnea testing. James Hollingshead : I just would completely reiterate what you said. And as a reminder, if you're on a, let's say, U.S. market, if you're a consumer and you have a health plan, you have a 20% copay. If a typical lab test is $1,500 or $1,800, that you're out of pocket on that at 20%. If the typical home sleep test is reimbursed at, say, $250, $200, you're much lower out of pocket. And so for consumers, the barrier is much lower to do a home sleep test here. Most consumers would prefer a home sleep test. And so that's why I think we'll see it remain sticky.  Now to telehealth, which I think was the second part of your question, some of those reimbursements have been done on sort of an emergency basis. The question is how? Will they persist after the emergency situations are declared nonemergency? There are a number of reasons to think that they will. I think that they've been very successful. And of course, the industry is lobbying very hard to put some of the things in place, both with government payers and with commercial payers. And so I think that most payers have seen telehealth to be pretty successful in terms of driving coverage and also driving down cost of care. So we can be optimistic about that. And I think the whole industry is working on it. Michael Farrell : Yes. And this has actually been a sort of public-private partnership during COVID-19 as we all made the ventilators and partnered with the governments to do so that we have partnered on digital health, bringing -- as Jim said, bringing the emergency user authorization capability for that. There were actually codes that CMS had for digital health that were being underutilized in 2019. They brought them out early, I believe, in 2019. And even in 2018, we're doing some trials with them, and they were actually upset at CMS that the digital health codes weren't being utilized enough. COVID-19 drove an acceleration of that. And I think it will allow, again, the same thing as home sleep apnea testing applies to telehealth and all remote patient care, it's better during COVID times that you not go to that clinic because you won't get as exposed, not to that hospital, you won't get as exposed. It's also better during normal times, if you can do stuff at lower cost with better outcomes and not having to go to that hospital, not having to go to that clinic, if you can do it from the comfort of your own home. And as Jim said, the consumer prefers lower cost and at their own home, and that's all of ResMed's strategies to give that health care way you want it. Operator : Next question is from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. Matt Mishan : Mick, I'll keep this one simple. Can you just give us a sense of when Propeller Health can become more meaningful to the P&L? Michael Farrell : Thanks, Matthew. Good question. Propeller Health is early phase in terms of the technology. It's certainly having a huge impact in getting a major multi-hundred billion-dollar pharma companies to adopt it with their brand-new prescribable drugs, particularly in the asthma space in Europe and Japan. As to when it becomes a material part of ResMed's P&L and I'm breaking it out on a quarterly basis, it's going to be a while for that. And so it won't be in here in fiscal 2021. But as we look to our 2025 strategy over these next 5 years, I do expect that that type of digital health solution is going to be a double-digit part of ResMed's delivery, and I will be talking about it on a quarterly basis, not just through milestones of pharmaceutical company releases with lead products and brand-new not generics, but high-end prescribable products. I think that we will see this go well beyond where it started just here in asthma. It will go across COPD. And there are literally billions -- tens of billions of dollars that could be saved in keeping COPD patients out of hospital with better adherence to their drugs.  Our work has shown that we can improve adherence rates by up to 58% and lower total cost of emergency visits and emergency costs by 25%. But look, it's a great question, Matthew. I'm not going to predict the exact quarter and timing, but I can tell you that over the next 20 quarters, it will become a significant part. We will be calling it out because it works. And pharmaceutical companies know how to do things at scale. And when they start to see that it improves the outcomes for their patients, that their doctors are happier and most importantly, that the patients are happier and out of hospital, lower cost, better outcomes, it's going to take off very quickly, exponentially. Operator : Your next question is from Saul Hadassin of UBS. Saul Hadassin : Mick, can I just ask you, I don't think it was in your prepared remarks, but you did preview the Lumis HFT device at the ERS Conference this quarter. Can you talk to, I guess, a bit more detail as to where you see that device sitting in within the portfolio of the ResMed offering and when we might expect to see that device commercialized? Michael Farrell : Yes. I'll provide just a little overview, and then I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to provide further. Look, what we've seen during COVID-19 is a variety of different products and solutions that have been used for patients from oxygen to high-flow therapy, to full noninvasive ventilation and then full invasive intubated ventilation. So I think there was some good exposure to what high-flow therapy can do with COVID because it can provide some of the particles to move around hospitals and so on. HFT did not get as frontline on its therapy as fully intubated ventilators. But we think it gave some good exposure and has accelerated a little bit. Yes, this is very early days with high-flow therapy, but it's a technology that we've put together on some of our existing platforms with great intellectual property and great opportunities for growth over time. But Rob, do you want to provide some further detail on what we're doing with Lumis HFT? Robert Douglas : Yes, sure. Thanks, Mick. So yes, we think HFT is clearly a valid treatment and got some very interesting use cases. We -- again, you know our strategy is out of hospital, and it hasn't been strongly studied in those types of environments. So really, it's more part of a long-term play to see how HFT might fit in with our long-term strategy. It's a trial that will take its time to enroll patients. These respiratory device trials in the home setting are generally pretty tough to do and so -- and take a time. So we won't be reporting out of that super quickly, but it's certainly a very interesting area for us, and we think we've got some good solutions. Operator : Your next question is from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer. Suraj Kalia : Mick, one question from my side. The SaaS unit is now growing at single digits. Can you help us understand the structural dynamics that could possibly push the segment back to double-digit growth? Is there price elasticity of demand? Are you looking at OUS adoption? Are acquisitions the key? Just help us frame this segment, in particular, for the next 12, 24 months. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Suraj. It's a great question. So Software as a Service, our SaaS division, is 12% of our revenues. It's a really important part of our long-term growth to apply our digital health technology capability outside the hospital and in the 7 verticals we're in where we're a market leader in the top 1 or 2 of each of those categories. Yes, as I noted in the prep remarks, Suraj, we've seen a slowdown of the flow of patients into hospitals and therefore, out of hospitals to skilled nursing facilities, in particular, as well as nursing homes and others. And we do expect that that, sort of, if you like, recovery will take some time. And that's why I sort of said that the markets that we serve as a weighted average portfolio growth will grow in those sort of mid-single digits throughout this fiscal year. We expect to meet that and beat that where we can.  And then as we get to beyond the sort of 12-month time frame, I do think there's opportunities for those markets to get to the high single-digit growth. And with inorganic plays, there are opportunities to get to low double-digit growth across that portfolio. Look, we never accept market growth. We want to meet it and beat it. One thing we are doing in that division as well as in our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma groups is we're investing in innovation. We have great -- in the beauty of Software as a Service innovation is you're talking weeks between sprints and then getting an MVP out there to provide a solution to customers. And so we have seen some really good innovation come into play to help people deal with COVID-19 that have helped them sort of through this crisis. And we think that when we get back to the sort of normal flow through hospitals and ASCs of patients getting discharged into the out-of-hospital post-acute network, we will start to see the centers pick up and therefore, the revenues pick up as the number of patients in that setting picks up over time. And so yes, look, we have a leading position. We're going to do well in the mid-single digits. We'll do well in the high single digits. And over time, as we add inorganically, we can push even beyond that. Operator : Your next question is from David Bailey of Macquarie. David Bailey : Mick, you sort of touched on the resupply coming through, expecting that to continue into the second quarter. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you're seeing that opportunity over the medium to longer term? Do you think there's further opportunities on the resupply? And then within that mask and accessories as well, just whether you think some of the new product launches are driving increased share for ResMed? That would be great. Michael Farrell : Thanks, David. Yes, that's a 2-part question. So I'll have a go. Actually, you know, I'm going to hand the whole question to Jim Hollingshead rather than do half of it. Over to you, Jim. James Hollingshead : Thank you for the question, David. I mean we think -- we've been obviously quite pleased with the dynamics of resupply through Q1. We expect it to continue in Q2. And actually, I do think what's going on, especially, probably, globally, but the dynamics of resupply are really a specific to U.S. market where reimbursed. And we think what's going on is that, a, patients want new clean equipment, they're more synthesized to that because of the pandemic; and b, our HME provider customers have realized that that's an avenue that's both better for the patients and better for patient care, but also better for their own business. So we think that dynamic should stay.  One thing -- we had a question earlier about competitive bidding. One of the good results at a competitive bidding being delayed for some period of time is that it won't change mask reimbursement. And so we think that with the competitive bidding reannouncement, it maintains the economics of resupply that exist in the U.S. market, which is our biggest resupply market. And that's one of the reasons we think that the dynamics for that part of the market will persist through, I think, at least in the fiscal year. I think that it will remain robust. So we've got a change in customer behavior, change in patient behavior, both of which tend to resupply and then stability and reimbursement. And I think those are really key points.  On market share, we have the broadest and most effective portfolio of masks and accessories on the market. We can -- with our range of products now and with our latest launch of the AirTouch N20, our line is complete across our range of masks, and we can provide a certain fit for every patient with the right mask every time. None of our competitors come even close to what we offer in the market, and we feel really good about our share and position and our ongoing innovation. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. Andrew Goodsall : Just thinking about the quarter, just wondering if you saw any DME restocking effect in the quarter. And also if I could just ask you to talk to oxygen, whether that's still getting us some tailwind with COVID? Michael Farrell : So the first question about restocking, second one about POCs. Look, Brett, do you want to take something with regard to the restocking and talk about inventory levels from Q-on-Q? And then, Rob, do you want to have a go at the oxygen question. Over to you, Brett, first? Brett Sandercock : Yes, sure, Mick. I mean typically on the whole DME, they don't hold too much inventory. So I guess they've got -- they typically buy pretty regularly. I'm not sure. I mean, as volumes have come up and patient flows come back. Obviously, there's orders coming in the system to support the patient flow coming back, and we're seeing that sequentially, but I'm not sure they're really restocking like huge orders. They'll restock as the patient flow comes back in a pretty orderly fashion. And obviously, we're seeing that throughout our revenues and sequentially what's happening there. But I wouldn't say it is characterized by significant restocking orders. I think that's a bit more steady flow that we're seeing coming through it. Andrew Goodsall : Okay. So I got a reasonable match up with the sort of return of patients to return of orders? Brett Sandercock : Yes, I think so because they don't like holding a lot of inventory. So they all typically do -- they can get inventory quite quickly from the manufacturers, and they'll typically operate -- obviously, they need enough inventory. And -- but I think the patient flow will drive their order patterns. Andrew Goodsall : That's great. And then just on POC. Robert Douglas : Andrew, yes, our POC program sort of just continues as we have -- we continue to learn. We've still got our products in their sort of product launch, process and post that. And we continue to learn, and we're sort of still making adjustments and experiments of how to get the right patients to the right providers for the right treatment there. So it's pretty much a sort of a long-term thing for us on that. Andrew Goodsall : No particular call out on COVID around that? Robert Douglas : No. Not that material to our overall business. Operator : Your next question is from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Maybe just a couple on math questions on vents and NIVs and just comments in relation to COVID cases and NIVs going forward. And so when we back out the $40 million from devices and you sort of bake in patient flows in core sleep, I'm just wondering, again, the math doesn't quite get there to low single digits. So I'm wondering if pricing, in particular, firmed up in the quarter that can kind of get you there or other respiratory was better.  And then again, the comment on NIVs going forward, potentially not being a driver. Just wondering why that would be considering where the case counts are going? Michael Farrell : Thanks, Anthony. Yes, look, it's a complex equation, and there are so many moving pieces with second and third waves as regards to the global pandemic. So all we know about every prediction that's been made in the last 9 months is they're wrong. So we don't know precisely what the needs are going to be through the second and third waves. And last quarter, we were a bit muted about what we thought would happen this quarter and then we had $40 million worth of sales in the September quarter. But look, our best projections of the sort of epidemiology and sort of humanitarian model that we put together at the flow of COVID-19 around 140 countries that we treat in within the big countries, specifically in some cities and states that we're looking at, we don't think we're going to reach a state where there's going to be hospitalizations like we had early January, February in Wuhan, and then March -- February, March in Milan and then March, April in New York, where you reached 100% capacity and literally ran out of ventilators and ran out of ICU beds for those ventilators.  Our best models show that the magnitude of the second and third waves are actually reduced in cities in China, that we've seen second and third waves, across Singapore, where we've seen them in in some parts of Europe, where we're already seeing them. And so we're just being realistic that we don't expect sort of those emergency use ventilators to be at the sort of magnitude. And you can actually see that it went from a triple-digit millions in the June quarter, down to $40 million in the September quarter. It will be significantly reduced here in the December quarter. I'm not saying it will necessarily be de minimis, but it might be. And look, our job is to focus on our core market and the coming back of that. And what we're seeing is our investments in digital health, we've made these last 5 years and how we're the market leader there, have incredibly well set us up for the growth in that.  And so I think as you start to look at modeling ResMed looking at a year-on-year is going to be a very difficult and complex equation, which I'm not sure you'll ever get to the right answer until, even us until the numbers are in on it. What we can look at is Q-on-Q, quarter-on-quarter sequential sleep apnea, COPD, across those devices portfolio, across those masks portfolio, from Q1 to Q2, Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4. We're going to see sequential increase in the sleep devices. We're going to see increase in the sleep and COPD masks and accessories as we go through that quarter. So complex equation, yes, down sort of in the single digits year-on-year in devices, but hugely complex equation with tailwinds and headwinds. Look at Q-on-Q, when you start to see the positive trend of what's happening as we're opening up and as economies are working out how to run digital health and home sleep apnea testing and remote COPD diagnosis and prescriptions for asthma and getting patients on to the platforms like Propeller, like AirView for ventilation, like AirSense 10 and its Air Solutions platform. And that's where we're investing, and that's where, frankly, our technology will win. Operator : Your last question will come from David Low of JPMorgan. David Low : Thought I'd cancel that one. But just one last question. We've got some reports that some of ResMed's masks were in back orders through the quarter. Just wondering if you could talk to that, what might have caused it? How significant it was? And I guess I'm trying to understand whether it was demand driven or whether there was any supply issues there, please? Michael Farrell : Thanks, David. Yes, yes, I believe it was demand driven, as you saw, we had really good numbers in the quarter. But Jim, do you know any details of -- across the sleep business? James Hollingshead : Yes, without trying to go math by math... Michael Farrell : Right. James Hollingshead : Most of the back orders that we faced were demand driven. There were some logistical issues as well in the supply chain. We've had also some domestic shipping issues. Little things here and there that have been an issue, but it's almost all demand driven. Operator : We are now at the 75 minute mark, so I will turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Cheryl, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to take the opportunity here at the end to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom, almost all of whom are shareholders as well for their dedication, hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes who are going to our plants and production plants, our distribution plants, our tech services centers, and actually, because you have to touch physical product not being able to work from home. Thank you for following all safety procedures and doing that really well through this crisis. I look forward to talking to all of our shareholders here in around 90 days. Amy, I hand over to you to close out. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations or to me directly. As previously mentioned, all of the documents, along with the transcript and a replay of our call today will be available on our website later. Cheryl, you may now go ahead and close our call.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Shentel. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. On the call today to discuss our quarterly results are our CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. And several other members of management will be available during the Q&A following our prepared remarks. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks Amy. And thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on today's call. On this our first call for calendar year 2021. We are happy to see the steady growth of production, distribution and availability of vaccines around the world. Clearly, we all want to see faster production and wider distribution so that people can be safe from COVID-19 and free to open up their communities and free to get back to their lives. We continue our work here at ResMed to support frontline respiratory therapists and pulmonary physicians, critical care physicians as well as providers, patients and Resmedian around the 140 plus countries that we operate in. In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma are steadily increasing, modestly improving on the trends we saw in the September 2020 quarter. We're seeing this improvement of patient flow even as second and third waves come through northern winter hemisphere nations, because physicians and providers are adopting digital health, which enables patient engagement, even when people cannot or do not want to meet live and in person. In my remarks today, I will provide a high-level overview of our December Q2, FY21 business results and then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on the financials. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and annual operating priorities. Today, we have published and reported solid, high single digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results once again speak to our ResMed team's ability to work innovatively and deliver results, even when facing lower patient activity and little to no incremental benefit from ventilator sales. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $170 million of cash, allowing us to return over $57 million in dividends to shareholders. We have also grown research and development investments in digital health technology as well as hardware, software and clinical research. We forecast increasing digital health demand from patients from physicians from providers and from healthcare systems as they embrace remote patient monitoring, and they adopt data driven population health management systems. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for our customers with an industry leading IP portfolio including over 6,000 patents and designs. Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences. And to drive lower health care system costs. We now have over 8 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based air solutions platform. We have sold over 13.5 million, 100% Cloud connectable medical devices into the market from ResMed. And we have over 15 million patients enrolled in our AirView Solutions in the cloud. With these data liberated to the cloud, we can unlock value for all of our customer groups. We can unlock value for patients through Maya, we can unlock value for physicians through AirView, and we can unlock value for IDNs payer providers as well as private and government insurance for data driven population health management. That's the future of healthcare. The goals we share with all of our customer are these three. One to improve patient outcomes, patient quality of life, patient chronic disease outcomes. Two, to lower overall healthcare system costs, and three to bend the curve of chronic disease progression. To be clear, the spectrum of chronic diseases that we look at here at ResMed are of course, including our core focus areas of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, but it also includes biological systems interaction with cardiovascular disease, with cancer, with type two diabetes with neuromuscular disease, Alzheimer's and beyond. During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID has continued to accelerate the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world. We are seeing the recognition of the value of Remote Patient screen, virtual diagnoses, Remote Patient Management, and the rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models in many of the nations that we serve patients. As an example of just one of these Germany during the quarter, approved reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices including our digital 3D printed dental sleep apnea product called NARVAL. This is the first time Germany has approved such a product type to treat sleep apnea. In addition, several German states looking at experimenting with digital Health Reimbursement models. These are exciting developments and we expect this will benefit our German business over time. We've also seen other national governments including France, Japan, and the United States, where they've adopted models and taken action to accelerate digital health adoption. Remote healthcare is of incredible importance during this COVID-19 pandemic. But digital health is also valuable well beyond the impact of COVID because it provides better availability of healthcare. It provides excellent quality care for patients, and it provides significantly lower costs for healthcare systems worldwide. These trends are key to ResMed's 2025 strategy. We believe the accelerated adoption of digital Health Solutions represents a significant and permanent shift of the adoption curve for ResMed market leading digital health solutions. Let me now briefly update you on our top three strategic priorities. These three priorities are one to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses. Two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions. And three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends, as well as very strong resupply activity, both of which has supported another quarter of solid revenue growth that you can see in the numbers we just released. Within 70% to 90% of the pre-COVID patient flow coming through our biggest market in the United States. And to take an example of a European country in Germany, we're already back to 85% to 90 plus percent in some states of Germany of pre-COVID patient flow. Even in countries like China, in our large Asia region, where we saw the sharpest declines at the start of this crisis with very severe lockdowns in Asia and particularly in China, we're now back to already seeing around 70 plus percent 70% to 75% of pre-COVID patient flow coming through the mainly hospital clinics in our China market. Obviously, the recovery rates of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy may be impacted by the typical seasonality we see in our largest market here in the United States in the March quarter. As a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of the calendar year this is as per normal. This seasonal impact affects devices more than it affects mask systems, given the relative price points of the two categories, and the fact that the vast majority of mask revenue is returning customers on resupply programs. The resiliency of our mask and accessory resupply has been strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. And we see it as remaining strong through the recovery and strong in a post-COVID Peak world. We continue to produce clinical research showing that diagnosing and treating sleep apnea saves money and improves quality of life for patients. This quarter, we are now showing data that treating sleep apnea is actually a life and death decision. The latest data from the European Respiratory Journal, which published during the quarter results from a 30-year study. The high-level summary of these results were that treating sleep apnea increases patient quality of life and extends quantity of life. It also showed the commerce side in that not trading sleep apnea leads to a significantly higher incidence of heart attack, type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease, leading to significantly higher healthcare costs, treating those diseases and ultimately leading to early death. Let me now turn from sleep apnea to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve COPD, and asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients in our core Respiratory Care markets, including non-invasive ventilation, as well as life support ventilation, as well as newer areas including pharmaceutical, drug delivery, and high-flow therapy. We make the smallest quietest and most comfortable devices on the market. And they are all 100% Cloud connectable. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the peak of the COVID-19 crisis there about nine months ago; we accelerated the time to market to meet the needs of physicians and patients during the COVID peak. And it's proved to be very useful during the peak and beyond the peak. The value being provided for this platform has helped healthcare systems in the markets they operate in, where we ensure we are making digital health part of the standard of care for Respiratory Care, not just in Europe, but worldwide. During the quarter we decided to exit the portable oxygen market and shut down our concentrator business in that category. We entered the POC market in 2016 as a way to engage with stage two and stage three COPD patients. Since then, and these last five years we have acquired Propeller giving us access to COPD patients even earlier in their COPD disease progression, including stage one and stage two COPD patients. Additionally, and especially during COVID, we've seen more rapid adoption of high flow therapy that can support some COPD patients. And of course, we have our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for more severe COPD patients in markets globally already. In short, we don't need POC to help in our end-to-end digital health pathway for COPD. Additionally, given no positive changes to POC reimbursement in the latest round from the US government, and the economics of our customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value, the POC market itself is not as attractive as it was five years ago. The bottom line is this; we have pharmaceutical drug delivery management through Propeller to support COPD patients in stage one and stage two COPD. We have the emergence of high-flow therapy for stage two and stage three COPD. And we have growing use of non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation to support patients in stage three and stage four COPD. So in summary, we are very well positioned to help patients, physicians, providers and payers with an end-to-end digital health management pathway for COPD. Let me now review our software as a service business. During the quarter our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by continued strong uptake of our Brightree HME resupply solutions. Impact of COVID on surgical procedures and other in hospital and out of hospital visits has impacted discharge rates that particularly affect the census at skilled nursing facilities and hospice. On the other hand, the flow of patients in home medical equipment and home health has been recovering well even stronger. So as we look across our portfolio of out of hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health and hospice, life plan communities, private duty home care and senior living, we expect that the weighted average market growth rate of these verticals will be in the low to mid single digit range for fiscal 2021. We expect this weighted average market growth rate portfolio to return to mid-single digits and then to high single digits. As hospital discharge and ambulatory surgery center discharge rates return. Our offerings are very well received in each of the verticals that we serve. So we will not just accept these market growth rates, we will look to meet and beat that group market growth rate as we did this quarter, getting a return from our significant investments in R&D within Brightree and MatrixCare. And through expansion of our partnerships with hospital based electronic health record providers. Brightree continues to innovate to drive resupply growth. Of particular note the integration and scaling of the Snap Technologies is going very well. This has allowed our home medical equipment customers to expand their resupply programs and support more patients with better engagement at a time during the COVID pandemic when they desperately need new innovation both the providers and the patients. MatrixCare has also introduced new technology; we introduce new voice to text technology at the point of care, which helps address caregiver shortages which are right during COVID by enabling better and more efficient workflows for the customer, while also delivering a better experience for the ultimate customer who's the patient. Our expanded relationship with Cerner is progressing very well. We are now Cerner's preferred solution across home health and hospice, as well as her medical equipment and their pharmacy and infusion businesses. Our increasingly important relationship with Cerner is leading to better interoperability for providers and mutual customers and an improved experience for patients. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to sleep apnea and COPD disease management. Clearly, 2020 was an unprecedented year for companies across every industry, and there was much suffering around the world. However, we see some blessings during all that suffering. Importantly, we hear it resonated we were able to be there during the emergency. We were able to pivot our whole team and our home business to provide over 150,000 ventilators during the peak needs of the endemic and get them to where they needed based upon a humanitarian epidemiology model. Additionally, COVID has highlighted the importance of respiratory health. COVID generally kills people through acute respiratory distress syndrome and awful but that has raised the awareness of respiratory hygiene, respiratory health and the field of respiratory medicine. The crisis also showed us the importance of digital health, and has accelerated the awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening for remote patient diagnosis, Remote Patient setup, as well as remote patient monitoring and management. We have seen this crisis drive the importance of healthcare delivered outside the hospital. And that's where ResMed competes to more than 90% of our business. And it's where we add value to customers and where we win. We have seen an ability to bring digital technology that we've been inventing and developing for over a decade, digital screening, digital diagnostics, digital therapeutics, and digital health management of patients. With over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater and greater adoption of these scalable technologies. We are poised to continue relentless innovation and development, as well as to provide the global scale that's needed to drive this technology to the 140 countries that we operate in and beyond. Before I hand the coal over to Brett for his remarks, and then we get to the Q&A, I want to once again express my sincere genuine gratitude to the more than 7,500 ResMedians whose perseverance, hard work and dedication during the incredibly challenging circumstances for 2020 allowed our partners in healthcare to save the lives of many hundreds of 1000s of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation, literally giving the gift of breath and the gift of life to many during COVID. I also thank you for the rapid pivot back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and all those who need world class care delivered well away from the hospital, and preferably in their own time. Thank you. With that I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move to Q&A. Brett? Brett Sandercock : Right. Thanks Nick. Norman. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter fiscal year 2021. And some remarks on our FY21 second half outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior quarter. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Total revenue for the December quarter was $800 million, an increase of 9% than the prior quarter, and in constant currency terms revenue increased by 7%. Consistent with our predictions in Q1 earnings call, we derive minimal incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the December quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were $427 million, an increase of 5%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $291 million; increases of 17% were in constant currency terms and increase of 10%. By product segment, US, Canada and Latin America device sales were $205 million, an increase in 1%. Masks and others sales were $222 million, an increase of 8%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales total $188 million, an increase of 16%. When in constant currency terms a 10% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $93 million, an increase 18% when in constant currency terms and increase of 12%. Globally in constant currency term, device sales increased by 5%, while mask and other sales increased by 9%. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6%. On non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 5%. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment that makes it clear deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 20 basis points to 59.9% in the December quarter compared to 59.7% in the same quarter last. The increase is predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product exchanges and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $169 million, a decrease of 1%. On a constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 3%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 21.2% compared to the 23.3% recorded in the prior quarter. Benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward with SG&A expenses in the second half of FY21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 10% or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to 6.8% in the prior year. We continue to provide for further investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solution development will deliver sustained and competitive advantage. Looking forward we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in a high single digit reflecting this commitment to innovation. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $15 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $254 million, an increase of 16% reflecting strong top-line growth, expansion of gross margin, and well contained operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.8%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $206 million, an increase of 17%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.41, also a 17% increase. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23. During the December quarter, we closed our portable oxygen concentrator business. We recognized that restructuring expenses of $13.9 million associated with the closure. Going forward the cessation of the POC business will have an immaterial impact on both group revenue and earnings per share. We did not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future. And we have adjusted for this one-time expense within our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $170 million reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $35 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter total $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.6 in our income statement in the December quarter associated with Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $5million per quarter in the second half of FY21 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $256 million. At December 31, we had $826 million in gross debt and $570 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At December 31, we had a further $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our total cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We've focused on paying down debt as well as ensuring we have cash reserves to support the company through the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest to grow through R&D. We will also likely deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Snap which we completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. We intend to continue returning cash to shareholders through our dividend program and we might also resume our share buyback program some time during the calendar year. This program has been on par since our acquisition of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal 2019. Turning now to our FY21 outlook. At a high level, we are now seeing a negligible COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in the second half of FY21.Q2. Note as a reminder we recorded $35 million in COVID generated ventilator revenue in our March quarter last year. And $125 million COVID generated ventilator revenue in our June quarter last year. Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 12 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of our resupply service offering. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask sales in the second half of FY21. Notwithstanding continued COVID-19 challenges, we continue to expect the sequential increase in new sleep patients that should support our devices as we move through the second half of FY21. However, we typically experienced a small seasonal sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3, largely attributable to reset of deductibles and health insurance plans in our US market. We expect this trend will also be apparent in FY21. Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, including the potential disruptive impacts of ongoing restrictions imposed in many of the countries we operate in. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I'll hand call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great, thank you, Brett. And thank you, Mick. Shentel, let's now go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. MargaretKaczor: Hey, good afternoon, and good morning to you, Mick. Thanks for taking the questions. And maybe the first one for me as to hit it off. You guys mentioned that there were negligible vent sales this quarter. So does that imply that this is a good revenue base for our model to grow off of for that coarsely business? And the reason I ask is, if it does, and then sales went from $40 million last quarter, none this quarter actually does imply that the business is doing quite well. So any details would be great. Thanks Mick. MickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Margaret. And yes, clearly in the December quarter, we had as we predicted sort of the minimis ventilator sales a little bit in Northern Europe, perhaps, but not material across the group. And as Brett said in the remarks just now from him, and I said as well, we expect no sort of COVID related than later sales throughout the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. People have enough in the hospitals, which is great. And so yes, look, it does start to form a good a good base, when you look at the core business of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. I mean, as we said, the seasonality, usually from Q2, December quarter to Q3 March quarter relating to the US market and deductibles, and so on. But for the other 139 countries we're in and across the portfolio, so it's a good base to start to, to get that slow and steady improvement in the patient flow in this new digital health driven world, Margaret. Our patients going to primary care on zoom and telemedicine and getting referrals to their specialists and coming through the pipeline. And so we think it's better for the long term, but it is slowly and steadily coming back from advice. And yes, as we said, sort of in those numbers of the percentage flow patients as best we can see it. We saw improvement from September to December. And so those in takings up vent sales over that 90-day period as well. Operator : Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie. DavidBailey: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. I'm just interested in actually what you've seen adherence levels over COVID-19, whether you've seen it pick up over the last sort of calendar year? And an extension of that any sort of relationship that you've been able to gather from in between resupply and adherence level? Any comments there would be interesting. MickFarrell: Yes, it's interesting. And we certainly think sort of modest, sort of single digit improvements in overall adherence, as we look at the big data, and we're actually doing a whole bunch of research on this to understand the sort of kinetics and dynamics of COVID-19 on the market. I think really early stage instead of March, April, people, there was a lot of things going around, and maybe using a CPAP would bring more virus in the room if you have other people room. So some fear and uncertainty and doubt in that early period. But I think that was all covered over by doctors saying listen, if you get treated for sleep apnea, it's actually preventative and improving your lungs and lower impact and severity of COVID-19. And again, look, there's so much clinical literature out there in terms of the general press, but through the scientific data, we are able to see people are adhering, those who are adhering more and sleeping more and using the devices more. And David, to your point, they're participating more in those resupply programs; they are seeing the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. And when they get a text response, or an app click and a chance to say yes, I want that new mask, I want that new tubing, I want that new humidifier, they putting it at much higher rates and getting closer to, frankly, what they should have always done, which is keeping respiratory hygiene at top of mind. So I would say modest improvements in overall adherence and more significant improvements in the probability that a person says, who is adherent says, I want to get that mask with that copay. I want to get that mask now to get resupply and in cash markets, same thing as well. So it's a really good question, David. It's a complex equation. We're working through all the variables, but yes, modest improvement in adherence and really good improvement in mask resupply as you saw in the numbers, as well as you saw in the health of the patients. Operator : Your next question comes from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America. LyanneHarrison: Good morning and congrats. Just a question. I'm trying to understand the change in these charts, I guess the recovery rate to create a few key markets do not appear to have yet improved much compared to the rates you quoted at the last result call. Can you give us some color on what you're hearing in relation to the pipeline in particular physicians' access in sleep testing, whether it being in the level at home to our key markets particularly as COVID cases staged in November and December? MickFarrell: Lyanne, it's a good question. And like David's, it's complex, because there's 140 countries all adopting digital health at different rates, and all having different sort of national rules around retail and restaurants as well as how you get back to life and back to health care as well. Healthcare has proved pretty resilient, I think, because people know, it's an essential industry. And the data that I shared earlier around truly life and death decision of using your CPAP or not for treating sleep apnea. I mean, it's incredible to have those data in the hands of our physicians worldwide as they are driving adherence. It's one thing to be doing a digital telemedicine call with a patient over a zoom or secure network, it's another one to say, listen, using this device will save your life, as well as improve your quality of life. And so the numbers of plus or minus 10% anyway, and that's why the ranges are so broad. But look, here the US key market is somewhere between 70 to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow as best we can measure it by at the link air usage by essence 10 sort of air solutions, activations of new devices and reactivations of resupply devices. And it's not perfect data. And it's different in all the 50 states just in the country that I'm living in here, between California, Massachusetts, and Florida, very different areas of opening up of their whole economies on local and state regulation. But that range is pretty broad, but it's pretty accurate in terms of the patient flow through. And that's why I think you've seen people really participating in masks and accessory resupply programs, but a slowdown, obviously a new patient starts. And as you pointed out the kinetics of it. Yes, true from the September quarter, I think we moved up sort of somewhere between 5% and 10% in each of the key markets, I talked about US, China and Germany as examples for Americas, Europe and Asia. So that's 5%, 10% 500 basis points, plus improvement in the quarter it's not this V shape, we're back to 100%, December 2019. Again, but it's a slow, steady sort of U-shaped improvement in the flow of patients, which we think does then over time flow through with all the systems and all the restrictions and portfolio of 140 countries through to patients getting set up and started on a lifetime of therapy on sleep apnea or COPD therapy. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS. SaulHadassin: Good afternoon, Mick. Good morning, Brett. And say good afternoon Amy as well. Just a quick question on rest of the world sales, Mick, ex-US sales. So strong growth rates, both the costs for generators and masks, just wondering if you can give a bit more color, if sleep therapies are still sort of recovering back to you said 85% - 90% in some regions, just what else drove that very strong growth rate across those two product categories? And was there any tender timing for example, in Asia Pac that may be contributed to that strong growth rate? MickFarrell: Thank you, thanks for the question. So I'll have a little bit of a go at it. And then hand to Rob Douglas, our COO beside me here to provide more detail. Look as I said, there was some modest sales of ventilators in western and northern Europe during the quarter that'll flow into the devices number at plus 10% constant currency, and then the masks at plus 12% constant currency. Again, this is Europe, Asia, and the whole entire rest of worlds, and so we're talking 135 plus countries. And so, Rob, do you want to have a go at summarizing that is for sale singly. RobDouglas: Yes, let's just cross off the last point, Saul, I saw that there wasn't any kind of changes or issues in any of those markets, particularly. But across the board it was really interesting. We sort of had strong performance in many, many countries. Usually the countries are wary and some are strong and some aren't so on a given time, but it looked like there was pretty good strong performance. And we think the same underlying fundamentals that we've talked about, particularly in the US market. We're applying at different scales on these markets. And so in many small markets, we saw the uptake of that digital solutions being really strong. And in fact that underpinning that in our own technology base. In fact, actually a really good performance for that. Our technology team is meeting those digital requirements in each of the different countries as well. And then it was just really sort of patient demand for making sure their treatment is up to scratch. Really good, and we saw that dynamics across the board. The whole issue of the resurgence didn't seem to have quite effected that you might have thought because I think the health systems have learn that they actually didn't need to shut down everything in the health system and they knew what they can keep open. And so then the sort of the diagnosis processes and that kept going on. As Mick said before, things aren't yet back to fully open and normal. But the whole system's striving to get there. And additional things that have taken home sleep testing in some markets have been supportive as well. So it's really our whole suite of solutions is supporting a market that needs to treat these patients if it is going. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. MatthewMishan: Hey, great, and thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, just a quick one for me, just what is the pushback, what is the pushback from the payer community on closing the gap and reimbursement between at home sleep testing and lab-based tests? MickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Matt. I think the payer community and it varies. Take the example of the United States where it's probably 25% government reimbursement and 75% if you like in our sleep PAP but seems like sleep apnea sales of private payers, they were very supportive of both in lab and in home with apnea testing. And if you look at this country pre-COVID was probably about 45% home sleep apnea testing versus 55% in lab. I think that's moved up very significantly during COVID. Obviously, during the peak of the lockdowns it went very high. And it will probably level out somewhere in that 50%, 55%, 60% range of the diagnoses being home sleep apnea testing. Plus often have deltas of anything you can vary from $250 for home sleep apnea test and $750 - $800 for in lab test, just relative to the cost over there. Obviously, for the payer they would want if it's clinically equivalent patient and good sensitivity, specificity of the data and good patient outcomes, and patient satisfaction as well the payers care about, they would flow towards home sleep apnea testing, where they can go. But look I'll hand over David Pendarvis to add any further color on that dynamic. DavidPendarvis: Yes, Matt, at least in the US there actually are some pretty straightforward dollar investment and time requirements that go into reimbursement for a lot of payers. And the fact of the matter is, PHP equipments a lot more expensive to purchase, more expensive to operate, and it takes more time from both the physician and the facility. So that's what they're looking at more so than necessarily the incentives that are driven by the lower cost of home sleep testing. And the higher reimbursement rate of PSG. We certainly support good PSG when it's appropriate for the patient, and there's a lot of sleep labs that have invested a lot of capital, they invest a lot of time for their staff in that. And it's important that they be reimbursed adequately. So they both have their place in the market. But I think it's generally those sorts of things that go into their reimbursement decisions, not necessarily what outcomes are they trying to drive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall of MST Macquarie. AndrewGoodsall: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just looking at your margins, obviously, mask growth outpaced flow generated. So I can say it's a mixed effect. Could you sort of talk to that mix effect, but also expand on your comments on average selling price decline? MickFarrell: Brett, let's see it. BrettSandercock: Yes, thank you. Sure. Thanks Mick. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, I mean, we had if you look through the year-on-year 20 basis point expansion. So it was kind of a moderate expansion. So those moving parts that I talked about and those impacts are pretty much or pretty small overall. The mix, pretty much they kind of had that strong mask crisis it's going to underpin that product mix. If you look that, year-on-year little bit of benefit from some effects but pretty minor. And then on ASPs, again, it's I'd characterize a pretty benign environment from a pricing perspective, and that's probably reflected in that pretty small movements in the gross margin year-on-year. AndrewGoodsall: So the ASPs are pretty modest but you flagged that and - BrettSandercock: Yes, [Multiple Speakers] historic context. I think it's a pretty benign environment for us relative to historical trends. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley. SeanLaaman: Thank you and good morning, Mick. I have a question on the exit of the PIC business. If I get this right, and I think I've got it simplistically right, but please correct me that you think you've got those mid stage COPD patients covered already through non-invasive events, and there's better reimbursement. And maybe there's a better clinical outcome. But we consider any sort of change in the thinking about how the funnel might operate to get to those patients and service and with non-invasive events with Propeller. Thanks Mick. MickFarrell: Yes, Sean, it's a great question. And yes, you're right, look at what Propeller that acquisition is about 24 months old so that what that allowed us to do is to get to patients much earlier in the COPD development cycle. It's really stage one, COPD, where you have that shortness of breath, climbing a flight of stairs, and you go to see the primary care diagnosis and find out that you do have some lung dysfunction. And this broad category called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; you get put in that bucket. And there are many different types of therapies that the doctor can go to, but a lot of them are those pharmaceutical therapies up front. And those inhalers are not used as prescribed when they just given a prescription. The sign is when a pill is prescribed for high cholesterol or low blood pressure the adherence rates are very low in the general population 50% plus or minus. And with Propeller Health we are able to drive those adherence rates up double digits on a relative basis and drive to incredible adherence rates that the pharma industry just hasn't seen in respiratory medicine. And so Propeller technology is really exciting. It's really new. We have major global pharmaceutical companies partnering with us in major markets driving that. Early days but we think that allows us to get to stage one stage two patients in a very significant, scalable way to get them on that sort of end-to-end, digital health journey in COPD. As they progress to stage two, stage three, they sometimes get prescriptions for high-flow therapy, oxygen and ventilation, right. And so with it with non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, which is really stage three, stage four, and in that sort of crossover phase from the pharmaceuticals to the ventilator, both oxygen and high flow therapy used. High-flow therapy is newer and more scaling. And we think more related to our core business and the core devices we make. And it allows us to treat the patients and take care of the patients. And so PSC just became an additional one that wasn't as important in that end-to-end journey, and certainly didn't have the sort of margin profile or the growth profile with the changes in reimbursement to allow us to have the same growth opportunity that we have in non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation. So that's sort of it in a nutshell. Operator : Your next question comes from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. GretelJanu: Thanks very much. Can you talk a bit more about the future pricing environment in the US? I know you said it's the benign currently. But and of course, we did have the announcement of 2 key DMEs merging could you expect great ASP price declines going forward in this benign environment that you're currently in? MickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Gretel. I'll hand that to the President of our Global Sleep and Respiratory Care Business. Jim, over to you. JamesHollings: Sorry, can you hear me now? It's a terrible way to enter the call. Thank you for the question. Thanks, Mick. I think that what we've seen this year is benign is maybe too softer word for price. But I'll go with benign. We've had a pretty stable pricing environment; I think in anticipation of - the market was anticipating the competitive bid rates. And then of course, competitive bid got delayed. And obviously, the Adapt Health acquisition of Arikare creates an even larger customer for us; they're very important customer for us. And we enjoy a very good relationship with them. I think both with that move. And then with ongoing trends into the year, we should see something that looks like more normal pricing environment, I think, in the second half of the fiscal year and going forward. And it'll be a little bit different by market as it always is, but I would expect it to be kind of back in a more normal trend. Operator : Your next question comes from David Low of J.P. Morgan. DavidLow: Thanks very much. Look, my question is on the software business, Mick, I think you commented that Brightree delivered most of the growth, MatrixCare et cetera, facing more of a challenge from the pandemic. Can you elaborate a little bit and how much growth did you see through Brightree? And what's driving that and I guess most importantly, can we maintain that growth in that part of the software business? MickFarrell: Yes, thanks for the question. David, and clearly Brightree had strong growth driven by the strength of our home medical equipment, customers and their ability to pivot their businesses to mask and resupply, and the great adoption of Brightree resupply sort of our core resupply software there. But also the Snap Technologies acquisition that we closed almost exactly a year ago, we were doing due diligence a year ago and closed it sort of later on during this March quarter. And so those two technologies have been very well adopted. But look, in addition to that our Brightree team it's a significant double-digit percent of their revenues in R&D, they've delivered a whole bunch of innovation, some COVID related management opportunities for their HME customers, as well as other innovative ways to grow their business. And so that's allowed the Brightree business to support HMEs and really help them survive and thrive in the early stages, and later stages of COVID-19. And it's great help to the industry. And I'm really proud that ResMed and Brightree are able to deliver that. On the MatrixCare side, yes, it's a tougher story, because the verticals that they operate in will more severely affected skilled nursing facility, census was down high double digits the peak of the crisis and still is down year-on-year on the number of patients in skilled nursing facility operations, and that impacts MatrixCare census rights and ability to grow. In addition, hospice affected similarly, on the other hand home health has been a growth light within the MatrixCare area, and the addition of our MatrixCare branded, but it's healthcare first Brightree and MatrixCare technologies, all combined under the MatrixCare brand has been growing really well. And the Glen and his team who is the VP who's driving that has seen incredible growth in home health and hospice. And I think if you look across that portfolio, what sort of a guy that we deal with because it's you can go through all the verticals in detail is that we think that weighted average market growth rate is needed to have loading in single digits right now. You saw we grew 6% in the quarter. So we're growing a little bit ahead of market taking a little - some of those verticals. But as the weighted average market growth rate goes to mid-single digits, we're going to look to meet and do that. And then when it gets back to high single digits, as the flow of patients from hospitals, and ambulatory surgery centers, picks up, we will then see skilled nursing facilities, hospice and all the verticals, pick up their census rights and get us back to those sorts of growth rates and beyond the time. So, David, it's really sort of part related to the whole recovery of the economy, and that really related to the hospital what people are calling elective surgeries. And I think if you need a heart valve, or a new hip, it's hardly elective when the pain or the probability of death starts going up. And I think healthcare systems are really starting to address that and get their patients back into care. So we should start to see those recoveries over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Matson of Needham and Co. MichaelMatson: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted asked about the decision to exit the PSC market. You made some comments on that in the prepared remarks, but I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. I guess what I'm wondering is, was this really a marketing issue? Do you think that the markets just not attractive or the margins on the products too low relative to their other products? Was the product that you had to kind of start with just not competitive enough? Or were there other reasons for exiting this market? I guess what I'm getting at was this a product issue or market issue or both? MickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Mike. Like I'll - I said, what I said in the prepared remarks and the question before, maybe I'll hand to Jim Hollings for any further detail. I mean we have the end-to-end play with all that we have in, our core capabilities of Propeller, high-flow therapy, non-invasive ventilation and lots of ventilation. But Jim any further detail you want to share from Mike. JamesHollings: Yes. Thanks, Mick. And thanks Mike. I think Mike, and for balancing sort of market versus our portfolios the way I would frame it, I think it's a little bit of both. So if you look at the market, we've thought for a long time that POCs should be reimbursed in a better way than a differential way because they create a lot of value for patients, they allow patients to be mobile and to get out about which is actually better for the care. But especially in the US market reimbursements always been upside down sort of unfavorable to POCs versus stationary. And we enter the category knowing that and we're innovating and we actually feel really good about the product. We had been developing the product, we had a market and the next generation that we were developing, but then you see how reimbursement is not changed and in fact has become less favorable and in relative terms of categories are just not that attractive, right. It doesn't have the same growth that it had five years ago when we enter it as a category, and that sort of thing. And then when you take that line of business and compare it to our overall portfolio in the sleep and respiratory care business, in relative terms, it's not nearly as strong a profile as the other opportunities, we have to invest in innovation, right? So we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to invest in Propeller or health, a fantastic opportunity, it's early days, but a fantastic opportunity to invest in high-flow therapy, which we think has a really interesting clinical profile and could be of great benefit to patients. And then, of course, as we continue to grow our digital offerings, our R&D portfolio there is just plenty of places for us to put R&D into other digital offerings in the expansion of our digital offerings. And so there's both the question of looking at the market and where that category had evolved since we'd entered with that acquisition, but also just looking at the range of opportunities we have in hand and making a decision to invest in things that we think afford more attractive, both for ResMed shareholders and also for patients. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs. ChrisCooper: Hi, morning and afternoon. Thank you. Most of my near 10 questions have been asked. So just given there's been lots of references to high-flow therapy, today, I guess it would be remiss of me not to just ask you guys for a bit more of a sort of comprehensive update on where you're positioned. And what your strategy is there. I mean, did you guys have what you need in terms of current portfolio or are there some areas that might make sense from sort of a tuck-in perspective? And just generally, I guess your views on market growth and how you fit within that over the quarters and years ahead. I mean the references you made today are indicative clearly of how increasingly important this therapy looks and embrace this therapy markets but that just been keen to get some sense of quantification from you that would be helpful, if that would be possible. Thank you. MickFarrell: Thanks for your question, Chris. And look, it's a really exciting new area for us, obviously, with further down the road on Propeller Health and it's starting to move into stage one stage two area. During COVID-19, there were uses of high-flow therapy for patients with low oxygen and it's always been an area that has been looked at. We're interested in, ResMed's 90% of our revenues are in the home, we're really interested in home care, and the idea of high-flow therapy in the home we think has a lot of future. There's not a lot of reimbursement, in fact, virtually zero anywhere around the world. So it's a new development area. But we think, given some of the clinical data that are coming out, and some of the research we're doing with providers around the world, there is an opportunity to get patients out of the hospital and into the home with high-flow therapy treatment, and as a stepping stone on the pathway to our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators and in combination with our drug delivery system. So it's very early days, Chris, not at all material to our business, but it provides that sort of bridge portfolio, if you like, from Propeller through to the ventilation side, and we think was validated somewhat during COVID-19. And some clinical data that we are working with people with around the world says that as we look towards 2025, we think this will be a good part of our homecare portfolio of taking care of patients with high-flow therapy. ChrisCooper: And just a very brief follow up, Mick. So for the homecare opportunity to really manifest in the way you expect do you need reimbursement to become more supportive? Or do you think that the current arrangements would allow that to happen? MickFarrell: No, Chris, I think we'd want to see our reimbursement models developed because that's how change happens, right? I mean, it's both the Hippocratic Oath and Adam Smith, if you like that are required to move some areas of healthcare. We've seen that in digital health where we had amazing solutions for over a decade in the field of liberating data to the cloud and driving up adherence and so on. But it was when we started to see models in the US and France and Japan and now Germany, where digital health started to be reimbursed because it is providing care that is of value and then reflecting that for the doctors and the providers and reimbursing in that. So I think reimbursement is a very important part of developing the home care market for high-flow therapy. So obviously, our research and partnerships with payers, providers and IDNs will be along those lines. Operator : Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer. SurajKalia: Good afternoon. Can you hear me all right? Perfect. So Mick a couple of subpart questions related to COVID. Are you seeing any COVID related shifts in the mask replacement cycle now these transients are relatively stickier in nature, and if I could, has COVID identified any manufacturing, location re-optimization that would help you all realize incremental margin gains over the next few years? Thank you for taking my questions. MickFarrell: Thanks, Suraj. I'll hand the first question to Jim around replacement rates around masks during COVID and stickiness of that beyond. And then the second part around global manufacturing to Rob Douglas. So Jim you first? JamesHollings: Sure. Thanks, Mick thanks Suraj. On mask replacement, I think, what we've seen all year during the pandemic is a couple and we've talked about this, I think on this call, before we've seen a couple of dynamics. The first one is I do think patients are just more attentive to the idea that their equipment might be older, I think there's a greater sensitivity and awareness on behalf of patients to sort of have clean and disinfected reading apparatus, right? I mean, so I think that's driven a bit of incremental demand. And it's an open question as to how persistent and will be, but I would think it's going to be a bit more persistent. I think you'll see patients just more attentive to cleaning their masks and their tubes, and resupply and on a regular cadence. But that's speculation, and you certainly seen it this year. I don't know how long that will continue, or if it will increase and so on. I think the other thing that, of course, has been happening is in the markets where resupply is a benefit, which is largely the US market or other markets where it is for the provider, but the US market, I think HME customers have been, if anything more focused on driving the supply as a part of the business to patients. And so that's been a marriage of two trends where the HME wants to pay attention to the supply, as new patient starts have been slower, and the patient wants the equipment. And I think that behind that, in addition to behind that we've had increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms, including our offerings there. So I think all three of those trends have led to higher resupply overall. And I think it probably will persist, but it's very difficult to predict as all things COVID are. RobDouglas: Yes, and Suraj to your question on the manufacturing impact, the whole issue around COVID been very challenging for supply chains, and freight trains, all over the world, for many, many companies. And I think like many companies, we are carefully looking at the resilience of our supply chain through there. There are other issues going on around politics and trade relationships that we've got to work. Some of these are going to be beneficial as you talk about margins and some of the headwinds. And I think as we continue to scale our business, we should be able to run faster than those headwinds over time. Operator : We are now at the end of the scheduled time for the call. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Shentel. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on today's call. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, almost all of them are our shareholders for their dedication and hard work helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside the hospital in over 140 countries. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines, production, distribution, tech service, customer service, talking to customers and delivering product every day. I look forward to talking with all of our stakeholders here again in 90 days. Thank you, Amy, over to you. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick. And thank you all again for joining us today. I know we weren't able to get to all the questions in the queue. So please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly if you've got anything further. And as previously mentioned, all the documents along with the transcript and a replay of today's call will be available on our website later today. Shentel, you may now go ahead and close out the call. Operator : This concludes ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Celin. Hello, everyone and welcome to ResMed's third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. We appreciate you joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings release and presentation, both of which are available now. With me on the call today are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion following our prepared remarks. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or in the appendix of the earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks Amy. And thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review result of the March quarter, the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021. On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q3 business metrics. And then I'll hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. I will review progress towards ResMed 2025 strategic goals including execution highlights against our quarterly and our annual operating priorities. A year ago, today when we discussed our March 2020 results, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of business particularly in the United States had not yet been significantly impacted. However, outside the U.S., countries including China and Italy were already in the midst of emergency needs. We quickly mobilize our supply-chain and global operations to address and support ventilation needs world-wide, producing other 150,000 ventilators. We accelerate the production and distribution of noninvasive and life support ventilators in mask systems to those in need, resulting in an incremental $35 million of COVID related revenue during the March 2020 quarter. I'm incredibly proud of how we quickly pivoted business to meet that need, providing life citing solutions around the world, so that healthcare systems were prepared with the resources needed to treat patients who are fighting COVID-19. Today, one year later, the countries we operate in are various different stages of the post COVID peak recovery process in terms of getting to normal patient flow. We see a range of from 70% of pre-COVID patient flow in some countries, up to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow in other countries. Vaccines are steadily rolling out in the United States, the U.K. and many other countries worldwide. We still see significant impacts from ongoing second, third and fourth waves infection in some countries in Europe, as well as in South America and Asia. And especially right now, in the country of Brazil and particularly India. Our team is working with hospitals and healthcare providers in those two countries and beyond for preservation of life, making sure that they have ventilators, masks and the training that they need to use them. We continue to support the frontline respiratory therapists and the physicians who are there on the ground, as well as providers, patients and ResMedians throughout their 140 plus countries that we operate in. Were pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing and getting new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients diagnosed, excluding the $35 million of COVID related ventilator sales in the March 2020 quarter, our team delivered positive sales growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business this quarter on both the headline and constant currency basis. We forecast a steady improvement trend of patient flow for sleep apnea and COPD and asthma continuing as we move through 2021 and into 2022. We expect this progress to accelerate as global vaccination rates continue. We are encouraged to see that patients, physicians and providers around the world are adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, home-based testing, remote patient monitoring, and ongoing patient management. I'd like to be clear that the ventilation sales that we made in 2020 will be part of our comparables for the next two quarters. In the June 2020 quarter, we recognize $125 million in COVID related ventilator sales. And in September 2020 quarter, we recognized $40 million in such revenue. Over the coming quarters we expect to continue to show strong positive year-over-year revenue growth excluding these onetime sales from 2020. As we look further forward, we see a clear path to double digit revenue growth in the back half of our fiscal year 2022 across our full business, powered by opening economies and our pipeline of new technology and innovation. Our headline results were impacted this quarter by an accounting reserves. We talk in connection with discussions with the Australian Tax Office or ATR regarding their ongoing order getting back to fiscal year 2009. Brett has been leading those discussions and we'll speak to the details in his remarks. I will make this statement, ResMed pay significant taxes in countries around the world and we operate in over 140 countries helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives well away from the hospital. Brett and his team are working towards a final resolution of these transfer pricing discussions turning back over 12 years with the ATR. So we have taken this $255 million reserve. We believe that resolving these discussions is the pragmatic thing to do for all of our stakeholders, so that we can put this behind us and focus all of our efforts on our core mission of improving lives in respiratory medicine around the world. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $196 million in operating cash, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders. We also increased our R&D investments in the period in digital health technology, as well as R&D for hardware, embedded software and clinical research, while maintaining financial discipline with reduced SG&A and other operating costs. We are seeing increased demand for our digital health solutions from patients, physicians, providers and healthcare systems around the world as they embrace remote patient engagement and adopt population health management. We are the clear leader in this field with over 14 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. And our ongoing and increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure we provide superior value to patients, physicians and providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted. We fight for it every day through innovation. Our digital technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long term value with an industry leading IP portfolio including over 8000 patents and designs. We now have over 8.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud based platform called air solutions. We have over 15.5 patients enrolled in our cloud based AirView software solution. And we also have over 105 million patients manage within our software as a service network for out-of-hospital healthcare. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customers, patients, physicians, providers, as well as private and government payers. Let me take a few minutes to share some recent clinical highlights that show how we are working with researchers to advance the field of sleep and respiratory medicine with these data and beyond. During 2020, an important 30-year duration study was published in the European respiratory journal following over 4,500 diagnosed OSA patients to better understand the long term impacts of untreated sleep apnea. The study showed that untreated sleep apnea leads to high incidence of myocardial infarction or heart attack, high incidence and prevalence of Type II diabetes and high incidence of ischemic heart disease. This real world clinical analysis is showing what we've known for over three decades. Sleep apnea is a public health epidemic that simply can't be ignored. In terms of clinical quality of life improvement from CPAP therapy, the data are also clear. In late 2019, the multicenter randomized controlled trial called MERGE was published in the journal, Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The results were that patients randomized to CPAP demonstrated clear improvement in quality of life for CPAP patients versus standard of care with symptomatic benefits, including reductions in sleepiness, as well as improvements in fatigue, and importantly, depression, a key part of mental health. Importantly, these results were evident in both mild as well as moderate and severe sleep apnea. In terms of economic data, and a dose response relationship from CPAP therapy, the data are also unequivocal. In 2019, a study was published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, showing the quantified dose response relationship from CPAP therapy. So, for every additional hour of Positive Airway Pressure use, there was an 8% decrease in hospital inpatient visits, and a 4% decrease in overall physician visits. In other words, treating sleep apnea without sleep therapy not only improves lives, it also saves money for the healthcare system by lowering total healthcare utilization costs. During the quarter, we saw the publication of a draft technology assessment from the Agency for Healthcare, Research and Quality, or AHRQ here in the U.S. market. AHRQ sought input and ResMed file public comments, along with comments from many physician groups, sleep apnea patient advocates, provider groups, and beyond. I won't repeat all the details of those public comments, but I will say this, we presented peer reviewed and published data showing that CPAP therapy improves quality of life, reduces healthcare costs, and even reduces mortality. In short, these data prove that in partnership with our physician and provider colleagues in the market, we are saving lives and saving money for the healthcare system through our medical technology. We have peer reviewed and published data showing that a reduction in incidence of heart attack, a reduction in hypertension, as well as a reduction in the incidence of solid cell cancer tumors. All of these are logical sequelae of the elimination of hypoxia that is associated with CPAP therapy in treated sleep apnea patients. We are encouraged by technical studies completed by the National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness. The acronym is nice in the U.K. Just last month NICE may publish there 2021 draft guidelines that recommend that CPAP therapy along with telemonitoring is the frontline treatment option for patients with mild OSA. That would be an expansion of coverage in the U.K., and also an expansion of the use of digital health technology in that market. Similarly, the ministries of health in France, Germany and Japan have seen the value of digital health in sleep apnea therapy and have begun investing reimbursement funds in the space. It's great to see this expansion of coverage for sleep apnea therapy and digital health around the world as government see improvement in outcomes and reductions in total healthcare system costs with this technology. While we respect the work of AHRQ, we, along with many other academic research focus institutes and practicing physician groups believe that they bypass a generation of data in real world evidence that needs to be taken into account along with their own select group of RCTs in the draft report. We are optimistic that the final report when issued we'll reflect the preponderance of real world evidence and broader RCTs showing both the clinical and economic benefits of treating sleep apnea with positive airway pressure. Okay, let me now update you on our top three, ResMed strategic priorities. These are, one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma businesses. Two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices, as well as globally scalable digital health solutions. And three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in a person's home. In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends, as we seek to provide solutions for the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night. The rate of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy in the U.S. was impacted by the typical seasonality that we see in the March quarter, primarily as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of each calendar year. This season, in fact, affects devices more than mask systems, given the incremental cost of diagnosis and the relative price points of the two categories. We expect sequential growth in sleep and respiratory care as we move past this typical seasonality. We continue to see strong ongoing mask and accessory resupply in the U.S. market and beyond. New patient flow during the quarter was impacted by the recent COVID related case surges in select countries in Asia and Europe, including two large markets France and Germany. We see that impact the number of patients going for clinical based diagnosis pathways in these affected countries. We expect to see these markets reopen along with hospitals, as vaccines continue to roll out, and as we see further scaling of the remote home-based diagnostic capacity. Clearly the kinetics of opening of these economies and the rate of vaccination rollout are beyond our control. However, we can control our investments in digital solutions for our physician and provider partners, which we are doing at increasing velocity and with scalable systems and processes. More broadly, we are seeing growth in total sleep -- total new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. And we expect to see this improve over time in our portfolio of 140 country markets each quarter. Importantly, our market leading share position has remained stable across both masks and devices. And we're excited about our future pipeline. We rarely talk about our future pipeline as those who've followed us for very time now. But today I would like to open up the curtain just a little bit on our next generation sleep apnea platform. You may have seen some recent U.S. regulatory filings that we made for our next generation, flow generator platform called the AirSense 11. Clearly, there are multiple steps in the process to bring this new platform to global markets and these public regulatory filings are simply one important step. But we are making good progress. Earlier this month, we started a limited controlled product launch of the AirSense 11 in certain parts of the United States. We expect to move to a broader commercial launch of the platform later this calendar year in the U.S. and then to country markets worldwide in sequence after that. For now I can say that as a personal user of our CPAP therapy, I have firsthand knowledge that the AirSense 11 device will benefit patients and their bed partners. And our early data show that the device and software platform combination will benefit physicians, providers, payers and beyond, and ultimately continue to catalyze ResMed's global leadership in digital health solutions for sleep apnea and then also accelerate our success in digital health solutions for COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. We make the smallest, quietest, smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. Importantly, they are all cloud connectable with the latest and greatest digital health technology to increase adherence, improve clinical outcomes, and deliver proven cost reductions within our customers on health care systems. Let me turn now to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 340 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients with our core respiratory care solutions including both non invasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drugs delivery devices and high flow therapy devices. Our respiratory care business benefited in the March 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilator devices and ventilation mask solutions to meet growing demand worldwide as a result of the pandemic. During the March 2021 quarter COVID related ventilator sales were not material to the global business. However, we are seeing some demand in select countries affected by these latest COVID surges, such as just this month with the surge in India. And we're getting many 1000s of devices to those in need, the demand is there in that country. But as in Q3, we do not expect the revenue to be material to our global business. Even though the broader impact particularly with preservation in life in these countries is clearly priceless, and incredibly important to not only our local team in India, but to all of us here at ResMed worldwide. Demand for our core non invasive ventilator and life support ventilator solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as in sleep apnea. We are balancing the growth in patient demand there with the supply of ventilators that we made to the market throughout 2020 as customers balance their inventory and their core ongoing patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the pandemic this time a year ago. We are now seeing that this technology has expanded to regions around the world. The value being provided through this cloud-based software solution has been fruitful not only during the COVID pandemic and the peak parts of the crisis, but it's also valuable on an ongoing value basis for physicians as well as the healthcare systems they operate in. We are helping to ensure that digital health is now the new standard of care for respiratory care. Let me now review our software as a service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter our SAAS business grew in the mid single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets. The verticals include home medical equipment, Brightree HME, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, senior living and life planned communities. Our HME customers are leveraging our advanced resupply solutions, including SNAP technology and Brightree resupply for our existing portfolio of patients. And they are contributing to ongoing growth as the flow of new patients in HME continues to recover steadily period by period. Over the past 12 months COVID-19 has had a dampening effect on elective and emergent procedures at hospitals as we all know, and that has slowed hospital discharge rates affecting patient flow and ultimately, the centers rates at skilled nursing facilities home health, hospice and beyond. As the rate of vaccinations accelerate across the U.S. and the number of COVID-19 cases continues to trend downward in this country, we're seeing improvements in the census rates across skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, and across all post acute care settings. In addition to the solid organic growth that we're seeing in our SaaS business, we closed an exciting acquisition just this month. The company is called Citus Health. Citus is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions for home infusion and specialty pharmacy, as well as the home health and hospice markets. Citus enhances the patient experience and it also improves provider efficiency and reduces the workload for frontline clinicians and caregivers. We are excited to have the Citus team as part of the ResMed family of solutions and to leverage their digital collaboration and patient support platform in our mission to improve patients lives outside the hospital. I'm very impressed by the breadth and depth of talent at Citus and their passion for patient care. This goes from their CEO, and co-founder, all the way to the front line. We're very excited to have them join our team and we will be better together. As we look across our portfolio solutions for Brightree to MatrixCare to now Citus, including HME, specialty pharmacy, home infusion, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, senior living, life plan communities and private duty home care. We expect this portfolio, this SAAS portfolio of revenue growth to accelerate, increasing for mid single digit growth that we saw in this quarter to high single digit growth as we move forward. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these sort of market average growth rates and we continue to take share across the verticals that we're in. We also see opportunity to drive growth through further acquisitions that will augment and add to our existing portfolio of solutions. Our offerings are very well received in each of these verticals and we continue to see and leverage analytics and the technology that we have across our core business and the SAAS business to help people age in place, and minimize or eliminate acute care episodes. Looking at the broader ResMed portfolio of business across sleep, and respiratory care as well as our software as a service solutions, we remain confident in our long term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our mission to improve lives, drives and motivates with millions across the world every day. COVID has highlighted and continues to highlight the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. It is highlighted also the importance of digital health and remote care. And it has also accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient, screening, diagnosis, setup, as well as remote patient management and monitoring. We've continued to invest aggressively in R&D and innovation to ensure our solutions are best-in-class and are a catalyst for future growth. With 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment, and engagement of people with our digital health pathways. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across the 140 countries that we operate in. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude for more than 7,500 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these most unusual circumstances these last 15 months. This team has helped save the lives literally of many hundreds of 1000s of people around the world with ventilators. With these emergency needs. The team has now rapidly pivoted back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma. And for all those who need world-class care delivered well away from the hospital, and preferably in their own home. Thank you. With that, I will now hand the call over to Brent in Sydney. And then we will move to Q&A. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today I will provide an overview of our results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and comment on our FY 2022 outlook. Unless noted, all comparison are to the prior year quarter. Great revenue for the last quarter was $769 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue decreased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Consistent with our prediction during the Q2 earnings call, we drew off negligible incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the March quarter, where their prior year to revenue included an incremental benefits from COVID-19 we've added sales of approximately $35 million. Excluding the impact, they actually carry FY 2021 revenue increased by 1% in constant currency terms. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, a 1000 us Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase in 2%. Prior to Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $272 million, a decrease of 5% or a decrease of 13% in constant glassy terms. By product segment, U.S. Canada and Latin America device sales were 193 million, a decrease of 2%. Mask and other sales with 210 million an increase of 7%. Europe, Asia and other markets, the cost sales totaled $173 million, a decrease of 11% or in constant currency terms, 18% decrease. Now, when I was out in Europe, Asia and other markets were 99 million an increase of 9% or flat year over year in constant currency terms. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales decreased by 10%, while masks and other sales increased by 4%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales in the prior year quarter, Global device sales declined by 3% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 6% in constant currency terms. Software as a service revenue for the third quarter was $94 million, an increase of 5% than the prior year quarter. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 40 basis points to 59.6% in the March quarter compared to 60% in the same quarter last year. The interest is predominantly attributable to higher freight costs, additional manufacturing costs associated with the transition to our new Singapore site we'll commenced operations during the quarter, and geographic mix changes. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $160 million, a decrease of 7% or in constant currency term SG&A expenses decreased by 11% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.9% compared to the 22.4% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q4 FY 2021 to increase in the low single digit relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $56 million, an increase of 9% or in constant currency basis, an increase of 3%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 6.7% in the prior year. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses in Q4 to increase year-over-year in the high single digits reflecting our long term commitment to innovation. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $18 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Our Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $242 million, an increase of 2%, reflecting well contained operating expenses. For the March quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserves of $255 million, which is net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement and third-party audits by the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO. The audits covered tax year 2009 to 2018 [ph], as previously disclosed for 2009 to 2013. The OTO issued assessment of $256 million inclusive of penalties and interest. The 2014 to 2018 year audits remain open, ongoing and assessments have not been issued. We have tentatively agreed on a number with the ATO to resolve the entire matter for all years. We expect any adjustments to reserve will be taking this quarter would be material. Next steps include getting to a written agreement and final Board approval. If the deal falls apart, we will wait to get. We continue to believe we are more likely than not to succeed in litigation. However, transfer pricing litigation is complex, costly and uncertain. So we are looking forward to putting this behind us. As a result of reporting reserve on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for March quarter was 136%. While our non GAAP basis, which excludes the reserve, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our underlying non-GAAP FY 2021 effective tax rate will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Our Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $190 million, an increase of 1%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of 1%. As a result of the tax reserve recorded this quarter, our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $78 million and our GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter was $0.54. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $196 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partly offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $26 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter total $40 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the last quarter associated with Verily joint venture. And going forward we expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $231 million. At March 31, we had $734 million in gross debt, and $503 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest and in March 31, we had a further $1.5 billion available for drawdown under existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. During the third quarter we completed the acquisition of Citus Health. Citus Health is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions that enable real time secure collaboration between patients and those involved in the care. We also acquired certain business assets of Tongil Medical company based in Korea, which primarily represented Tongil's sleep and respiratory distribution business. Both these acquisitions will not be material to our group results. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity providing flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions like Cypress Hill. We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividend program. We may also resume our share buyback program sometime during the calendar year. This program has been on board since our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal year 2019. Turning now there are expectations on the outlook for Q4, FY 2021 and FY 2022 outlook, The remains uncertainty in the short term particularly interdicting the timing and recovery of the patient flow from COVID-19 related impacts across the many countries we operate in. Consequently, we expect Q4 FY 2021 revenue to reflect low single digit sequential growth over Q3 FY 2021. As we move through FY 2022, we expect to see continued improving in new patient flow and return to more normal I underline revenue growth trends. Additionally, we are seeing minimal COVID-19 generating demand for our ventilators. And do not expect that any material benefit going forward. As a reminder, we recorded 35 million COVID-19 generating revenue in a March last quarter last year, $125 million at June quarter last year, and $40 million in our first quarter of FY 2021. Mask and accessories has continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past three months reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of every supply service offering. We expect to see continued year on year growth of their mask sell in FY 2022. Finally, like many, many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, particularly in relation to the timing of the reopening of economies if the vaccination programs rolled out. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I'll hand call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great, thanks, Brett. Saline, I'd like to now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call. Saline, are you there, ready to run the QA portion of the call. Operator : Excuse me, this is the backup operator. We have a question coming from the line of Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning all, and thank you for taking my question. Perhaps I could start with and rest to the world or outside of the United States in America in terms of the device trends you're seeing there. Certainly down 18% on constant currency. Could you help split in terms of what you're seeing in terms of real devices decline without the COVID impact there? And then also, particularly for Germany and France, what you're seeing in that market currently, and what sort of rate it's offering as a percentage of normal, particularly given the increased COVID cases in those countries? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And clearly as I said in the prepared remarks, the March 2020, $35 million worth of ventilators were primarily where COVID was impacting them, which was Southwest China, and so probably Hubei province and Northern Italy. So China and Italy. And so clearly, the $35 million worth of sales in the March quarter last year, were predominantly in that rest of world category. So, you can imagine that the actual decline in terms of the COVID impact on year-on-year is significantly below that 18% cc that you talked about, much further below that. And really importantly, when you look at the sort of kinetics of this, and you think about the December quarter to the March quarter, and then what we're going to see in June, we're seeing countries opening up. They're adopting digital health and they're finding ways to make it work. And even in France and Germany where you didn't see lockdowns in the retail side, the healthcare was not as impacted. And our digital health solutions, particularly around remote patient screening diagnosis have been effective. And so, we're seeing that open up as we move forward. Rob, do you want to take the second part of the question? Rob Douglas : Yes. The Germany and France? Mick Farrell : Yes. Rob Douglas : The challenge in Germany and France really in this quarter has been sort of the second waves, which really caused extensive lockdowns and put challenges in there. We had seen sort of incremental opening up, that actually slowed down. It wasn't quite as significant as before, where we really saw all of the sleep labs get converted into COVID wards. But we certainly saw a reduction in new patient flow in most countries as well, there's been a significant issue. In terms of actually breaking out the sort of the device sales in those specific countries without the COVID impact earlier, and I don't think we'll be able to give that sort of granularity to really clarify that for you. But underlying it, we need to understand that those sleep businesses continued, and also you're probably aware that ventilation businesses in Europe are a larger share than what they are with the ResMed business and what they are in terms of the global ResMed business. So there was a factor in that in terms of the relativity to what had happened with the incremental COVID ventilator sales in the previous period. Lyanne Harrison : Thank you very much. Rob Douglas : Thanks, Lyanne. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning. Just firstly on U.S. devices. What was the performance of underlying CPAP devices next COVID? I'm assuming, there was very limited COVID ventilator sales in the prior year. So I guess when we compare this last quarter, was actually much weaker. So is that because there's less patients coming through the sleep labs? Or were there potentially market share losses? Can you explain what happened from a sequential performance between last quarter and this quarter? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Gretel. Good question. And if you look at just U.S., Canada, Latin America, so the Americas numbers, devices were down 2% year-on-year. And if you think about what we're talking about the COVID recovery rates being somewhere between 70% of pre COVID patient flow to 90% of recovered patient flow depending on the country. If you just do that raw math there, that comes out to 98% of pre-COVID, basically, which is not quite there, because there are some replacement devices included there. But certainly, we actually saw very steady market share, some gains in some of the mask areas, but very steady market share in the device side. Some of our competitors are having some difficulties around supply, as well as our global supply chains and other factors going on. We may have even taken some share in the device side. So, what we're seeing just in those U.S. numbers, when you think about sequential from the December to March quarter is really all about, as I said in the prepared remarks around deductibles, resetting those deductibles and impact devices significantly more than masks and accessories. If you look at the masks and accessories, just in that quarter, we saw 7% constant currency growth in masks and accessories in the March quarter year-on-year. But always there's a sequential impact from December to March. And so that's the net. But no actually share very steady, maybe moving up a little on the mask side, very steady on the devices with some modest gains. But the year-on-year 2% decline in devices is truly around the COVID recovery rates. And as we know, the rollout in the U.S. has actually been pretty strong in terms of the vaccinations. I don't think we're quite at the 98%, which would mean, that 2% decline could indicate. But I do think that we are moving well towards the 90% range in some states, and the sort of 80% range and some other states of pre COVID patients flow. But every period we look at, we see improvement in both of those. Thanks for the question Gretel. Gretel Janu : Thanks very much. Operator : We have a next question coming in from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret Kaczor : Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned that -- I believe one point in the comments that you expect to return to that double digit underlined growth in the second half of fiscal 2022. And then you were kind enough to give us a series of free instances, while [Indiscernible] suggests will go on the offensive. But the question is, how quickly can those investments take hold? And as you look at the short term, will growth still remain on the bottom of that you shaped that you discussed previously until you get to that second half of the fiscal year? Or can there be meaningful, more meaningful improvements driven by some of these investments? Sorry, I know, it's a long question. But can the U.S. for example, even being further ahead on the vaccination curve actually help you guys and offset maybe some other geographies that are a little weaker? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks Margaret. That is a very good question and a thorough one. Look, clearly, we're very confident that the medium to long term of the core business is incredible, given the flow of patients and the flow of our new technology. There are short term dynamics around second and third waves, and then the vaccinations on the positive side and the opening up of the economies on the positive side. As we put it all together, we are very confident that as we get the AirSense 11 from control product launch, to then start to roll that out over this calendar year in the U.S. market, that will be a catalyst for growth. It brings not only the hardware, but also amazing software solutions for patients, physicians, providers, and others. And as we think about the scaling of just the remote patient, digital health models from some of our partners, and identification, engagement and enrollment, all the way through to home sleep, testing and home sleep set up and rolling out of those devices, we're seeing a lot of investments start to pay off on that. So look, it's really hard to get down to the dynamics of how quickly vaccines will go. How quickly economies will open up. But here in the U.S., which is our biggest market, we're certainly seeing both of those trend in a really positive manner. And that led me to talk about pretty bullish sort of double digit growth towards the back end of our fiscal year 2022. And so, I think they're all the dynamics going into it. I don't know Jim Hollings, if you've got any further thoughts as the President of our Sleep and Respiratory Care Business about how quickly we can use that technology to drive growth towards that back end. James Hollings : Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret, for the question. I really just would reiterate what Mick says. I think that when you think about growth, when we get back to double digit growth, the numbers were against the big comps that came out COVID, right? So when you think about growth as a percentage. And so, the underlying dynamic in the market and U.S. specific about the U.S. market, it\u2019s pretty strong. March was the best month of the quarter for us in new patient growth than the U.S. market. And so we think that that trend is going to continue. And we're very hopeful about vaccine rollouts. We'll start to open up diagnostics. And of course, we have the new product that will come out in the calendar year. So we feel very confident about the underlying cores, the business continuing to grow over the coming quarters. And then we'll be able to not just maintain share, but probably take some share. But there's obviously some uncertainty associated with COVID, and some other things where we feel very confident for underlying growth dynamic, and it's the COVID comp that has to clear for us to be able to talk about double digit growth. Margaret Kaczor : Okay. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Margaret. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Matthew Mishan with Keybanc. Your line is open. Matthew Mishan : Great. Hello, Mick, thanks for the questions. I listened to the HCA calls, which is a theater [ph] large hospital system in the U.S. They seem to be integrating in hospice and home health into their systems at this point. And you've seen like Cerner not really want to follow up the hospital customers down. How can you work with large hospital systems as they migrate down into your victim to scale? Mick Farrell : Matt, it\u2019s a great question, and it talks to within our software as a service business, obviously, we have privacy, we have cyber security, but then we have interoperability. And interoperability making sure our data can through secure Private API's be able to interact with hospital care systems, is an incredibly important part of the system. We call an out-of-hospital healthcare, because we don't believe you have to go to hospital to get good health care, but the hospital systems call it post acute care. And that link between post acute care and out-of-hospital care has to be very secure and has to be very seamless, if you like for the patient and for the healthcare system. We're now many quarters into our Cerner partnership and what we've shown in that to our partner there, Cerner is that ResMed is a great recipient of patient from the hospital system into both home health and hospice and beyond now into infusion with that partnership. And I think we've got a sort of a track record, that ResMed can take care of those patients and make sure that there's a seamless transition from hospital to the out-of-hospital healthcare network. And so, with that proven track record, I look to their customers, those sort of Cerner, Epic and Allscripts, their customers being HCA and others, as HCA sort of broadens their holistic care if you like, our patients from hospital to the home, that's an opportunity for those providers to partner with someone like ResMed. So there's the seamless transfer of the patients. Look, the ultimate goal is that we take costs out of the system. We take care of the patient better. And we have seamless transfer from hospital to home or out-of-hospital care. And then hopefully not but if you do go back to the hospital, that record can move back and forwards very well. We've got a good track record of it. And I actually see a lot of upside, as hospital systems think holistically in that sort of ACO sort of Accountable Care Organization approach. And we've got a lot of experience in Western Europe, in patients taking care of holistically throughout Northern Europe and beyond. So I'm confident that we will do well in this evolution of sort of an acute care system or sick care system to a true healthcare system and a preventative health care system, which is where ResMed best 90 plus percent of our revenues and profits, and really with the SAAS business, it's where we are the only strategic with the capability to scale not just across the U.S., but globally. Matthew Mishan : Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Matson : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the AirSense 11. Is there anything more you can tell us about that product and how it compares to AirSense 10. And then, historically, when you've launched new for generic platforms, it has had a fairly sizable impact on your growth, at least on the device side. So is there any reason to believe that that won't happen with this? And then, similar question on the cost. Is this going to be a higher, I guess a lower cost of manufacturing slash higher gross margin product? What just ramps up, obviously? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes, Thanks, Mike. Great question with three great parts to it. So the first part, the AirSense 11 is out there. It's in control product launch. As I said, in the prepared remarks, I'm personally part of that CPL. And just amazing benefits for the individual patient and the bed partner in terms of how quiet comfortable cloud connected and capabilities. So the features are extraordinary. One thing, we've opened up to the most we ever have around the pipeline that is out there, because there's a public regulatory documents out there, and it's in CPL. I don't want to go through all the features and functions other than to say that, but it's smaller, it's quieter, it's more comfortable, it's more cloud connected. And it's not just the device, it's the software system that goes with it that provides a value for not just the patient, but the physician, the provider, and the healthcare system that are part of it. So, to the second part in question around growth, yes, look, I do think this will be a catalyst for growth. That\u2019s why I'm comfortable in the prepbox [ph]. And you answered to Gretel earlier to talk about our comfort in saying, we're going to push towards double digit growth for the back end of this fiscal year that we're in here. And I think this device will be a catalyst for it. I think the software, the digital health technology software around it will be a large part of that catalyst for growth. Obviously, we're a different business than, when I was running the Sleaford, we launched the S9. It was, I think the total revenues of the company were less than a billion dollars. And now the total revenues are over $3 billion, trailing 12 months. And so, the percentage growth, the numbers won't be as impressive as 10 years ago, but the growth in terms of net revenue and profitability, we can reinvest in the business for more devices and less software will certainly be there. The third party question around cost. Clearly our goal, every generation is to create smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more clever devices and software systems, but also ones that have better efficiency. So we lower cost of manufacturing low cost to our supply chain. So clearly, that's an important part of this platform. We expect to do that, as he said, as we scale that up across our global business. Mike Matson : Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Mike. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open. David Low : Thanks very much. Mick, we are all aware that Philips had the issue with their devices. Just wondering what your expectations are? One, if we can clarify whether there's any risks that ResMed has the same issue with ozone cleaning? And then secondly, what the implications might be for ResMed position in the market? Mick Farrell : Yes, Thanks, David. And we clearly saw from the earnings call from our competitors, some issues that they're having with product quality. And I never comment on details of that. And I think all of us care most of all about our patients. And so, Rob, you want to talk a little bit to our quality standards and what we're working on as we look at that issue? Rob Douglas : Sure. Yes, David, as Mick said, patient Safety is our number one priority, and we really focus on that. And we've actually paid a lot of attention to the timing devices over the years. And I can confidently say, we actually don't have this problem that has been reported by competitors. We have a different design using different materials. And we have a very solid test, aggressive testing procedure looking at this. We have a very sophisticated complaint tracking system, and across our 40 million installed base, we -- this is just not there at all. So we're extremely confident with that. We do -- we will always continue to pay close attention to patient safety and keep on it. The issue of ozone cleaning is an issue there. And we have communicated regarding our warranty position on that. It's an effective disinfectant, but the amount of use is important to keep a close eye on. So we've publicly put out information on that. And you can find that on our website, if you're interested in that. So, but we'll keep a close, very close eye on this as we would with any industry safety issue. David Low : Okay. Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks. David, actually does the second part of your question talks about what would be the implications in the market? I mean, clearly, I don't know if Jim Hollings wants to talk to this. But look, we want to take share when our products are smaller, quieter, more comfortable and better. And we've been doing that for three decades. But clearly, they might be some share implications if a competitor has constraints around supply. Jim, do you want to talk a little bit to that? James Hollings : Sure. I think we're waiting to see what will happen with our competitors position and their ability to deliver product, but we're obviously always ready, willing and able to help our customers and more product. And to whatever extent there's potential upside for us and market share gains during the next quarter or two, and that we'll certainly do our best to take advantage of it. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sean Laaman : Thank you. And good morning, Mick. Good morning, everybody. Mick, even just in broad brushstrokes to answer this question. We've seen, I guess, one of the better term the finale of competitive bidding, and it shape many, in its proposed shaped many months ago. I'm wondering if that's had any influence or what influenced that might have had with respect to pricing since that point in time? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Sean. That's a great question. And I'll hand back to James Hollings to talk about whether the elimination of competitive bidding pretty much in terms of delight in 2024 has any implications for pricing with us without the U.S. customers. Jim, do you want to take that? James Hollings : Yes, sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Competitive bidding being cancelled led to ongoing stability in the pricing in the U.S. market, and that's what we see. There's instability in pricing throughout the period, because there's stability of reimbursement. And we -- but far, we haven't seen any signals from CMS that they intend to relaunch a program. So it's a weird way to answer the question, but the non event lesson a little changes, we've just seen price instability. Sean Laaman : Great. Thanks. Awesome. Appreciate the answer. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Sean. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Andrew Goodsall with MST Macquarie. Your line is open. Andrew Goodsall : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I'm just going to touch back on your SAAS business. I know a few questions on this particular MatrixCare. But just trying to think in practical terms, how quickly we can sort of see that come back to certainly a lot of commentary in the marketplace that there's a big swing on the back of COVID to home delivery care in the home. So yes, just trying to sort of think just over the next sort of quarter how you're seeing the profile, that recovery? Mick Farrell : Yes, Andrew, thanks. It's a great question. And there are so many dynamics of hospital care and in the flow out through post acute care to our SAAS system. I think, as we look forward, we saw 5% growth in the quarter across our SAAS business. We think the weighted average market growth across those seven or now eight verticals that we're in with Citus joining the portfolio, and specialty pharmacy and home infusion. We think that sort of mid single digit growth can move towards high single digit growth as we see patients get back to the hospital and therefore get back to the discharged to skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, and beyond. And so, it's difficult to say the exact rate of increase, but it's going to increase. And I think our technology and what we've invested in, particularly, even during COVID, some of the software that we put for our skilled nursing facility customers to manage patients who may or may not be infected by COVID, and how they operate their businesses have been very well received. So even as case rates declined, but COVID is still here, and it is still across, even with vaccinations going up, still going to impact those customers. I think some of those tools will help us see a faster path to getting from that mid single digit growth to high single digit growth across the group. And as I said in the prep remarks, and this is true for ResMed always. We don't just want to meet market growth, we want to beat that market growth. So, as I look towards our long term strategy and 2025, we've got the opportunity for to get way back to double digit growth in our SAAS business. But in the short to medium term, I think we can move from mid single digits to high single digits in this part of our portfolio. We've made the investments in the technology. We've made the investments for the customers to help them deal with the dynamics of code. And as recovery happens, we will be a partner for them for growth on the other side. Andrew Goodsall : That's great. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Hi, Mick. Brett, can you hear me, Alright? Mick Farrell : Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Perfect. Suraj Kalia : So, Mick, couple of questions. And I'll just kind of put them together. Mick, I'm not sure I heard about the EHR 2 report. Would love to get you a perspective from a counter messaging perspective and any quantification of impact? And the second part of my question, Mick, if I could, the SAAS business, there was a period of time that it was a tailwind to margins to top line growth. And just kind of looking at it over the last, let's say, four or so quarters, it seems to be becoming a drag for the overall growth, some of these COVID issues notwithstanding, maybe you can just kind of parse this through the structural dynamics of returning this line item to what you would have perceived as normalized growth? Thank you for taking my questions. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Suraj. I'll hand the first question to Dave on AHRQ. And then I'll take the second one on SAAS. David Pendarvis : Yes. Thanks, Suraj. And I'll give you this kind of a brief response here. If you want any more details, feel free to reach out to Amy, and she can bring you up to speed. But basically, AHRQ, we believe is taking a very narrow perspective on looking at the clinical literature, looking at only randomized controlled trials done under certain very careful criteria. And while traditionally, that has been the hallmark of the gold standard of trials, we think, particularly in this industry, where you've got a massive amount of real world evidence and a lot of other longitudinal trials that clearly demonstrate a benefits in terms of longevity, benefits in terms of clinically significant cardiovascular outcomes, also quality of life outcomes, and also outcomes in terms of healthcare utilization, lower costs, all of that evidence ought to be used to come to a conclusion that treating sleep apnea with CPAP therapy is not only good for patients, but good for the healthcare systems, and good for economies as a whole. So, we're hopeful that all that evidence that we've brought in, and it's not just us, other societies, many of the clinical societies have come out. And there's been a vigorous sort of a cross industry wide cross clinical, academic, keeping leaders have all come out in the same direction. So we're hopeful that will be taken into account. And the final report, which we don't know when it'll be even likely, perhaps later this calendar year, we'll include that data and come to a better conclusion. Mick Farrell : So Suraj, the only thing I'd add to Dave's response, which is very thorough, is that actually there are RCTs randomized control trials but also are excellent that weren't included. So if you're just looking at RCTs, even, you need to include some of those RCTs, which were in fact very positive. And the AHRQ just looked at some neutral RCTs and said, well, neutral that means no benefit. There's all these other proponents of evidence real world and RCTs that are positive. So, it was an interesting some section of the literature that they used. And we have lots of folks ask at academics working on that. On a second party question, SAAS, if you look at, it actually was a strong tailwind for us in this quarter, 5% growth versus the COVID included core part of the business. And I think it can be. As we look forward, and I spoke to this earlier in my answer to Andrew, about SAAS, going from mid single digits to high single digits, I think it can -- and then after meeting or beating that, so getting to double digit growth, in the SAAS part of our business, I do think that will become a tailwind for us that 12% of our revenue. So for the SAAS, as we get out of, the COVID, sort of slowdown of census rates in this out-of-hospital care, we get back to a normal flow of patients through. Because people are wanting to age in place, people are wanting to be outside the hospital. COVID just increase. The probability that people do not want to be in a hospital for any longer than they need to. And so I think the geographic and socio economic trends of a growing community and people wanting to age in place in an aging population, and the fact that people are seeing lower cost, lower acuity and better healthcare delivered outside the hospital all lead towards this. The dynamics of how quickly we go from mid single digit growth to high single digit growth, we can divide. But the fact is, it's going to go there, because people are moving from the hospital to out-of-hospital healthcare. And that's where we're investing. So, as I look forward to our long term strategy 2025, I am very confident that this will be a very strong tailwind to our business. The recovery of our whole business post COVID is what we're talking about here. But I look on the end of the FY 2022, strong double digit growth across our business. And I mean that across our whole business. Thanks for the questions, Suraj. Operator : We have our last question coming from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. Maybe just to follow up on the SAAS business and kind of going between Brightree and, and Matrix here. On the Brightree side, there was some consolidation in HME space through 2020. And just wonder if that is cycling through the numbers there. And in sort of how that plays out. But when sort of when we think of course, lead trends, if you could provide maybe a quick update on sleep labs in particular, I know, it's a small portion of the overall business. But it sounds like there could be a reversal in activity as folks actually get back to sleep labs. So just sort of an update on sleep labs? Thanks a lot. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the questions. Anthony. To your first part of question around SAAS. Yes, I mean, clearly there's consolidation of some plays in the HME industry, and that can impact our contracts with those. In general SAAS is per user per month, like per activating user per month approach. And so, acquisitions are -- HME acquiring another HME that doesn't currently use Brightree. Is actually upside for us, because usually, the acquiring entity has all the efficiencies and scale and capabilities, because they using Brightree, and then they put that into the acquired account. And so therefore, actually increased the number of users and the per user per month revenue for ResMed can be upside on that. If it's a Brightree user acquiring another Brightree user, well, then there can be some reduction, they might get some efficiencies and reductions of the number of chairs. But ultimately, if it's a smart customer it\u2019s going to continue to grow. And so then that over time, as they grow will increase our revenues as part of that. So a lot of dynamics around the M&A there. But in general, in the long run for us, it's about us betting on the winning and efficient ATMs and Brightree helps us do that. Because the people who adopt Brightree other winners, they have the lowest costs and the best outcomes for their patients. So the second part of your question around sleep labs, I look over capacity here in the U.S., and the reduction that happens during COVID or in lab tests, those people scale their digital health solutions in their home sleep testing capability. So as they come back and open up the in-lab facilities, I think that will absolutely have a rebound of the capacity in the in-labs, but they won't lose what they gained in home sleep testing. As Aristotle said, when the mind is stretched by a new idea, it never returns to its original size. So they're not going to forget about these great digital health solutions that have the home sleep testing. So yes, we'll get the capacity back in the sleep lab. But I also think the scalable opportunity for those sleep diagnostics providers to provide low cost, customer friendly diagnostics and the home will be just a part of their portfolio and hopefully, will improve the rate of diagnosing the 936 million people worldwide. But we're just looking at the U.S., the 70 million people in this country that have mild, severe obstructive sleep apnea that need to be taken care of. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And I'll hand back to you, Amy to close up the call. Amy Wakeham : Thanks, Mick. Did you want to give your closing remarks? Mick Farrell : Sure. Yes. But I know we're nine minutes over. So I'll make this brief. Thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd like to thanks once again, the 7,500 ResMedians, many of you, shareholders, thank you for your hard work, dedication, helping people sleep better, breathe better, around 140 countries worldwide. Thank you for the many 1000s of enlightens. You're getting right now to our team in India. So that we can take care of people in this another emergency. I look forward to talking to you and to all of our shareholders here again in 90 days. Thanks. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick. And thank you all again for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our call. Salini, you may now close out the call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Rob, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. As Rob said, this call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with a copy of the earnings release and presentation. On the call today are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will join us during the Q&A session. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review ResMed's SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. Before I turn the call over to Mick, I would like to highlight ResMed's upcoming Virtual Investor Day on September 8, which we announced in our earnings press release today. More details and information including an agenda and how to register will be available on our Investor Relations website approximately 2 weeks before the event. Okay, Mick, over to you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review result of our June quarter, the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2021. On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our financial results as well as review progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals. I will discuss execution highlights against our top three strategic priorities and our urgent and ongoing actions to address current industry supply chain issues and opportunities. I'll then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. Let me start with the situation that has generated many stakeholder questions in the last month and half. During the quarter, demand for ResMed's Sleep and Respiratory Care devices surged dramatically after our competitors recall announcement, putting additional pressure on an already challenging environment for our industry's supply chain. Global supply chain limitations including a shortage of electronic components, as well as ongoing freight constraints and costs are impacting our ability to respond to the unprecedented increase in demand for ResMed products. Executive teams across automotive, consumer product and communications technology industries have confirmed on their recent earnings calls that they are struggling with the same issues. Some major producers have suggested the chip and electronic components shortages could extend 12 or even 18 months. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners to ensure access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. During this June quarter, the demand spike was so high that we have been forced to allocate products due to the unprecedented demand and these real world supply chain capacity constraints. In doing so, our guiding principles are very simple. We are focused on the highest acuity patient needs first. It's very similar to our approach to ventilator allocation during the peaks of the COVID crisis these last 18 months. We will continue to coordinate with all of our stakeholders as the situation develops, and we begin to open up the supply constraints. We understand this is a frustrating situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, and most importantly the ultimate customer, the patient. It is a unique time in our industry, with steady recovery of patient flow after COVID-19 peaks in various countries. With these global supply chain constraints and with an unforeseen competitor recall, all occurring simultaneously. I want to be clear that through it all our priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need and when they need it. Let me be very clear about a couple of things. One, ResMed sleep apnea and respiratory care devices are safe to use. They are the best in the market. They are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable and the most connected therapies. And Positive Airway Pressure therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of sleep apnea. And two, ResMed will not be able to fill the entire supply gap that has been created by this situation caused by a competitor just 7 weeks ago. They were the number two player to our number one leading market position in almost all of the 140 countries that we compete in worldwide. We're doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the past, the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale. We expect to be in a somewhat supply chain constrained environment throughout fiscal year 2022. This news from our competitor was only released to the market on June 14. So we are in the first 7.5 weeks of our response. However, we have already partnered with our global supply chain team both internal and external. And although we expect the current quarter and the December 2021 quarter will be the most supply constrained. We do see room for expansion of supply ahead. We expect that the flow of ResMed products will accelerate significantly during the March 2022 and the June 2022 quarters. We are focused on partnering with physicians, providers and distributors to ensure that our devices get to newly diagnosed patients. And while that human impact is the most important, I know our investors and our analysts need to model the future financial impact of this accelerated growth on our ResMed financials. Based upon our latest supply chain information and analysis, we see a path to $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022 over and above our previously planned revenue growth for fiscal 2022. Importantly, we see a clear opportunity to increase our long-term sustainable market share, as patients, physicians and providers experience our ResMed market leading device and integrated cloud-based software solutions. Our experience over the last 7 plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%. They can drive their own patient adherence rates up to over 87% and beyond. After doing that, they don't want to go back to an inferior solution. And yes, during the near distant future, we will be starting the full product launch of our brand new next-generation platform called AirSense 11. Let me now turn to overall market conditions in our industry. As we discussed last quarter, the countries we operate in are at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of sleep apnea and COPD patient flow. We are seeing continued improvement in patient flow country-by-country. But there is a wide variance in that total patient flow from 75% of pre-COVID levels in some countries around the world to 95% or even 100% of pre-COVID levels in other countries. Vaccines are steadily rolling out country by country. And at the same time new variants including the Delta variant continue to cause disruption in some geographies. Our team remains committed to working with hospitals and health care providers to provide the ventilators, masks and training that they need for acute care. We will continue to support frontline respiratory therapists and physicians as well as providers, patients and our ResMedian team throughout the 140 plus countries that we operate in. A few things that have become really clear during this pandemic is that every country in the world has : one, increased its adoption of digital health solutions; two, increased its focus on respiratory hygiene and respiratory health; and three, increased its investments in health care treatment outside the hospital, and particularly in the home. These are all catalysts for ResMed's long-term growth. We are pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in diagnosing new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients. During the fourth quarter, our sales team delivered very strong revenue growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business. This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter, and with some tailwinds from our competitors recall right at the end of the quarter. While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue, and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit and all the while fighting for recovery patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts. Quite a performance from our team of 8,000 ResMedians helping people in 140 countries. We expect to see steady improvement in patient flow for sleep apnea and respiratory care therapy as we move throughout our fiscal year 2022. We are encouraged to see patients, physicians and providers adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, for home-based testing, for patient monitoring and for ongoing population health management. As the leader in digital health for the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as other chronic respiratory conditions, we are well-positioned to drive this growth with our health care delivery partners. During the quarter, we generated over $227 million of operating cash flow, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders these last 90 days. Today, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend for shareholders to $0.42 per share. We are pleased to return your cash to you, our shareholders, reflecting our confidence in ResMed's resilient business and our ongoing cash flow. We also increased our R&D investments in digital health technology during the quarter, as well as our research and development for masks, for devices, for embedded device software and for global clinical research. All the while maintaining fiscal discipline with SG&A and keeping other operating costs in line. We are reinvesting for long-term growth. We lead the field of remote patient engagement and population health management with over 15 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. Our increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure that we provide superior value to patients, to physicians and to providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted, we have to earn it every day with every product, every solution, and every service and every customer interaction. Customers vote with their wallets. And right now they are voting for us, and we plan to keep earning their support. Our digital health technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value. With an industry leading intellectual property portfolio, including over 8,200 patents and designs. We now have over 9 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. We have over 16.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution for physicians. And we recently upgraded our patient engagement tool called myAir. This app is now cloud native and serverless in the cloud. This new myAir 2.0 release supports our next-generation platform called AirSense 11. The AirSense 11 platform comes to the market with new capabilities with improved data delivery, with scalable architecture, and with support for full cycle teams. And what that all means is that we have the opportunity for accelerated innovation in our ecosystem. We have over 110 million patients managed within our Software-as-a-Service network for out of hospital care. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customer groups, for patients, for physicians, for providers, as well as for private and government payers and the community -- communities that they serve. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. These are : one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. Last quarter, we previewed our next gen platform called AirSense 11. Responding to the current industry situation, our market leading research and development team accelerated the launch of the AirSense 11. First, by expanding the control product launch to additional customers just this last month. And second by moving to an earlier full product launch date. We now expect to launch in the United States before the end of this current quarter, and then to other countries gradually over time. This AirSense 11 device launch will be a device launch like no other in the history of ResMed. Previously we carefully timed new product platform launches to minimize the selling overlap of device platforms. We are in a unique situation today. Our market leading AirSense 10 continues to be very strongly adopted, and we believe that it is better than any other device currently on the market. In short, it makes sense to continue to sell the AirSense 10 at Skype, particularly as this will help maximize the overall CPAP, IPAP and bilevel volume available for our customers for sale given the unprecedented demand for new patients to receive ResMed devices in the market right now. The bottom line is that we're going to be selling both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 in parallel for quite some time, as we meet this extraordinary market demand over the coming fiscal year. And as we continue to expand the availability of AirSense 11 to new markets and new geographies around the ResMed world. We are very excited to bring the AirSense 11 to market, and I am understating the results when I say that the response to our control product launch has been very positive. AirSense 11 benefits patients and bed partners and the device and software platform combination will also benefit physicians, providers, payers and overall health care systems. As I said earlier, we make the smallest, the quietest and the smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. But they are also the most connected and the most clever devices. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology to increase patient engagement and inherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within our customers own health care systems, engaging patients directly in their own digital therapy like never before in the industry. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach these many hundreds of millions of potential patients with our Respiratory Care Solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drug delivery solutions, and high flow therapy offerings. We announced that our respiratory care business benefited this time last year in the June 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilation devices and mass solutions to meet the growing demand for COVID, on an acute scale to the tune of $125 million in sales. During the current June 2021 quarter, we had modest COVID-related ventilator sales. They were not material to our overall results, they were under $20 million in sales, just under. As the Delta variant of this coronavirus surges in various markets and regions, we will still be there to support governments and health care systems and the patients they serve in their acute need. But we do not expect the resulting revenue from COVID to be material to our global business. Of course, the broader humanitarian impact is measurable with preservation of life through our ventilation solutions, a top priority in all of these countries. Our supply chain focus is for Astral, our life support ventilator, then Stellar, our non-invasive ventilator, and then our Lumis and AirCurve platforms to ensure that we can help patients who need our support the most. Demand for our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD are experiencing the same steady recovery and new patient flow as we see in our sleep apnea business. We are balancing the growth in demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the last 18 months as customers balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe this time a year-ago. We are now expanding this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been helpful to physicians not only during the COVID crisis, but it is also increasingly valuable as an ongoing clinical tool for them and for the health care systems that they operate in. In summary, we are helping to ensure that digital health is the new standard of care for respiratory care. Let me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for out of hospital health care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in mid single digits year-over-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, and life plan communities. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our HME and home health products. And we continue to grow with customers as they utilize and optimize our resupply solutions to improve patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates improve across SNFs, and other care settings. We are watching this very closely as COVID peaks in the case of varying rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for our software purchasing that provides opportunities for us to increase our pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease state-by-state. Our leading position as the software provider of choice to the HME market enabled us to help customers manage through the pandemic and to maintain a healthy business. Our Brightree branded software solutions are allowing HMEs to work through current challenges within our industry, including the need for increased patient support, the need for management of product shortages in some categories, as well as ongoing growth in the resupply of much needed home medical equipment. As we look across our portfolio of solutions, we expect our SaaS revenue growth to gradually accelerate increasing from its current mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share from competitors. Additionally, we see opportunities on our radar screen to drive growth through further SaaS acquisitions to augment our existing organic growth. We have a good history of thorough due diligence, ensuring that ResMed is the best owner of the asset. And of course, that we can bring additional value for our customers with the new offering, and of course additional value for all of our shareholders. In summary, our SaaS offerings are well received in each of the verticals that we serve. And we see an increasing opportunity to leverage analytics to minimize acute care episodes for residents, patients and clients in our provider network. And ultimately, to allow people to age in place, away from a hospital and preferably in their own homes. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's businesses across both sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative products and solutions. Our mission and specific goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. The light shining on the importance of respiratory health and hygiene is brighter than it ever was due to this pandemic. COVID has also highlighted the importance of digital health, it's accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, diagnosis set up as well as patient monitoring and management. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D to ensure ResMed solutions remain market leading and provide a catalyst for long-term growth. With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment, and engagement of people within our digital health ecosystem. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across all of the 140 countries that we operate in. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during the most unusual, almost perfect storm of circumstances. You have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation these last 18 months as we suffered through COVID. And now you have rapidly pivoted the company back to provide ongoing support for our customers and patients during very challenging industry dynamics and supply chain constraints with unprecedented demand. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we will go to Q&A with the whole team. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $876 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep devices and masks, which was in turn driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels in the prior year quarter, and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. The increased year-over-year demand for our sleep solutions during Q4 was partially offset by a significant decline in COVID-19 related demand for our ventilators and related accessories. In the June quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand primarily in India was approximately $20 million, a decline of $105 million compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related revenue in both the June '21 and June '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 29% on a constant currency basis. Going forward, we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19 related demand. Note, as a reminder, in Q1 FY '21, we had COVID-19 related incremental revenue of approximately $40 million. As I mentioned before, during the June quarter, one of our competitors announced a product recall on certain sleep and respiratory devices, which in turn has resulted in significantly increased demand for our devices. We estimate that we generate an incremental device revenue of approximately $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter due to our competitors recall. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $472 million, an increase of 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $308 million, an increase of 11%, or an increase of 2% in constant currency terms. By product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $268 million, an increase of 30%. Masks and other sales were $204 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales totaled $210 million, an increase of 2% or in constant currency terms, a decrease of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $98 million, an increase of 36% or in constant currency terms a 24% increase. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 12%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 46% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 16% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Looking forward to fiscal year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform and share gains during our competitors recall. However, while we are working hard to increase capacity, we will not be able to meet all the expected demand resulting from our products -- compared from our competitors recall, primarily because of supply constraints for electronic components. And we expect these constraints to be more limiting in the first half of FY '22 than the second half. As Mick mentioned, we believe component supply constraints as they stand will currently limit incremental device revenue attributable to our competitors recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million during fiscal year '22. During my remaining commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 260 basis points to 57.3% in the June quarter, compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to a negative product mix impact, specifically a proportional increase in sales of our lower margin sleep devices, ISP [ph] declines and unfavorable foreign currency movements. We also continue to experience elevated and significant freight costs. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $181 million, an increase of 10% or in constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 4% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to the 21.5% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '22. R&D expenses for the quarter was $60 million, an increase of 14%. While on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8%, which is consistent with the prior year. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and digital solutions will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to be in the vicinity of 7% during fiscal year '22. Total amortization of required intangibles was $19 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $260 million, an increase of 7% underpinned by strong revenue growth. As I reported last quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $255 million during the previous quarter, which was net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement of transfer pricing audits by the Australian Taxation Office or ATO. During the quarter, we progressed our settlement discussions with the ATO and have refined our tax reserve estimate. As a result, we have determined the required reserve is $249 million or $6 million lower than the previous quarter estimate. And accordingly, we have recorded this as reduction in our GAAP tax expense in the June quarter. Next steps involve concluding a written agreement with the ATO and obtaining final approvals from each side, which we hope to achieve this quarter. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.4%. While on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rates for FY '21 was 18.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $198 million, an increase of 3%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.35, an increase of 2%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $195 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $227 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $28 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.3 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Verily joint venture, now called Primasun. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million for the quarter for fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $295 million. At June 30, we had $655 million in gross debt, and $360 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. And at June 30, we had a further $1.6 billion available for drawdown under existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. This represents an increase of 8% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Citus Health. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Brett. Rob, let's go ahead and start the Q&A portion of the call. I will turn it over to you to provide instructions and get going. Operator : Thank you, Amy. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Deakin-Bell with Citigroup. Pleased proceed with your question. John Deakin-Bell: Thanks very much. My question was just around the likely mix going forward. You've talked about that $300 million to $350 million impact from the recall, but we noticed quite a big difference in the growth rates in the U.S versus rest of the world in the quarter for devices. Can you just give us a feel for, firstly, why there was such a difference in the U.S versus the rest of the world for the quarter? And then going forward, how you think that mix might look in FY '22? Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, John. And, yes, look, it's really exciting to be able to provide $300 million to $350 million in incremental revenue for our shareholders, but devices for much needed patients out there over the coming fiscal year. And we actually we hope to get better than that as we look for more parts and pieces and components. That's our current forecast. Look, just breaking down the device numbers for the quarter, really strong device numbers for the U.S., at plus 30%. That was off the comp. If you remember this time a year-ago where sleep devices were way down and ventilators were picking up in the U.S., I think it was around plus 1% the comp, and so huge turnaround there plus 30% in this last quarter. And then in EMEA, Asia and rest of world this time last year, we had plus 35% growth because we had really strong ventilator sales, particularly to some Asia Pacific regions in their COVID crisis. And so that combo plus 35% was being analyzed, and we saw a minus 6% for EMEA, Asia and rest of world. So it's a combination, John of multiple factors of COVID for both those sort of regions, U.S., Canada, Latin America, plus 30% versus EMEA, Asia and rest of world lapping a plus 30% at their minus 6%. So as we project for the $300 million to $350 million, I think that's probably the most guidance we've ever given around an opportunity like this. I'm not going to split that by region, or by type or by area. But I can tell you, its supply chain constrained, not demand constrained. And everyone in all the 140 countries wants ResMed products. And everyone we make we sell and we are doing everything we can to drive more and more elements in our supply chain, wherever that bottleneck is in supply, whatever that part or pieces. I personally as the CEO, I'm calling up that supplier and talking to their CEO and saying, look, this component can go into a cell phone or a car, or it can go into a medical device that literally gives someone the gift of breathe. Please prioritize our part of the supply chain, and it's been working those last 7 weeks. We've been able to match $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue. And our goal is to continue every week, every month to do better and better on that. John Deakin-Bell: Thanks, Mick. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Hurren of MST. Please proceed with your question. Dan Hurren : Good morning, everyone. Mick, thanks very much for that additional information, the $300 million to $350 million. We're just trying to understand how that plays out over the year. And I guess we're trying to understand what the exit run rate would be on that plan as an uplift of your normal operations. So I guess, looking at how linear that will be and what sort of shape you'll be as you exited the full year? Mick Farrell : Yes, Dan, it's a good question. And I don't want to get into a sort of breakdown every 90 days approach on it. But what I can say in terms of color, Dan, for your modeling is that, we found out about this 7.5 weeks ago, and we've been working like crazy these last 2 months on the supply chain. And it's easy to open up supply 3 months out, 6 months out, 9 months out. So a lot of the additional flow of parts and pieces is back end loaded in the fiscal year. And so, much less supply chain constrained in the March quarter, and the June quarter of this fiscal year '22 we're in. And it's going to be tough out here. We're already in the September quarter, and we're hand to mouth. But look, we're not stockpiling. We're not putting stuff in inventory. We are pushing stuff through plants. Our plants aren't at full capacity, so we have capacity. It's really around components and parts and pieces that are the bottlenecks. And so, if you think about that color, it sort of gives you guidance to know that Q3 and Q4 will be a lot less constrained than Q1 and Q2. Q2 should be slightly better than Q1 and Q3 should be significantly better than Q2, and Q4 should be significantly better than Q2 and Q1 as well. Dan Hurren : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. David Bailey : Yes, good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. [Indiscernible] I mean, that's great additional detail on $300 million and $350 million. Is that devices [indiscernible] or is that the entire opportunity, as you said currently capturing consumables as well as ventilator -- any incremental ventilator sales coming through? Mick Farrell : Yes, David, that's a good clarification. So the $300 million to $350 million is incremental devices, including Astral, Stellar, AirCurve, Lumis as well as AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. So it's all physical product devices. It does not include any potential upside in masks that you can get while selling great flow generated capabilities. And so it doesn't include incremental sales of those. It's focused on the device side, but both ventilation and sleep apnea devices are included in that number. David Bailey : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, if I can. Just on the -- on a new patient coming in to the system, into observations over the last 12 months, I mean what sort of proportion should we think about of new patients that have a ResMed device also have ResMed [indiscernible] ResMed consumables. Is there a sort of a rough number, you're able to provide to try and understand what that could look like? Mick Farrell : Yes, I see where you're going with the question. It's sort of trying to get to the understanding of how much incremental mask share we might get when they're on a ResMed device. Look, as you know, it's an open system. And there's no requirement that a ResMed device has a ResMed mask. They are designed by the same engineers and the same building out there in Sydney, in the manufacturing -- advanced manufacturing site across the road. So they design to work together very well and they are better together. So there is a better uptake of ResMed masks with ResMed devices. And certainly, it's going through a channel where there's a sales person who's providing both of them. And so there's some opportunities on both the sort of clinical and technical side as well as the commercial and execution side for some incremental growth. I won't quantify that for you. But I do think there is some upside. David Bailey : That's great. Thank you, Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question Sean Laaman : Thank you, and good morning, Mick and team. Mick, my question relates to the commonality between components of the various devices. Is that -- is there a lot of commonality between the S 10 and S 11 platform. So therefore, the challenges of the same with respect to sourcing and does the 3x increase to capacity from your competitor compound [indiscernible] the picture for you? Thanks, Mick. Mick Farrell : Yes, Sean, two very good questions and very much related. Yes, I think there is some overlap of some of the parts and pieces between the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platform. It's 7 years newer in the market. And so there's a lot of upgraded electronic, mechanical, plastic and digital health technology in the device. And so there's a lot of new components as well. And there is demand from our competitor out there trying to cover their recall amount as well as catch up with the patients that need urgent replacements. We're not seeing as much of the latter, though. We have a supply chain that have some overlaps with some of our competitors, but actually very individually designed. And as we work through the supply chains, the whole medical device industry is a very small percentage point of the suppliers total capacity, which is great for us in that. We're not fighting for limited share versus a competitor, we're really fighting for share versus a large consumer phone company or automobile company and the suppliers, like medical devices, because firstly, we're relatively recession resistant. We don't suddenly stop our sales during the recession, as some people do in consumer purchases and automotive, and we're usually high margin for them. So -- and more sustainable growth in terms of what we're doing for our platforms. The AirSense 10 has been in the market for 7 years. And so these are long-term sustainable for them. So our arguments are very good with the supply chain. And that's why in the last 7 weeks, we've been able to identify that extra $300 million to $350 million in opportunity. But there is some commonality between our devices. And we will make those trade-offs and that's why we will provide both AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. But the AirSense 11 is a huge leap forward to the industry and our goal will be country-by-country to roll that out. But, yes, for the next 6, 12 months, there's going to be a lot of selling both the fantastic AirSense 10 and the amazing AirSense 11 in parallel in countries around the world. Sean Laaman : Great color, Mick. Appreciate it. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Sean. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Maggie Nolan : Hey, this is Maggie on from Margaret today. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the assumption of the $300 million to $350 million. So, in that assumption, are you assuming that new patients or is that going to be swapping your competitors existing patients. And then is there a potential here for more than your current revenue assumptions, if that incremental supply can be located a bit earlier than your current expectations. And then taking a one step further and looking out to fiscal year 2023, how are you guys looking at the tail of the benefit post recall? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Okay. Great, Maggie. This -- I think four great questions in your question there. I'll address the first half of that, and then I'll hand over to maybe Jim Hollings to address some of the latter questions about long-term. Firstly, yes, we are focused on new patients as they come through. We\u2019re the number one provider in almost all of the 140 countries that we're in, but the competitive with this recall was often the number two to our number one position. And so there's a lot of demand for new patient flow, and that's where we're focused, that\u2019s where we're laser focused. Frankly, it's their job to focus on replacement or recall, that was their job and their duty to go take care of those patients, and we're focused on the new patients, both together will create unprecedented demand in the market. So that's point one. We are focused on new patients. At a high-level, as we look out beyond sort of this competitive recall to say, what's the steady state as we get to fiscal '23 and towards the end of fiscal '22, I do think, as I said in the prepared remarks that we will achieve a permanent market share increase from this. ResMed has always been the quality leader, always been the clinical leader, always been the smallest class and most comfortable. But there were some customers who just been used to, the old devices from an American brand that was bought by the Dutch company for a long time, they just stuck with what they had. I think that will get a chance to experience. The [indiscernible] improvement, the efficiency improvement, the doctors being excited about having full digital on AirView and patients being excited about the interaction on MyAir and [indiscernible] that they get patients happy, physicians happy and provider happy because a happy patient is one who is buying masks because they need them on a replenishment basis. So I won't quantify it for you. But I do think there's a magnificent opportunity for us to get our technology in front of a whole new range of customers. On the other hand, where supplies are constrained right now, so we're focused on our existing customers and taking care of them and making sure that we can get the new patients set up for them. But Jim, any other color, you think on sort of changes to the market conditions and longer term implications? James Hollings : Yes, thanks, Mick and thanks, Maggie, for your question. I would say on long-term, as we were preparing to launch AirSense 11, our plan was to take market share, to take device share with the offering because the AirSense 11 offering both the device and the software we think is by far the best offering on the market. We're introducing at launch a number of innovations and the platform because of its connectivity allows us to introduce even more software innovations post-launch on an ongoing basis. And so as Mick said in his opening comments, we feel very confident that with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11, we have the two best sleep therapy devices on the market. So that was our plan all along. And I think that our competitors recall simply creates a window of opportunity for us, as Mick [indiscernible] to familiarize more customers, more patients with the innovations and to streamline workflows for providers and to provide, continually improving the patient experience on therapy, which drives up adherence, improves outcomes for patients and all of our stakeholders then winners with that. So we felt very confident as we were launching and I think the circumstances give us even more of an opportunity. Maggie Nolan : Great. Thanks so much. Mick Farrell : Maggie. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Andrew Paine with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Paine : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just looking at the supply chain issues, in particular, semiconductors, what can you do to actually increasing supply there. I noted last year you got 38 million semiconductors from Infineon to the COVID response. Are you able to get more access to semiconductors due to your position within the medical -- the health care system? Mick Farrell : Andrew, great question. I'll address maybe the first half and hand to Rob Douglas to talk a little bit to that. But look, I can tell you, as CEO, traditionally I'm taken into discussions with major customers, talking to the large multinational customers around the world and governments that we provide these great therapies and solutions for so that I can engage with them and talk about our great value. But at the moment I'm not doing that, because customer demand is almost infinite. And I'm being taken by my global supply team to talk to suppliers. And Andrew without naming individuals, I know that individual supply was named during the COVID crisis at their request, we are going and I'm spending time not just 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 steps up our supply chain and talking to people who make these basic plastics, electronics and components and parts and pieces and telling them. Sometimes they're unaware that further down the supply chain there's a life support ventilator or a non-invasive ventilator or a sleep apnea device that cures and treats sleep suffocation. And so just getting me that opportunity, firstly, it's very interesting for me. It's a new dynamic, and we're getting really good response from these suppliers. They also are under difficult supply chain conditions and often asked me to go with them further up the supply chain to talk to someone else. And it's a game of sort of bottleneck -- debottlenecking, if you like, in the global supply chain. We have a very advanced engineering team that are looking all day every day in our global supply alliance internally, led by Linda Laidlaw and her team and Andrew Price and his team. And they are pulling me in and doing much more themselves all day, every day to drive that. So it's an ongoing opportunity for us. It's a supply chain opportunity, but unique through the COVID impacts on freight costs and impacts on freight availability, but also the growth that we see ahead due to this unique situation. Rob any more color to talk about there on about supply chain for -- to Andrew's question? Rob Douglas : Yes, a few other factors, Mick. One is, after following up with COVID last year, when we rapidly ramp ventilation, usually for that ramp, you've got to put in longer term commitments. So we did have actually a lot of commitments on the ventilator devices going forward. And that will be helpful for us. As Mick said, we can always make a better case than a cyclical consumer product. And in fact, one of the key factors around that not only residing lives, but also for these supplies, we can give them very long-term forecasts that we usually hit and do really well. So we're able to give long-term forecasts and we know they like that and they can plan that in. The forecast is stable. It's unusual to have the sort of sudden increments that we've had as a result of recent industry events. And so we're putting that in and pulling stuff forward. But also given out, just the number of patients we've got to treat and where we are in the market, we're able to make some really solid long-term commitments with the suppliers as well. And so that really, really helps. And we will see, our commitment horizon actually had go quite a lot longer than what traditionally it's been. And then the other fact that Mick mentioned briefly also is we've got a really strong design team. And where there are sort of acute bottlenecks on particular components, we can forward design around those, but those design changes do take time. And they've got to be properly validated and tested and very rigorous testing on these products. So we can't just rapidly switch to a new component. But we can plan some months out that we'll be able to add in additional sources of components. So as you can imagine, this is sort of full core press for our supply chain and engineering teams and they're going flat out on this. Andrew Paine : That's great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Chris Cooper : Thanks, Mick and Brett. Can I just ask about the cost side of the equation. I mean, presumably, given the competition for chips here that you've been referring to through the call, I mean, it would be reasonable to assume that the cost side of the $300 million to $350 million is just going to be elevated versus what we normally see if you're business. And if that is the case, are you going to need to try and offset some of that pressure with price? Mick Farrell : Chris, that's a good question. I'll hand to Brett to talk a little bit around the costs and how we're taking care of those. And Rob, if he wants to chime in as well. Look, this is an unprecedented time. Before our competitor made this announcement, 7 weeks ago, there was already constraints in the market around some of the components. And certainly because of nobody travelling really internationally, consumer travel was down so much and all the freight in the back of those consumer jets was gone. The costs were higher. And look, we talked about this 90 days ago on our last earnings call, and you saw it in the COGS numbers for this June quarter. And that's going to be with us for a while. I mean, these, these costs aren't going away. It is more costly to get freight than it was because there's much less planes available. And it is -- with scarce components, although we have very long-term contracts, prices are being impacted by that. At the same time, we're in an environment where we have customers with contracts with payers, and the consumer side of our business, there might be some opportunity to work with the supply chain to think about how to get some of those costs through the channel. But certainly in the reimburse side of the market, it's about and you've got to think really long-term about on the other side of this crisis, how we and our customers going to engage in our long-term interactions. And so it's a complex equation. And -- but, Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to what we're doing to negotiate to achieve the best prices that we can get and to manage our gross margin there and the COGS there. And, maybe Jim talked to how we're working with customers on long-term pricing. So Brett, and then Jim. Brett Sandercock : Yes, Thanks, Mike. I mean, we do -- Chris, we do. I mean, obviously, and Rob mentioned that kind of, we have some of these longer term commitments that are contractually so that helps us there. But if you look at an industry wide, I think for electronic components, you are seeing price pressures there. So I think over the course of the year, you expects, I think, some increases on those components there. We can mitigate that to some extent with some of these longer term contractual arrangements. So that is a pressure point, if you like on our cost side. And then freight, definitely as Nick mentioned, that remains pretty elevated. And for a number of reasons, and just really even getting slots and so on, that's a freight. That\u2019s even into even containers now for [indiscernible]. So that I think we will continue some -- probably for this year. With that, you think -- I don't think the freight is going to be [indiscernible] I think that will resolve itself over time. But I think for the over the course of this fiscal, I think that's going to remain as a cost pressure for us. Rob Douglas : If I just pick up on the price topic, very quickly, I think Mick has covered in broadly quite well. But if you think of our industry, it's historically been a price down industry, right. And that's because reimbursements come down, and prices come down, because we as manufacturers have been able to drive down the materials and move the industry in that direction while preserving margins. Our customers still are very constrained on their ability to pass on any price increases that they face, because for the most part, they're either have government reimbursement or they have some sort of contracted reimbursement with a commercial payer. And those reimbursements have remained static or come down over time. So as we think about what we might be able to do pass price forward, we have to be very thoughtful about how we accomplish that if we can do it. And then couple that with the fact that we're also in contracts with most of our customers, right? So we might be in a tender contract with the government payer or many of our larger customers. We've contracts around for 12 months, that have a renewal cycle and that sort of thing. So I think that we've done very good job of being disciplined in pricing and maintaining price stability. And we'll be very, very thoughtful as we think about any kind of price changes that we do over time. But I think the circumstances are quite unique. And we really want to preserve long standing relationships with our customers who are really our partners in the channel. Chris Cooper : Perfect. Thanks a lot. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Chris. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning. Well, I'd like to continue with that line of thought. You mentioned there that with some of the larger customers, obviously, you've got contracts with them. Can you talk a little bit about whether those contracts with those larger customers to what extent they might have volume pricing in terms of that wholesale price? Is that with more volumes going through? Is that likely to squeeze margins further? Mick Farrell : Jim, I'll hand that question to you. It's a follow up really to your response to the previous question. Yes, that\u2019s a terrific question. And we're actually in many way -- in many cases working through those contract negotiations in real time, I think that we have pretty good clarity with most of our customers that this is an unusual set of circumstances. And so we have a number of customers. And this varies a lot by geography, for everybody to understand. But we have we do have a number of customers who have, need volume based or rebate -- volume based rebates or pricing levels. And this is an unusual set of circumstances that drive more volume into those accounts. And so those are contracts we're working through in real time, but they're not uncapped discounts. And we're managing those conversations, I think very carefully. This is in a way, the flip side of the previous question where because we have relationships with customers who understand the dynamic of what's going on, we're able to negotiate pretty, pretty good price stability. So there's no risk for us of runaway in a sort of runaway discounts and rebates. And on the other hand, we're, working to create a kind of a stable pricing environment for our customers as well. Lyanne Harrison : Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Lyanne. Operator : Next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Low : Thanks. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to meet on mass resupplied, we had load or I had worried that with the recall that we might see a lot of patients stop using their device, particularly given that was the advice. And that would have a flow on effect to everyone's resupply programs. Now we can see the numbers today and then [multiple speakers] growth, obviously, it's not matching up with device sales growth by any means. And I know there's a lot of factors in that. But just wonder if you could talk to that risk and what your expectations are on that front, please. Mick Farrell : Yes, David, there was some confusion after the June 14 announcement, but I think many of the regulatory authorities and many of the clinician groups came out pretty quickly to say, let's talk to you doctor and work out a risk pathway between now and when you get that replacement device from that competitor. And also, for new patients, the doctors and certainly all of us in the industry we're very focused on the safe and effective therapies from ResMed and other players in the market. And so I think that that messaging was actually pretty quickly put out there by those physician societies and relevant health authorities after somewhat confusing announcements, right on that June 14 from our competitor. And so long-term, there's been some impacts that are quite beneficial in patients making that trade off. And certainly for us, you saw plus 5% growth in masks in the quarter for the U.S., you saw plus 24% growth in Europe, over a COVID [indiscernible] there, but very, very solid growth in our mask business. As you said, there's a bunch of factors, David, that this time last year, we had all the ventilation Mark sales, because it in the U.S which was, you know, a confident we were was like a headwind. And the other headwind, we had was the annualization of the snap acquisition, which we did just before COVID, we closed it just in that sort of February through June period. And then, there's some balancing of inventory and cash flow due to the competitive recall all going on at once. And so a lot of competing dynamics, but as you saw, it's a resilient business. When people getting great sleep apnea therapy, they love feeling better, sleeping well and waking up refreshed, and they want to get a new mask every three or six months. And they're doing it at increasing rates due to COVID, that step change has remained. And we're confident, we look through the fiscal year that we're going to see, mid single-digit up to high single-digit growth. In our mask business and it's all about us engaging with those, those patients getting new patients on board. As we talked about some incremental revenue opportunities, they're on the devices, maybe some of the masks, and then we get back to where we were before, right. And we go back to engaging patients, ensuring they stay on therapy, and they have really quick and easy access to resupply, if they want it and when they want it, and when it's covered by insurance and co pays and everything. David Low : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Next question comes from Matthew Mishan with Keybanc. Please proceed with your question. David Low : All right. Good afternoon, guys. And thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, just to switch it up for at least one question. Are there any meaningful milestones for Propeller or Verily -- or the Verily JV in FY '22 that you could that you would like to call out, and as the loss is a lower loss on the JV, because it's now generating some revenue. David Low : Thanks, Matthew. And it's great to have a question that sort of looking out beyond the next 12 months, given the dynamics I'm not surprised by that. I'll take the first part on the joint venture with Verily and hand to Jim to talk a little bit more about Verily and also about Propeller and other great development opportunities we have across our portfolio in sleep and respiratory care. Yes, firstly, the joint venture with Verily. Its name -- now its Primasun. And so we've got the branding out there. And we have Jonathon Lobbins, fantastic CEO that comes to us from Edwards Lifesciences, and other large med tech companies that he's been a part of, and really exciting to have a new CEO there. He's a strong leader, and the ability to identify, engage and enroll. What I call sleep concerned consumers into a digital pathway and a treatment pathway for sleep apnea is incredible and some really good experiments happening in certain metropolitan statistical areas with that technology and so great to have a new leader and the opportunity. The milestones are really around those MSIS and the success we're having before will scale. And obviously, given the current industry dynamics, we don't need to drive demand right now. We have unprecedented, almost unlimited demand, but we're doing lots of pilots and lots of testing and I can see as we get towards our 2023 and we analyze all this and we're moving towards that 2025 strategy. That Primasun joint venture will create incredible opportunities to identify and engage and enroll the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate and want to find a pathway to treatment for their sleep apnea. Jim, any other thoughts about Primasun or Propeller or any other great developments you've got on the horizon in SRC [ph]? James Hollings :  I would say just in specific to Propeller, we remain very excited about Propeller as a part of our portfolio. And, like a lot of number of things, over the last 18 months, the headwinds for Propeller were largely driven by their customer base, focusing on COVID. So, a big part of Propeller's business is working with payers and with health systems to drive adoption of their digital solutions, and there was just distraction in their customer base for many months, obviously. So we're starting to see some more traction in those conversations as COVID starts to decline, and the market starts to stabilize. And we've taken the opportunity during that span to do to continue to develop our capabilities in Propeller and I would say -- just a couple of highlights, I would say, we've added quite a lot of muscle to the commercial side of that business by adding talent into the business. And we've also been working hard behind the scenes to build out the cloud architecture and make sure that Propeller's cloud architecture is paired up really nicely matching and kind of aligned with ResMed's overall cloud architecture for our other digital offerings. And all of that kind of investment is just going to accelerate Propeller's traction in the market as we continue to accelerate digital offerings across our entire portfolio. So we're very excited about it. I think that material revenues out of Propeller are a couple of years away in all likelihood, but as we get more milestones and do things like sign contracts we will keep everybody apprised. Operator : Thank you. We are now approaching the 75 minute mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks, Rob and thanks to all of you for sticking around a little long. Clearly some unique circumstances in this perfect storm. Thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call today. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work helping people breathe better, sleep better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today, and every day, and thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this global private crisis, including patient care provider support and hospitals, production, global supply chain management, distribution, and tech service. Once again, thank you. And I'd like to thank all of you, our shareholders for joining us here and we'll see you in 90 days. Thank you very much. Great. Thanks, Mick and thank you again for joining us today. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our call. Rob, you may now close it up. Operator : This concludes ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. We ask that you please ask one question then return to the queue during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for ResMed. Please go ahead, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. With me on the call today are ResMed's Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep & Respiratory Care business; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our first quarter results demonstrate strong performance across our business, buoyed by extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as continuing recovery of many markets from COVID-19. We achieved double-digit growth at both the top and bottom line metrics of our business. I want to be clear that achieving these results has not been easy this quarter. We are dealing with an unprecedented what I would call perfect storm of elements, including the COVID recovery, but also including a competitor recall that's \u2013 a recall that's ten-fold higher than any in the industry to date, and supply chain constraints that are impacting not only our industry but multiple industries worldwide. I'm incredibly proud of ResMedians across our global teams, many of whom are working 24x7 to get our products and solutions into the hands of patients who need them most. Despite these extraordinary efforts, we know that we have not been able to meet all of the demand. As the market leader, our competitor, that is in the number two market share position, announced a recall mid-June that has created unprecedented dislocations in the market. In effect, we are facing the challenge of providing the volume for our own number one market share position and also trying to meet as much of their number two market share position as possible around the world. Given the supply chain crisis, our suppliers have been allocating components to us on the inbound side. We have, in turn, been forced to allocate our products on the outbound side to our customers. We have been clear on the guiding principles for that allocation of our products, namely that we are giving priority for production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. The allocation conversations that I have with our customers are the same ones that I am having with my suppliers and their suppliers and so on up the supply chain. As an example, during the quarter, I was on a Zoom call with one of our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, and I'm not kidding. We achieved our goal with that manufacturer. And we received increased allocation from that manufacturer. But then we face the challenge and are still facing it of working with the five customers of theirs, all the way down that chain to get to us to ensure that the agreed upon increased allocation of that component actually gets to ResMed, gets manufactured into ResMed products and then sent to ResMed customers and ultimately to patients. That's just one example of a high degree of difficulty dive for our supply chain team. The supply chain analysis and negotiations are ongoing, and the situation is very fluid, changing day by day, week by week and month by month. We have an incredible Six Sigma Black Belt laden team of supply chain specialists working on these issues 24/7. In short, supply bottlenecks continue to restrict our access to critical electronic components, especially semiconductor chips that ultimately limit our net production output. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of seafreight and airfreight from manufacturing facilities to distribution warehouses and ultimately, the customers are increasing our costs and further impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we want to the huge demand for ResMed products. The combination of component shortages and transportation bottlenecks makes providing steady and smooth flow of products to the market very difficult. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We will continue to coordinate with all stakeholders as the situation develops. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and the most important customer, the patient. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, for COPD, for asthma and for other chronic respiratory diseases as well as critical out-of-hospital care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need, where they need it and when they need it. Let's now discuss the overall market conditions in our industry. We are seeing a steady ongoing recovery of demand in the countries that we operate in. They remain at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of new patient flow. We are still seeing a divergence in total patient flow and sleep lab capacity from 75% to 95% of pre-COVID levels in some countries, up to 100% plus of pre-COVID levels in others. These metrics will continue to ebb and flow as vaccines and boosters roll out globally and as new variants of the coronavirus arise and cause temporary perturbations. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state and city governments as well as local health systems, hospitals and health care providers to supply the ventilators, the masks and the training for acute care and the transition home for affected patients. Let me now update you on our three strategic priorities as we pivot back to grow our core business. These three are one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. In August, we launched our next-generation device platform that we call AirSense 11 into the United States market. In short, that launch has been very successful. We will be introducing the AirSense 11 into additional countries very soon. Our market-leading R&D team accelerated the launch of this amazing innovation. First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers, and then accelerating to an earlier full product launch date to bring this product to market faster. Globally, we continue to sell our market-leading legacy platform, the AirSense 10, to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and by levels available for customers. Clearly, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. It's still early into the SirSense 11 launch, but initial customer feedback, combined with the detailed responses to our controlled product launch, tells me that the AirSense 11 is another success for ResMed. Physician, provider and patient feedback are all very positive. I was able to attend the California Sleep Society meeting in person, actually, during the quarter, and I was able to observe firsthand the responses to the latest innovations on the AirSense 11, such as personal therapy assistant, care check-in and the incredible rate of uptake of the patient-centric app called myAir, which has been upgraded for AirSense 11. And the uptake on that is almost double what it was for the myAir app than the AirSense 10. What's clear to me is that this platform, the AirSense 11, benefits not only patients and their bed partners, in addition, the device and software combination benefits physicians, it benefits providers and it benefits payers as well as entire healthcare systems with more data, more insights and better outcomes. As a 2-way digital health comms platform with many technical features that represent significant therapeutic advances, AirSense 11 is not only easy to set up and use, it also offers a very rich patient-centric experience. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology that is able to increase patient adherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within healthcare providers and physicians own health systems. We are engaging with patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. This is a critical part of the ResMed 2025 strategy, as presented at our Investor Day, which we held virtually during this last quarter. Another key aspect of our long-term growth is linked to the awareness and the increasing flow of sleep apnea patients. With 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, this work is critical to our mission. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and remote care, including home-based sleep apnea tests. We want to support seamless and cost-effective approaches to sleep diagnostics. We want to scale technology that in our consumer markets enables an easy-to-use device experience and technology that, in our reimbursed markets, can be a low-cost, clinically reliable, screening tool for sleep apnea. In this vein, on October 1, we closed a transaction to acquire EctoSense, a leader in cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology from Belgium. We believe EctoSense's digital and easy-to-use solutions in the hands of both physicians and sleep lab technicians, as well as consumers can help significantly increase sleep apnea diagnosis rates, as well as general sleep awareness. EctoSense will operate within our sleep and respiratory care business unit, and we're excited to bring this innovative technology to more global markets as we move forward. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our long-term goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and high flow therapy offerings. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and beyond was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the United States where physicians and providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with our strategy to ensure priority for manufacturing and delivery of the devices that meets the needs of those patients, specifically those that need life support ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, including by level support, first. We are balancing the growth in the respiratory care demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the coronavirus pandemic as well as customers as they balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been very helpful to physicians not only during COVID, but it is increasingly valuable on an ongoing basis for them and the health care systems that they operate in. In the not-too-distant future, I can see AirView becoming standard of care for patients on home-based ventilation protocols in many health care systems. Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment as well as facility-based and home-based care settings. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products, and we continue to grow with customers as they utilize our software and data solutions, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates of patients improve across SNFs and other facility-based care settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID cases ebb and flow at slower and slower rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for technology investments in these SaaS verticals, which provides opportunities for us to increase our new customer pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease. As we look at our portfolio of software solutions, we expect SaaS revenue to accelerate, increasing from mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are uniquely positioned, and we have created differentiated value for ResMed with our SaaS portfolio. We are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing innovation investments, commercial excellence partnerships and future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as selective tuck-in M&A opportunities. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved respiratory medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. We are transforming out-of-hospital care at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology. With over 10 billion nights now, 10 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 15.5 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide, we are unlocking value from these data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better healthcare in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that goal this quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these ongoing and unprecedented times. You, our ResMed team, have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with COVID-19, with those emergency needs these last 18 months. And you are now and you have now already pivoted back to provide ongoing support for all of our customers during some of the most challenging industry dynamics that we've seen in the industry. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open the call up for Q&A. Brett? Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase of 20%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 19%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels experienced in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. In the September quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand was approximately $4 million compared to $40 million estimated incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the September 2021 and September 2020 quarters, our global revenue increased by 25% on a constant currency basis. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. In relation to the impact of our competitors' recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $80 million to $90 million in the September quarter. Taking a look at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were $491 million, an increase of 22%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $315 million, an increase of 23% and or an increase of 21% in constant currency terms. By product segment, US, Canada and Latin America device sales were $276 million, an increase of 40%. Masks and other sales were $215 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $218 million, an increase of 24% or in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $97 million, an increase of 21% or in constant currency terms, an 18% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 31%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 44% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Software as a Service revenue for the September quarter was $98 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. For the balance of fiscal year 2022, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the ongoing launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform into additional markets and geographies and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, as reported last quarter, while we are working hard to increase manufacturing output, we will not be able to meet the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. As Mick discussed earlier, we're operating in a very dynamic supply chain environment. Based on the latest information available, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors' recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in Q1. In particular, we now do not see any improvement in our component supply position until our fourth quarter of FY 2022. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 270 basis points to 57.2% in the September quarter compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher manufacturing and freight costs, ASP declines and unfavorable currency movements, which has been partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $177 million, an increase of 11% or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10% compared to the prior year period. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.5% compared to the 21.1% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2022. R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million, an increase of 10% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solutions development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2022. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 18%, underpinned by strong revenue growth. During the quarter, we finalized the deed of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, covering transit pricing audits for the years 2009 through 2018, and also agreed on transfer pricing principles for the future. In anticipation of this settlement, we had previously estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $249 million, net of credits and deductions in our FY 2021 financial results. In relation to the conclusion of the settlement in the current quarter, we recorded an additional GAAP tax expense of $4 million associated with lower tax credits, which were driven by foreign currency movements. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 21.3%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $222 million, an increase of 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51, an increase of 19%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $204 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.39. We had negative cash flow from operations for the quarter of $66 million due to the payment of $285 million to the Australian Taxation Office associated with the deed of settlement. After adjusting for this payment, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter September totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $61.2 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.4 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to report equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2022 associated with the joint venture operations. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $276 million. At September 30, we had $806 million gross debt and $530 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had almost $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as [indiscernible] Health and EctoSense, an acquisition we made on October 1. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, I'd like to now turn the call back over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting your question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. Matthew Mishan : Good afternoon and I hope everyone is doing well. Mick, the first question is how do you ensure that your devices are going to new patient fits versus a replacement device for Phillips? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Matthew. Well, it's easy in markets where we're fully vertically integrated, like Germany, South Korea, and other markets worldwide Australia, New Zealand and others and we're able to work directly with those patients and the doctors to make that happen. It is more difficult in other markets like France or the US where we've worked through providers. But it's been pretty clear from our competitor there that they want people to go and register the devices, and they're going to focus, they said 12 months on just replacing those devices. And frankly, that's theoretical and legal duty to go do that. And so they are laser-focused on that. And so our work is to make sure -- we see the demand from patients directly in those vertically integrated markets and through distributors. And we're pretty confident that the vast, vast, vast majority of our devices go to new patients. There may be some going to replacement patients who are going online or going through certain aspects to get around and go faster than the Philips process, but certainly, the vast majority are going to new patients. The challenge for us is that the demand of being the number one player and also covering as much of the demand of the number two players as possible. We've reached the capacity of those critical components coming in the front end. And so we're not even able to meet all of that new patient demand with -- due to those supply chain constraints. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Cooper : Thanks for taking my question. Look, Mick, I know when you set the guidance of $300 million to $350 million for the recall, you were sort of unable to quantify masks and reluctant to do so. I was just hoping for an update today on whether you are seeing, in fact, any associated benefit on your mask sales due to the significant increase in CPAP that you've seen in the quarter? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Chris. It's a great question. And as you know, we don't provide detailed guidance and we sort of went further than we ever did because of the wide variety of sell-side estimates of what the incremental revenue could be. And we gave that last quarter. We gave that $300 million to $350 million device rough guidance, right? It's not perfect because we're predicting 12 months out in a very uncertain environment. And as Brett just reiterated, we're sticking with that, knowing that we actually had $80 million to $90 million during this quarter that comes out of that, right, and then we've got the remainder to go fight for those components and be able to deliver that over the next nine months. In the mask side, it's a very complicated story, and there's a number of moving factors, and we can get into this, and I can handle Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Sleep & Respiratory Care, can give further detail on this question or if there's a follow-up question on it. But what I can say on mask is we're not going to give public guidance around it, but there's a number of moving factors. You saw our mask growth during the quarter, it was globally at 8%, and the US market was around 5%. The headwinds we have is that, while our number two competitor is not serving as many new patients as they should, and we're not able to take all that demand, there are less new patients being set up. And ResMed -- no matter what the device was, ResMed had a very good, well above 50% uptake rate of those new masks on new devices, no matter who was the manufacturer. And so that's a headwind for our business if there's a new patient that's not getting any therapy. And then the tailwinds would be, which are not as high in volume, but the tailwinds would be that when it is a ResMed device, there is a higher probability because they're designed to work together, and they are working better together and a doctor who loves our devices often likes our masks and same with the sleep technician and the sleep therapist and a respiratory therapist, they often like the brands across the technology spectrum and ResMed's the leader in that we do get a very good uptake on that. So there's some upgrade on the adherence rate to a ResMed device, but there's a headwind of -- even with a competitor device, if there's no device out there, there is less mask sales happening. And thus, you have the sort of 5% growth in the US masks, while we're limited on the ability as an industry to take care of that upfront demand. I think that's about as much color as I can go into it without quantifying it for you. But I can tell you, it's a complex moving equation for us to model at a customer basis and a country level, so I can understand the difficulty for folks on the sell side as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. David Low : Thanks. Mick, if I could just get you to touch on the guidance, the $300 million to $350 million. I mean, given we've seen $80 million to $90 million come through this quarter. Could we just talk a little bit about how you expect this to be phased through the rest of the year, given the supply side constraints, please? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, David. And as I said in the prep remarks, there's a perfect storm hitting the industry. And so there's so many dynamics impacting us that I'm going to call this afternoon working on this. I'm shifting my attention, which usually focuses purely on customers and governments and making sure the demand is there for this is an amazing industry that we serve and sleep apnea and asthma, and I'm spending a lot more time with suppliers. So with that, our best reading of the future flow of components is that, you look at it, and as Brett said in the prepared remarks, that we actually had reasonably good flow, some through inventory and working through that in the quarter of $80 million to $90 million here in the first quarter. It's going to be very difficult here in the December quarter with component shortages and very difficult in the March quarter with component shortages. I do think the components, as we are getting some increased signals and actually doing some great engineering to work around different suppliers and to design in new components. I feel much more confident about the June quarter 2022, so our Q4 fiscal year 2022. And so that's sort of qualitative guidance to it. We're not modeling it out. We've got the $300 million to $350 million. You can subtract off the $80 million to $90 million and model it. But if I was looking at it, it would be tougher in December and tougher in March right now and then freeing up in the June quarter and then September quarter, even more so as some of our new designs and new components get to roll in and we get that flow going. But look, it's changing day by day, week by week. I'm looking forward to my call this afternoon to potentially impact that. But even if I get agreement with someone today, it takes quite a while, as I explained sort of with that example of the five levels deep in the supply chain to get that to flow through from a foundry, to a chip manufacturer, to our factory, to a product, to the warehouse to then be able to sell it to a customer. So I know that's not a specific quantitative guidance, David. It's probably the best I can give you in terms of color for fiscal year 2022. And the hope we have in Q4 and Q1 2023, as we start to see those components really start to free up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Hi, Mick. I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Hey Mick, specifically, on the Philips recall, if I could, could you walks us through the dynamics in the U.S. versus OUS? How sticky are these share gains? And unless our math is wrong, it almost comes across like there is some sort of mix and match on the masks versus the devices. Just give us some additional color. And really what we are trying to understand is, okay, you get $350 million, $400 million, whatever million incremental, how sticky are these? And how do you all plan for this? Thank you for taking my questions. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Suraj. And since I've answered the first three, I'll just correct that our guidance was $300 million to $350 million, not $350 million to $400 million, what you just said, but $300 million to $350 million 0 for the fiscal year. But Jim Hollingshead, you run this business. Do you want to do you give as much as you can on the color to Suraj? Jim Hollingshead : Sure. Thanks, Suraj, for the question. I think it's a very good question. And I'm just going to back up to what we're trying to do in the business, independent of the recall and then talk about the context of the recall. With the launch of AirSense 11, our aim is to put in place a product that once again significantly improves the patient experience and significantly improves workflows and lower costs for providers and also puts us in the position midterm, long-term to improve outcomes. So AirSense 11 is a device that we put on market anticipating long-term share gain. And we have internal goals for that number. And we don't talk about that number publicly, but our plan was to take share with that device. We're launching that device now into a situation where the number two player in the market is out of the market for new patients. And so obviously, we're going to take quite a lot of share, as we can put that product into the market. And we have the two best products on the market in AirSense 10 and AirSense11. So your question is how sticky will that share be? Our goal is to make it quite sticky. But obviously, we have good competitors in this market, and we don't anticipate landing at 100% share, when they recall clears, but we want to have a number that's higher than what it was before we launched AirSense 11, and we're pretty confident we can do that. And just to cap on that, the answer is probably already too long, but to cap on that, I will say that we've managed to take a few points of mass share during the recall as well, and our aim would be to keep some of that share as well. So I think we will emerge from this stronger, than when we entered it. And our offerings are clearly the best offerings on the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now live. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just on U.S. mask, I just wanted to touch a little bit more on that, given that it did disappoint slightly versus expectations. So has there been any change to the ReSupply dynamics in the U.S. market in the quarter? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Gretel. I'll have a go and maybe Jim can join in as well. But I get the ReSupply is actually very strong. We have Brightree ReSupply. We also have Snap technology that has been incorporated into our Brightree platform that has driven incredible ReSupply. If you remember, that really was going strong throughout 2020. So we have some incredibly high comps when you look at the percentage growth rate of masks from this quarter a year ago, even despite COVID hitting this time a year ago, our mask ReSupply and maybe because of that somewhat with the HMEs focusing on it, our mask ReSupply was through the roof this time of a year ago. And even with those comps, we're still achieving some very good rates in ReSupply. As I said, there are headwinds in it when we're not taking care of all new patients and ResMed gets well over 50% of all marks, some new patients, no matter whose device it is in the global market. That's a headwind that we're dealing with while this recall continues. But the tailwinds of ReSupply are actually well incorporated into those figures. And I think if you look outside the U.S. market, look at Europe, Asia and the other 140 countries we operate in, you saw pretty strong 18% double-digit growth in masks in those areas and global growth of around 8%, which is very strong given the headwinds of new patient setups. But Jim, any further color on the U.S. or beyond? Jim Hollingshead : Yeah. I would just say, probably end up repeating some of the key points, but we had a very large comp. And there was a tailwind created by COVID, which is patients, we've talked about this before over the last three or four quarters, but patients are more focused on having clean masks. I mean COVID has created a mentality, if I want a new mask; I want a fresh mask for patients. And then our HME customers in the U.S. have been focused on driving resupply into their installed base of patients. And I actually think that within the context of the Philips recall, driving revenue out of the installed base of patients has once again become quite an important emphasis for our HME customers. And then there are the headwinds. The headwinds of the whole market is not being served, so new patient starts are down. And because we had slower new patient starts during the span of COVID overall, because labs weren't open, there's a little bit of headwind on resupply, because the installed base didn't grow during that period the way we might have anticipated it to. So it balances out. The dynamic inside of the installed base is quite good. So the installed base of patients continue to be resupplied at a very healthy rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live. Craig Wong-Pan: Thanks. Just the question for me was on the different regions, which are trending below pre-COVID levels and which ones are above. Could you just give any color which different markets are and in which category? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Craig. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Rob Douglas : Yes. Thanks, Craig. The issue really is that all of our markets are performing very strongly. The actual recall impacts it global. So we're seeing that really excess demand. And just with different dynamics, as Mick said before, you saw that very strong in the mask on all of it. I actually couldn't call out any particular region and saying it wasn't doing really well. There are specific countries, and sometimes it's local when there's a lockdown, there might be a shortage of diagnosis capacity, and you'll see that. But our teams really run through that and manage around that. And as I said, just to recap, the strong performance was across all countries. Mick Farrell : Yes. And I'll add on maybe just a little bit of color there, Craig. I mean it's hard to say, because you said, what regions, and as Rob said, we can't say what regions. And even if you would ask a more specific question, what countries. It'd be difficult to say there, because in the U.S., there are 50 states with all different regulations, and some of them are 100% plus capacity and some are at 75%, 80% within the state level. And then cities going up and down, and China is not just there. It's different regions there as well. So there are ebbs and flows on a daily, weekly, monthly. But what we can say is on aggregate, it is getting better and better. And it's nice to see some cities, some states, some countries at 100% plus that they're getting through it, they're finding ways to embrace digital health, home sleep apnea testing and remote setup, so that we're able to get the flow of patients going through. Then the challenge we have right now is that we don't have the components of those patients with prescriptions come through to meet all that demand, which is the real critical rate limited right now as well. Thanks for your question, Craig. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live. David Bailey : Thanks very much. Good morning, Mick and Brett. Just as part of the recall, ResMed is going to be getting more exposure through the patient referral network. I'm just wondering if you've had any feedback or observations from physician, DMEs, patients in relation to RedMed's product offering. Just wondering if there's any observations from that group that may have used ResMed less frequently before. Mick Farrell : Yes, David, it's a good question. I think everyone had exposure to ResMed products. We're the market leader, everyone knew the brand name. Everyone had tried it, and we get a large percentage of the prescriptions and actually the share in the 140 countries we operate in. But as you said, there are some doctors who liked a particular aspect or a technical aspect or an emotional aspect really or a workflow aspect of some of our competitors' devices or software systems. And to your question, they are getting, if you like, forced exposure, because it's the only one available for new patients, to ResMed's amazing innovation on the device, the software, the systems and the flow. And if they had some form of prejudice of device from the '90s that they tried or something and have been stuck with the brand, they're now trying a new brand. And I do think, to Jim's point earlier, that some of that brand-new share of somebody who was in another brand's componentry area says, wow, this actually is great. My prejudice was wrong. And I think we will get a lot of that share that we'll maintain forever. And I think certainly, the exposure of patients to the brands and to understand that has increased. I mean, the Net Promoter Score for ResMed amongst patients is rising, and the knowledge about the brands, for better or for worse, through this awful recall is, they're getting to know what device they have. And that awareness is actually good for the whole industry, because I think physicians and providers and technicians have always been aware of the brands and had prescription biases and others that we absolutely influence through our really strong commercial, clinical sales teams. And now we're getting that brand name to new customers as well. So I mean, the short answer to your question is, yes, we've got exposure to new consumers, new physicians, new providers. And we think a lot of that will be sticky because of the value we provide. The brand is the brand that represents 50% lower labor cost if you're setting up a patient when it represents three less clicks to get a report, when it reflects an API that can link into your Epic or your Cerner or your National Health Trust system, really efficiently, it becomes really part of your day-to-day workflow. And that's the type of share that we think is part of the ResMed brand and will maintain our strong growth for a long period to come through for this period. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live. Maggie Boeye : This is Maggie Boeye on for Margaret. I wanted to ask one on gross margins today. I would say that the gross margins for the quarter came in a little bit better than expected, although still contracting. Can you talk about some of the dynamics within that and how you are leveraging the increase in cost given the supply constraints and the freight issues today? And how you are looking at future gross margins specifically in the upcoming quarters? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Brett, I'll hand that question to you. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Hi, Maggie. Yes, the gross margin is pretty consistent with where we were at Q4. And the big impact we're still seeing is on freight costs, that's been really significant. So we've been -- that's a big headwind for us. So that's in it, some FX impacts. I think we've had a deal with which is heading this quarter as well. We were -- we did have a little bit of benefit on product mix with the higher acuity devices. So I think of the level Astral sellers, ASV devices they helped the total product mix this quarter, which helps on the gross margin side. So that was a little bit of a tailwind for us. But having said all that, there's still challenges, still pressures on freight still pressures that will come through on component costs and so on as well. So we need to keep an eye on that, but product mix has been quite good for us and that's helped. Yes. So overall, pretty pleased with how the gross margin ended up for the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Sean Laaman : Thank you. Good morning, Mick. Good morning team. Great set of numbers. Mick, I know you typically don't give sort of much discussion around what you've observed on price in the quarter or on product mix. But that said, you've talked to the supply constraints, yet you've delivered the device numbers that you have. How would you -- or could you help us characterize what you've observed on the price/volume mix somehow in the quarter? Thanks, Mick. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sean. And you're right, we don't provide details around pricing. But look, clearly, this is -- these are unprecedented times, costs. As you saw, and even just in Brett's last answer there around gross margin and going up. Freight costs, I mean, sea freight, there are over 100 ships just two hours north of me here on the I5 stack outside Long Beach that can't get through. So the sea freight inventory sitting there. It's coming through higher cost than it's ever been. Air freight, we have literally chartered planes to fly from Singapore to L.A. and Singapore to Atlanta to get our products to market with this demand. And so those types of things increase costs dramatically. And we have to do that. They're actually consumer planes, but no consumers in them and literally just ResMed device is taking off the seats and overhead, and so that has impacted our costs. One thing we are doing is with AirSense 11, we are launching that with a price premium. It is excellent innovation. It is not just the best in ResMed for eight years, it's the best in the market, I think, ever, as a platform. And so that deserves a price premium, and so we will be extracting that. And look, we have been working with customers and eliminating some certain discounts and rebates and other things that we had used in the past because those don't apply now. And so we're eliminating some of those costs. And look, this is a customer-by-customer, region-by-region discussion that happens on a daily basis with our commercial team. But clearly, we cannot take all of the costs that have been given to us, and we are working with since launch and with appropriate removal of other elements and pricing conditions with customers on a customer basis to address this over time. But our goal -- our laser-focused goal is to make sure we take care of every patient that comes through the channel. And I think that's what you saw during this last quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Frank on for Anthony. Two questions from our side. Number one, what's the reception to Philips' recent US clearance of the replacement the abatement among US DMEs? And then a follow-up. We're hearing a lot on US hospital staffing shortages. Is there a potential tailwind for Matrix Care, or what are some of the dynamics there looking ahead for the rest of the year? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the questions, Frank. Look, I actually have no idea what customers are thinking of the replacement phone versus the replacement devices for our competitor. That's their job to take care of that. If I was a patient, I'd want to replace a device. I wouldn't want to replaced phone. That's what I'd say. But I have no idea on that. It's a very, very lack of strong communication that I've seen publicly on that. And I can tell you, as N equals one, I have nothing to add to that. But on the US hospital front, I do think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we are seeing facilities-based SaaS -- the census rates at skilled nursing facilities are starting to pick up the numbers of patients in beds is picking up. And we actually think -- as you said, that there's a pent-up demand for technology to help with that. But Rob, do you have any further color on MatrixCare and the Brightree home health and hospice? Rob Douglas : Absolutely. It's actually an underpinning of our SaaS strategy that it's been a long-term issue that getting the right staff and keeping them and dealing with the cost of training them and getting staff who are providing really good patient experience has been a big challenge for all of these care providers, not just hospitals. And so we believe that our technology solutions actually make life better for the staff, make it easier for them to do the job, easier to get trained, and more likely to stay on the job and also more efficient. So, staffing challenges actually are another driver of our strategy, just like as Jim mentioned earlier, the concerns about cleanliness and respiratory health are a driver of our core sleep strategy, these staffing shortages and challenges do drive our SaaS strategy long-term. And long-term, that will be a tailwind for the business. Many, many short-term factors going on there. But we've -- as Mick said earlier, we're seeing good improved performance despite challenging times, particularly for skilled busing facilities across our SaaS businesses. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live. Steve Wheen : Thanks. Good afternoon Mick. I just wanted to ask, I imagine it's quite difficult to differentiate what sales of devices are relating or going into the Philips opportunity versus the organic growth of your business. But if I do strip out the $90 million out of your device revenues for this quarter and then strip out the $40 million of vent sales in the PCP, you're getting in excess of 20% growth. Is that how you characterize what's going on with the new patient starts? Mick Farrell : Steve, thanks for the question. And yes, good morning to you there in Australia. I think you're not wrong that we would have very strong double-digit growth. And that actually makes sense and has traditionally happened when we launch a new product like the AirSense 11 as our first platform launch in eight years. And as I said in my prep remarks, I mean, I'm blown away by things like the personal care system, watching the care check-in personal therapies or watching the sleep technicians and sleep doctors live at that California Sleep Society engage not just with the presentation from the marketing teams, but then sitting down with the clinical teams and walking through this device, I think it's a device that deserves to take double-digit growth and take a lot of share. And so I think your calculations there are spot on in terms of this is a double-digit growth time for ResMed in the device space irrespective of this competitive recall, irrespective of the comps that we had around COVID and vents and the tailwinds of vents and headwinds of sleep apnea patients coming in a year ago that we're seeing really strong growth of the sleep space. And as Jim said earlier, our goal is to entrench people in these amazing workflows that have lower costs and better outcomes and drive therapy to patients in ways never seen before. The part that I'd highlight is this huge take-up of patients signing on to Mya and having a personal relationship with their therapy through the smartphone with Mya is at unprecedented levels. I'm talking double the uptake of AirSense 10. That's one of the highlights that I think has been missed through this. So, Steve, thanks for the question and the opportunity to highlight that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is now live. John Deakin-Bell: Thank you. I was just hoping to get a little more color on where you think the sleep testing capacity is in the market. Are we back to pre-pandemic levels? So just give us a little more color on new patients and where you think that is kind of trended over the last couple of quarters. Mick Farrell : Great question, John. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, John. As we said in Mick's prepared remarks, testing capacity is mostly back to normal. I would say, in the US market, we're mostly back to normal, and there's actually probably some upside into that because a number of sleep labs increasingly during the COVID crisis, home sleep testing was more readily adopted by sleep labs and maybe would not have taken it on before. And so probably -- you still probably got slightly fewer people going to labs but a much broader use of home sleep testing. And I think in general, you can say in the US, testing capacity is back to normal, maybe a little bit up, although the shape of it looks a little bit different. And then other reasons, it's really -- it varies quite a lot by what's happened with the Delta variant, what's happened with health care systems. But in general, I would say new patient starts in, say, Europe, are coming back to pre-COVID normal. Some countries are a little bit different. And in some cases, you've still got health systems that are a little bit backed up, right? So especially in hospital-based systems the diagnosis may be back up, but the actual capacity to set patients up on therapy may be now a bit of the bottleneck. So there's pent-up demand and things like that. But I would say, in general, we're almost back to normal. And I would add to that, one of the reasons we decided to move forward with the acquisition of Ectosense is that we really want to make it much easier for patients to understand whether or not they have a sleeping issue. So in some markets Ectosense will be used as a screener. And in some markets, Ectosense is already used as a diagnostic tool. But the patient experience with that technology is really, really simple, really easy to do. And so we're working with that acquisition to open up the funnel even further. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about inventory levels a little bit, both at ResMed and also at the distributors. So in your balance sheet, I see higher inventory levels compared to last quarter. Can you talk about what that might mean for device sales going into second quarter? But then also, if we look at the different regions you're operating in, from our perspective, we're seeing greater bottlenecks at set up in the United States than in Europe. So do you have a sense of what inventory levels are like with your distributors between the United States and Europe? Mick Farrell : So that's a great question, Lyanne, and quite detailed. I'll hand the first part of the question about ResMed's inventory and what's been happening with the build up there to, Brett. And then I'll hand the second part about the inventory at the HMEs, HCPs and distributors, as they call them in Europe, between the US and Europe to Jim Hollingshead. So Brett, over to you first, and then Jim Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Hi, Lyanne. Yes, on the inventory that -- a lot of that field reflects the components of raw materials part of our inventory. And we're really -- it's really in response, I think, to the elongation of supply chains and the bottlenecks and congestions that we're seeing. We are looking to support production for any upside in electronic components. So it says there's a lot of components that are ready to go once we get electronic components. So we've been pretty deliberate on that. We're looking to increase safety stocks as well, really just trying to deal with these supply disruptions. And the other big one we're seeing is that just with the increased sea freight, air freight, lead times, it's sort of blowing out to two, up to four weeks. So that's kind of more inventory that we're carrying, and I think probably a lot of companies will see that as well. So those logistics delays, I think, are causing a lot more, what I call, stock in transit coming through as well. So it's a combination of those factors. We're also running, for example, the dual AS 10, AS 11 platforms, and that's really there to support demand into the market. So we're doing that as well, which might be a little more unusual than what we would typically do. So the combination of those factors is really driving up our inventory levels a little bit low. Inventory days have been reasonable. So that's really trying to support overall production when we get those components in, I think, is the crux and the thesis there. Operator : Our next question today is coming... Mick Farrell : Hold on. Sorry, Jim is going to answer the second part of that. Jim Hollingshead : I'll just add to Lyanne's -- no, that's fine. I'll just add to second half of Lyanne's question, which is, I think it's very safe to say that our customers and distributors have very little inventory. They are running right now, I think, with unusually low inventory levels. And so when you take the number two manufacturer out of the market and you under serve the market, it creates a very, very difficult situation. So we're reporting what we think is obviously a strong quarter, but we are working frantically to lift our manufacturing supply and deliver product to market. And as an industry, the manufacturers in this industry are under-serving demand. And so it's put our customers in a very difficult situation, and they're frustrated and we understand that they're frustrated. And we're doing the very best we can to build products as fast as we can and deliver it as fast as we can because we know that the market is undersupplied, and it's putting our customers under a great deal of pressure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Thanks very much, guys. Apologies, if the line a bit crackly. But Mick, just a quick question on SaaS, you mentioned growth increasing to the upper single digit by the end of fiscal 2020. Can you just talk to what the drivers of that increase are what the key drivers of that uplift are likely to be give you that confidence? Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks. I'll start and hand to Rob maybe for some further details. Look, we have Bobby Ghoshal, our new President of the SaaS division. And I can tell you, he's hitting the ground running these last five weeks. He's been in there. And certainly, we're seeing some great opportunities for accelerating growth. I think, look, the externalities that I talked about in the prep remarks that we covered earlier, that skilled nursing facility census is coming back, so demand is coming back. And we see the book, the pipeline book starting to build up. And in a SaaS business, that's great because when the pipeline builds up, you get the conversions and then it turns into revenue. So we get pretty good visibility, even three, six, nine months out to seeing sort of an acceleration of growth. So I feel pretty confident that those census rates and others that census rates are going up and that we are going to see with MatrixCare is really good products, growth in the MatrixCare business to start accelerating there. In addition, Brightree and Snap, although they're annualizing some of the acquisitions of Snap, we're seeing really good adoption of those resupply and some really new innovative tools that the Brightree R&D team are bringing to market. And Bobby was previously COO there and has a good knowledge of that. I think that will accelerate throughout the rest of the fiscal year. But Rob, there's so many -- the eight verticals there. What other elements do you have reasons to believe they can accelerate this business? Rob Douglas : I think you've covered many of them, Mick, but also there's a real execution focus on the team, and we're really confident that they're driving execution. Mick mentioned the innovation. There's a strong innovation mentality in that team. And we've got great new offerings and great new ideas coming to market as well as really streamlining our focus. And a lot of it's also execution on the sales front and having the sales team being able to build the pipelines and then increasingly doing face-to-face visits in getting these deployments underway as things ease up. So we've got a lot of confidence in that business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live. Dan Hurren : Good morning. Thanks very much. Just looking at the fourth quarter, you guided to this $300 million to $350 million. And at that time, you were quite explicit that we should not expect the uplift until the second half. And now today, you're suggesting uplift comes in first quarter and fourth quarter, and you delivered almost what, 30% of that total up 54% in the first quarter alone. So \u2013 and on top of that, Brett, has just said you've got the small material inventory build. So can you explain what has \u2013 what's changed since then? And why \u2013 what mechanics of this drop off in second, third quarter would be? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks, Dan. So look, it's a complex and moving dynamic. But the rate-limiting step here is electronic components and specifically the semiconductor chips from a particular manufacturing and a supply chain that, I know the names and the people and them talking to them to try and get this supply. The trouble is that there are multiple other industries. And demand for semiconductor chips that are through the roof. And obviously, everyone on this call follows many other industries. You've heard this, we're not alone in medical device industry, automotive industry, consumer communications industry, even consumer products are often cloud connected now and have these limitations. So look, things haven't gone better these last 90 days in terms of supply. They've got very difficult. And our visibility, as I look at the June quarter, I feel very confident in the semiconductor chips coming through. But in December and March, it's hand to mouth of these devices and chartering planes and working with redesigns to make sure the semiconductor chips go so much in. And so our best reading of the dynamics, even though we feel in aggregate, that $300 million and $350 million, which is which is a pretty broad range in itself and has some plus or minus on the top and the bottom end of it, that we feel stronger on that June quarter with the supply that we see coming through, whereas it's not as strong. I'm closer to the December one now, and I know it's going to be tough and March as well. But look, things can change on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month. And what we're doing is we're being as open as we ever have around supply chain as open as we ever had and transparent about sort of the variability, if you like, of the flow of these components that come in. I can tell you though, we get one more chip, it goes into one more device and goes to one patient. And that's the truth. There is no stockpiling of this inventory. It goes all the way straight through to production. And we have an incredibly efficient plan in Singapore and also in Sydney and also manufacturing in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are not constrained on our internal capacity. As soon as that part comes in, that rate-limiting bottleneck part, it goes on to a product, gets to a customer. And that's what we are focused on. And I'm giving as much color as I can qualitatively around that. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Farrell for any further closing comments. Mick Farrell : Well, thanks, Kevin, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for staying on an extra five to seven minutes here and joining us on this call. I'd also like to thank once again the 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders who listen to this call for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this crisis, patient care, technical service, sales teams working with customers every day, but I'd like to add a special call out to our amazing teams on the front lines of supply chain, management production, distribution, all of you are heroes. Every chip you get is a patient's life change. So, I look forward to talking with you all again all of our stakeholders here in 90 days. Thank you. I'll turn the call back to Amy to close out. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our first quarter 2022 call. Kevin, you may now close this out. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Our discussion today may also include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed\u2019s future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that are made today. I'll now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strong performance across our business, benefiting from the ongoing extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, as well as the steady recovery of markets from the peaks of COVID-19 impacts. We achieved double-digit growth in our business as we navigate three major externalities. On, the recovery of patient flow post the COVID maximum peaks; two, global supply chain constraints, particularly in electronic components; and three, the almost unlimited demand associated with a competitor recall that has actually extended further in terms of volumes of their devices that were impacted and the duration of their repair and replace process. The bottom line is we have at least 12 more months of this incredible demand for ResMed products. I'm very proud of 8,000 ResMedians serving patients in 140 countries worldwide. Our global teams are finding ways to deliver products and solutions to home care providers, physicians and healthcare systems, and ultimately into the hands of patients who need them most. Clearly, the global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries and we are not immune to its impact. During the quarter, despite growing double-digits year-on-year, we were not able to meet all the demand available in the market. We are being allocated components from our suppliers, particularly electronic components and even more specifically, semiconductor chips. And we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers. We have established an allocation process with clear guiding principles that give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of sea freight and air freight are impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we would like to the demand for ResMed products. Freight costs are increasing across the board on inbound components from suppliers and on outbound products to our distribution centers and for ultimate delivery to our customers. As a result of these increased costs, we implemented a surcharge on our products starting in January to share some of the burden of these increased costs with customers. Given all the increase in prices from commodities to special \u2013 specialty products across multiple industries around the world, the necessity of this surcharge has been understood and accepted by our customers. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything that we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We are also re-engineering designs, validating new parts, pieces, suppliers and accelerating new product launch and development to further catch up with the demand. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems and the most important customer, the patient. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other respiratory chronic diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out-of-hospital health care software solutions. To grow and differentiate our sleep and respiratory care business, we will develop, design and deliver world-leading therapy solutions that can be scaled globally. And we're going to deliver the world's leading out-of-hospital software solutions to empower each person's health care wherever they are. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it. Let me step back to discuss the broad market conditions in our industry. We're seeing steady ongoing recovery of demand across the countries that we operate in. We are still seeing a divergence in the total patient flow from 85% to 100% of pre-COVID levels in most countries, and about 100% of pre-COVID levels in a few locations. These metrics will continue to steadily increase towards pre-COVID levels and beyond as vaccines and boosters roll out globally. Each new COVID variant has an impact. But with the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis, and remote patient setup, and remote patient monitoring, as well as established and well-established processes for COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs, we expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each time. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state, and city governments, as well as local health care systems, hospitals, and health care providers to supply ventilators, masks, and training for acute care, and the important transition home as needed. Given the steadily decreasing severity of each impact on the hospitalizations and severe disease from COVID, the demand for ventilators is now consistent with pre-COVID levels. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma businesses. Number two is to design, develop, and deliver world leading medical devices, as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three is to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. The US launch of our next generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. This new platform has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all-time high demand for ResMed devices. We expect to introduce AirSense 11 platform into additional countries throughout calendar year 2022. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market leading platform the AirSense 10 to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and bilevels [ph] available for sale. In fact, the only product that the AirSense 10 is inferior to is the AirSense 11. As you saw in our results, with double digit growth this quarter, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. With the AirSense 11 platform and our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients, AirView for physicians and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs and we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. We have peer reviewed published evidence showing that combining AirSense platform with myAir software and AirView software, we see over 87% adherence to positive airway pressure therapy. This was in a study with over 85,000 patients. On our latest and greatest platform, AirSense 11, we are driving even higher adoption rates of the myAir than ever before. In fact, we are seeing more than double the uptake of patients signing up to myAir and fully engaging with ResMed software technology. The net result is that this delivers a better patient experience, better efficiency for the homecare providers and more importantly greater long term adherence to therapy. We saw this demonstrated in the Alaska study in partnership with the French healthcare systems where we showed in a study with over 176 patients that those patients who adhered to CPAP therapy had a 39% relative reduction in mortality rates versus control. Demonstrating these types of better patient outcomes and lower costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy. Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene, but also adoption acceptance of digital health and telehealth tools including home-based sleep apnea tests. Although increasing demand is not as important in the immediate short term giving the ongoing competitor recall, we have a long term focus and we're always focused on that long-term demand gen opportunity. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end to end seamless digital experience for patients. As we mentioned in our October call, during the second quarter, we acquired Ectosense, a leading provider of cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology worldwide. We believe Ectosense\u2019s digital and easy to use solutions in the hands of physicians, sleep lab technicians, as well as consumers can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rates can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rights as well as general sleep apnea awareness. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology and high flow therapy offerings, such as our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the US where providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with the guiding principles of our allocation process, namely, to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation and noninvasive ventilation devices, including by levels that meet the needs of these highest acuity patients first. Adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago remains solid, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. AirView for ventilation has provided value by helping physicians and the health care systems they operate in to manage high risk patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is also increasingly being used on an ongoing basis to enhance quality of care through early and proactive intervention at the first sign of respiratory medical issues to help reduce the risk of hospitalization. We see a world where We see a world where AirView ventilation is standard of care for COPD, the way that our core sleep apnea AirView platform is now standard of care for sleep apnea treatment. Let me now review our software as a service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business showed improved sequential growth. We achieved high single digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets including home medical equipment as well as facilities based and home based care settings. The continued growth of home based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment as well as our home health and hospice products and we continue to grow with customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including Brightree and SNAP ReSupply. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some of the verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities as the effects of the highly contagious Omicron variant remains a headwind for patient volumes in these settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID rates peak and then decline with this latest variant as has happened in many regions around the country and around the world. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent-up demand for technology investments, which provides opportunities for us to sell more and more services and solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. As we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to growth to accelerate, achieving sustainable high single digit growth as we exit this fiscal year. As always, our growth, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate and continue to take market share from competitors. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care and we provide mission critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. Our latest and greatest SaaS solutions address the number one issue reported across our customer base which is staffing challenges. Our SaaS customers expect this problem to persist and they recognize the need for technology solutions to help solve their challenges with efficiency and scale and our software services and solutions help them achieve both of these outcomes. We are well-positioned and we have created differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed within our SaaS business. Looking at the broader portfolio of ResMed's businesses across sleep and respiratory care, as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our sleep and respiratory care solutions treat the most prevalent and highest cost chronic conditions and our SaaS solutions support the care settings where people face these and other chronic conditions. With this combination, we can fundamentally transform out of hospital healthcare at a scale that no other company can match. And we have set up for sustainable growth through ongoing investments in R&D to the tune of 7% of our revenues, commercial excellence in partnerships with CVS verily and beyond, as well as future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as tuck-in M&A as we move forward. Our patient centric \u2212 physician centric and provider centric approach combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and beyond. We are transforming out-of-hospital healthcare at scale, leading the market in digital health technology with over 10.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 16 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems. We have invested in the privacy, cloud operations and AI and ML-driven data or analytics capabilities to do this at a scale that is unmatched by competitors, and we are increasing our lead every day. Our mission to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that inspiring goal during this last quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 8,000 residents for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication during these ongoing, unprecedented times. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move to the group for Q&A. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We're pleased with our financial performance in Q2, despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints and the challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the December quarter was $895 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and rest free care products across our portfolio, driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the ongoing product recall by one of our competitors. In the December quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from our COVID-19 related demand, consistent with revenue from our COVID-19-related demand, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. However, we will continue to estimate it for you as appropriate. In relation to the impact of our competitor\u2019s recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the December quarter. For the first half of our FY 2022, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $125 million to $145 million. We continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the total incremental device revenue opportunity to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for the full fiscal year 2022. As we shared last quarter, we expect our fiscal third quarter to remain supply constrained, similar to our fiscal second quarter, therefore limiting incremental revenue during the third quarter. We see supply challenges to some extent easing in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal year 2023. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, sales in the US, Canada and Latin America countries increased by 14%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12% in constant currency terms. By products segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 16%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 19% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. Mask and other sales increased by 9%, Masks and other sales increased by 9%,, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient set ups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 13% in constant currency terms, again reflecting the benefit from incremental revenue due to a competitive recall. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets benefited from improved patient flow relative to the prior year and increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Overall, our Asian operations in particular delivered a strong quarter. Software-as-a-service revenue increased by 8% in the December quarter. We saw strong performance of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the second half of fiscal year 2022, we expect to continue to benefit from our competitors\u2019 inability to supply new patients and from the global fleet markets general recovery from COVID-19 impacts. However, as we have said in the last few quarters, while we are working hard to increase device output, we will not be able to meet all expected demand resulting from our competitors\u2019 recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. We are operating a very dynamic supply chain environment. As I stated earlier, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in the first half of fiscal year 2022. We expect Q3 to remain challenging but Q4 to be better. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 230 basis points to 57.6% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency movements, partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses, during Q2, we maintained a disciplined approach in our ongoing spend to support our operations. But we are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 9% or, in constant currency terms, increased by 10%. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. Importantly, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to 21.2% in the prior-year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the second half of FY 2022. R&D expenses for the quarter increased 14% on both a headline and a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue of 7% compared to 6.9% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product, and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the second half of FY 2022. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 15% while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% compared to the prior year quarter of 15.2%. The relatively low tax rate in Q2 in both the current quarter and prior year quarter reflects a favorable tax benefit associated with employee equity vesting that typically occurs in the second quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 5% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 4%. Now cash flow from operations for the quarter was $220 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the premise on joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2022 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $109.4 million. At December 31, we had $680 million gross debt and $496 million net debt. Our debt levels remain modest and at December 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. As our cash flow and low leverage provide flexibility in how we allocate capital going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as Citus Health and Ectosense, an acquisition we completed on October 1. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Cooper : Afternoon. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Mick, can you just remind us, please, of the specific measures you're employing to mitigate the component supplier challenges? And I guess where you're seeing more and less success. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Chris, thanks. It's a very pertinent question, obviously, and we're pursuing multiple paths, as I outlined in the prep remarks we're focusing on \u2013 the first thing we're doing is going to our existing suppliers and existing supply chains and really imploring them to prioritize medical devices over the other aspects. They have choices to give to electric cars, cellular phones, consumer devices and medical devices. And we are working with them directly on that. We're seeing some benefit on that, certainly at the level of maintaining the sort of double-digit growth that you saw during this quarter. In addition to that, we are redesigning parts and pieces and components within our existing platforms, and we're bringing new platforms to market faster. So we're working on our Air 10 designs and Air 11 designs. We're also re-engineering our supply chains to validate and verify new suppliers to be able to get there. And so that whole combination gives us a lot more confidence that as we look to March quarter to get better than December but then June quarter to get significantly better than March. And then as we go through September and December of this calendar year, we really start to free up a lot of those projects come into play and we're seeing a lot of confidence with them. But you know, over that portfolio, Rob, do you have any more information to provide maybe Chris, around what we're doing with supply chain and parts? Rob Douglas : Maybe only also, Chris, this has sort of been going on for a year now and we knew these shortages were going to be coming. So our teams have been working on all those activities that Nick's been talking about throughout the year, starting to bear fruit. It does take time and that's why we're talking about sort of, you know, things don't fix immediately. We're talking about its continuing to be challenging for this coming quarter and starting to see improvement further out. That said, you know, it's a very dynamic situation and things do change on a weekly basis and so our teams have to be extremely agile and we've got \u2212 we're actually putting a lot of resources into it, got a really strong team of engineers and commercial relationship people with the suppliers and our product teams are all really focused on this as we work through these challenging times. Chris Cooper : So can, I mean, relative to the update you were providing in the last quarter results in October. Are you now more or less confident that the deficits that you're currently seeing in components can be addressed by the fourth quarter? Mick Farrell : Yeah, it's a good question, Chris. I'm actually precisely where I was in October that, you know, I think we said in October it's going to be tough in December, it's going to be tough in March and really start to open up in June and then as we go out throughout the calendar year. So, I stand by that and I stand as Brett said earlier, looking at fiscal 2022 the $300 million to $350 million of incremental product. Look at the December quarter, 16% growth year-on-year in devices amongst a global supply chain crisis, COVID-19 recovery, all the challenges that are here. That\u2019s really strong. But we\u2019re going to get stronger than that as we go throughout the fiscal and as we go throughout the calendar year. This seemingly infinite demand is going to be with us for the whole of this calendar year and potentially beyond that. And so we \u2013 all the projects that Rob talked about, if the starting gun went off sort of June 14, when the competitor put this recall notice in field safety, notices globally out, our team have done a pretty darn good job getting to 16% year-on-year in this crisis on the December quarter. I think it will get \u2013 as I said in October, I think it will get better in March and then December and significantly better in June and then really start to free up as we hit September and December. And with almost infinite demand, you never quite catch up to that. But we're going to get faster and faster and grow more year-on-year as we go throughout the calendar year. Chris Cooper : Thanks very much. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live. Dan Hurren : Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much. Mick, you mentioned that ventilation demand is back at pre-COVID levels, but I presume you're talking about the hospital events or hospital patients. So, I was hoping you can give us some color detail on ventilation into the home healthcare market and specifically how the Astral product has performed whilst the explosion of rains [ph] over the last couple of quarters. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dan. I'll have a first stab at it and then hand to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of Sleep and Respiratory Care. Yeah. So what I\u2019ve said in the prep remarks is that what we're seeing is that the demand for ventilators is really around that COPD neuromuscular disease, respiratory insufficiency markets are where they were pre-COVID-19 pandemic. So that we're seeing that flow of sick patients finding their way through digital health solutions, telehealth monitoring, digital work with their pulmonary and/or COVID cleaning particles in labs for their pulmonary physicians. We\u2019re getting the prescription for those products. The vast majority of our revenues, 90-plus percent globally on respiratory care are out-of-hospital respiratory care. So even Astral and Astellas and WSTs [ph], FTAs, FTs and AFEs, they\u2019re used for ventilation outside the hospital. So those seem to be back in terms of patient flow. Jim, any further color to provide Dan on that? Jim Hollingshead : Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Nick said is that our Astrals product is performing really well in the market. It's got very sophisticated algorithms that can treat a wide range of patients, and demand for it has been really strong. And so, in general, the Astrals have been very well accepted and some of the algorithms we've added over the last several months have driven demand upward. It's also benefiting from the for what is for us to tailwind from the Philips recall. And so, there's a bit of incremental demand for Astral in that context as well. Dan Hurren : Thanks a lot. Thank you. Operator : Guys, your next question is coming from Sean Gorman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Sean Laaman : Dave Pendarvis, do you have any to \u2013 Good morning, Mick and team. Hope you're all right. Well, Mick, I'm hoping we could get an update on the new RTM cuts from CMS and how that might be influencing our Propeller. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Sean. It's a great question, and as you know, Propeller technology is for those who may not know a cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery product for both COPD and asthma, and a lot of those are in pilot stage and the partnerships with governments in Europe and private payers in the United States. And so, we are \u2013 do have some commercial models going. They're not material to the global business, but, Dave Pendarvis, do you have any data about RTM codes that we've got through reimbursement and any impacts on those for Propeller and across the business? Rob Douglas : Yeah. Well, generally, we're happy to see coding and reimbursement flow towards more remote monitoring type activity. That's a positive. At the same time, Propeller is working both to have physician adoption of those codes, and we're working to see the funding come through with that, and nothing changes quickly in terms of medical practice and Propeller is also working with health care systems and other system-wide bases to try to adopt to Propeller system. So, I'd say we're encouraging, but it's still a little early in the day for us to say we're seeing material uptake for Propeller as a result. But certainly, it improves the operating conditions. And we think this is a long-term trend that will benefit Propeller as well as the rest of the business and its remote patient monitoring in the long run. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Sean Laaman : Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Mick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. Matthew Mishan : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. You saw a sequential improvement quarter over quarter in US masks. Can you give us a sense of what the drivers of that are and whether or not you expect continued sequential improvement moving forward? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Matt. And it's great to see US, Canada, Latin America, or the strong 9% constant currency growth on masks and Europe, Asia, rest of world at 11% year on year with a strong double-digit 10% growth. Well, one and as you said, that is up from last year. Look, I think I'll start in maybe hand to Jim for some more color. But at the broad level, COVID-19 has shown the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. And we said this in 2020 when we saw that sort of uptick of the growth of our masks and accessories business. And we just launched Snap and we have rightly resupply and a lot of people thought, well, this is the second was step up, it's just up. While people like, there were people with stockholdings and some commodity products. This is a stockholding issue. We said, no, this is sustainable. We\u2019re talking to patients. We\u2019re doing the net promoter score. We\u2019re analyzing data consumers want and always wanted to more health care. They've now seen the reason for respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. We\u2019re now two years into this and we are seeing sustained growth at the patient level demand for respiratory health, respiratory hygiene. We're adding to that the technology from SNAP, technology from Brightree but in other parts of the world with those technologies aren't there, we're partnering with our home care providers with patients directly and beyond to encourage and make that happen. But Jim, any further color on the sustainability of this, this strong margin? Jim Hollingshead : I think the mix just listed a couple of tailwinds are related to, I do think patients have changed their behavior in the context of COVID and are much more keen to get clean, refreshed consumables and their experience. And I think our customers worldwide have gotten better at providing that and the US market in particular, there's a very strong push on resupply and has been for months. And so that's, that's a tailwind. There's always a Q2 cyclicality tailwind because of deductibles. So that's a normal cyclical thing but the other thing I think is really important to point out is that our mask portfolio is performing really, really well. We have the \u2013 we do have the widest range of masks available to fit really almost any patient experience. We continue to take share, I think, which is a really important dynamic for us. So not massive shocking movement but incrementally, we continue to take a bit of share over the last two or three quarters, we've taken, we've taken sequential share and so that's been really good. The only headwind on mask is the filter recall, because the filter recall is dampening new patient starts. And so that's, that's a tiny headwind against four or five tailwinds that we've just listed and we feel really confident about our mask portfolio going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now live. Craig Wong-Pan: Thanks. Just a question on US device sales. I was wondering if you could provide any comments on the split there between AirSense 11 and AirSense 10 and how that kind of proportion of sales between the two might compare to the first quarter? Mick Farrell : Craig, it's a pertinent question but it's one we don't feel comfortable going into the details of. What I can tell you as an equal one personal user of this AirSense 11 platform is that the delivery is smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected. My wife actually asked me if it was on when I turned it on, it is that much smaller, quieter and better than our last generation already the leading platform. So, what I can tell you is it is taking off every single AirSense 11 we can make is sold that day. It comes out of the factory, it's already pre-sold and they are moving fast. And so it is increasing as a portion of our US sales. For competitive reasons we're not going to split out how quickly that S curve is coming up. But the points I made in the prep remarks are really strong. The AirSense 10 on its own is the second best product in the market after only the AirSense 11. So it is already there and every AirSense 10 we can get component for and then put through the production line get sold as well. So we\u2019re selling both in parallel and customers are demanding both and we'll take both over any of the competition. And so we're driving those out there. We're driving great growth of both and we will do throughout all calendar year 2022 as Philips recall will last at least that long in their update just this week. And so, you know, 90 days ago it was 12 months ending in September. We were ready for that scenario. They'll come back in September and get our great mask uptake as Jim was saying earlier. We're now ready for their new scenario which is December and we're ready to expand our components and our share on the device side and driving as much as that demand as is possible. So, we're ready for all the scenarios of all the above. But yeah, we're not going for all the scenarios that will be involved. But, yeah, we\u2019re not going to break down the exact AirSense 11 versus AirSense 10. I can tell you it\u2019s growing extraordinarily fast. The S-curve uptake is great, and patients are loving it. So, throughout calendar year, we will introduce it to other countries around the world, and we expect the same sort of level of uptake in those other countries. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Paine from CLSA. Your line is now live. Andrew Paine : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanting to get a bit more clarity on your ability to reengineer parts and redesign elements in your devices. How is that going to be achieved, and does this mean you won't be as exposed to chip shortages from 4Q and onwards? And when do you think these changes will allow you to be running at full capacity and, in essence, meeting current demand? Mick Farrell : Yeah, Andrew, great three-part question. I'll start with it, and then maybe, Rob, you can cover anything I missed of Andrew's components there. But, look, yeah, the starting gun went on this project in April when they said there was a quality issue, June when they said there was a recall. We were already ready for the supply chain shortages that COVID-19 would drive, and if this recall from our competitor hadn't happened, we would be able to meet all the existing demand. As you saw, we grew 16% year-on-year in this quarter, and that would have been great growth, taking some good share in the core competitive market. But with that starting gun going off in June, we did start those reengineering projects. We said, look, we are not going to be able to just go back and ask for more supply. We know the supply chain constraints. We know the automotive industry, cellular comms, and others are all screaming for more products, too. And so we started those reengineering of components and parts. We started also reengineering these Six Sigma Black Belts, looking at our supply chain and analyzing different suppliers and revalidating and assuring that we could get them there. And so there's a bunch of projects going on. I run out of fingers looking at them. But when I look at that portfolio, it gives me strong confidence to say, we saw some good \u2013 some of them come to fruition in December some more in March. But in the June quarter, I think a bunch of these projects will free up supply and then you hit September and December and the portfolio projects that are going to get to market in terms of the new supply, a new piece and new redesign will get there. And that's what gives us that confidence in that, that recovery and the amount of share we're going to take through 2022. Rob, what did I miss there? Maybe just going to some of the sort of the reengineering processes. As you know these \u2013 Andrew, these products have hundreds of components in them. And if you're missing one, you can't build any of the products. So you'll actually see us as we build buffers around all of this, we will see our inventory levels of materials go up as we build buffers of these alternatives. Now some of the components they're easy to have as alternatives. You've got to revalidate them. And in the medical device world, you've got to have very rigorous revalidation alternate components. And that's often a lot of the engineering work. But some of the other components like the microcontrollers and things like that, they are a lot more complex. They interact with the embedded software on the systems, all of that type of thing, the design and validation processes for those are more complex and do take more time. We've got projects across all of those areas going on there. And as we make these alternatives, then we're scheduling, the longer term commitments, the relationships with the suppliers, building the inventories and making sure we have options. That said, keep coming back to the sector is a very variable situation. And just when you think you've got everything right, then you start seeing the other components be challenges. So I think as I said earlier, you have to be really agile and keep competing on \u2013 keep running really fast to track these issues. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is now live. John Deakin-Bell: Thank you. I'm just trying to get a bit more color around the underlying the underlying new patients, maybe between US and the rest of the world. And just give us a sense of where you think we\u2019re at in different markets and perhaps some \u2013 since when you think it might get back to the patient growth during the 2019? Mick Farrell : Yeah, John it's a very complex question because as you know, we operate in 140 countries and all the different Greek letter variants of COVID flow through those 140 countries at different rates. One great thing because we have strong visibility and awareness into this as we talk to the pulmonary and critical care physicians and we watch hospitalization rates and ventilation usage rates and ICU usage rates as each variant seems to be \u2013 although more and more communicable less and less severe and the impact in terms of hospitalizations, severe need for ventilatory help and death. And so the work that we did in 2020 and 2021 establishing these digital protocols, home sleep apnea, testing protocols that pulmonary doctors who previously hadn't done telehealth visits are now doing them. Doctors who weren't embracing ApneaLink Air or some of the NOX digital diagnostics components have embraced them throughout 2020 out of necessity and then 2021 out of scale. So as we enter 2022 here, we're feeling very comfortable across those 140 countries. I gave you in prep remarks the sort of wide band, right? 85% to 100% of pre-COVID patient flow, depending on the country, the city, the location. There are some as I said in the prep remarks, there are some locations that are above 100%. And I won't go into detail -- North Rhine-Westphalia this quarter of Bavaria, Southern France, Southeast of the US this quarter, what we're seeing is as variants come down, those protocols go. We're hitting those \u2013 if you take 2019 as the base year, we're hitting those 100% triple digit rates in some locations. And so gives us a lot of confidence because we\u2019re \u2013 the beauty of, the beauty is we're in all 140 countries. So that portfolio, I feel every 90 days, we\u2019re seeing positive movement. Even though a particular location might go back two steps and one might go forward three steps, on aggregate, we\u2019re seeing sort of one step forward for ResMed as we look across that portfolio every 90 days. That's why we're able to see this great, strong 16% device growth across our region. It's not only share-taking. There's some good flow of patients coming through. What worries me a little bit, John, is actually some of the backlog that might be happening in the system due to our competitor just not being in the market for 18 months, right? In aggregate, according to their call this week, it would be 18 months from June 2021 through to December 2022. That backlog of patients, we can't get them all, right? We're ramping up, as Rob said, doing everything we can to ramp up. We're not going to get them all. And so that backlog of patients, even when our competitor comes back, is going to have to flow through the system. So this is not just an effect that's over the day our competitor is back. There's going to be a number of quarters where ResMed is going to grow, take share, and deal with this flow of patients through there. So although we're pushing very strong around our long-term demand gen, we're not turning up the dials yet on driving the top of the funnel because, frankly, the top of the funnel is full and growing and will do for the next 12 months. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning, all. More of a medium-term question, Mick. So as the industry isn't able to meet the demands of new patients at the moment, what are you doing to ensure that patients don't fall off the waiting list? And I guess do you see any risk here that the industry will see slower growth in the medium term from all the disruption over this 12-, 24-month period? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Gretel. I'll have a first go at it and hand to Jim. I mean, the short answer to your question is absolutely not. I do not see any growth slowing down. In fact, the backlog, certainly for ResMed, I see incredible growth coming for our industry. And a lot of the demand gen stuff I talked about, and we talked about on our Investor Day with CVS partnerships on the brick and mortar side in the front line. And then on our Verily partnership premised, on the front line, we are not turning the dollars on that demand gen up and we don't need to through 2022. But we will start to put on the map in 2023. And I think what we'll see is the backlog will come in \u2013 and our demand gen will come in and we'll actually post-COVID see a faster growth rate of our industry because of all the learnings of digital health, home sleep apnea testing, seamless and digital end to end journeys for patients. It's got better for patients when they get into the system. The trouble is now competitor can't provide the therapy at the end and that does create a bit of a backlog. But I think on the other side of this, we'll actually see increased secular growth. That mid to high single digit growth for our industry might move up 50 basis points, 100 even more basis points because of the embracement of digital net net. But Jim, anything to go to Gretel\u2019s question around industry growth there? Jim Hollingshead : Yeah, Gretel, I guess I would, I would just add a couple of things. The first one is we're working really hard with our channel partners to understand the dynamic of patient wait lists and working really hard with physicians on that. And so, we\u2019re \u2013 as you know we're prioritizing higher acuity patients, higher acuity conditions with our with our production. But we know that there are kind of straight OSA patients out there, they're facing longer waitlists and we're working with our customers to try to reduce those wait times and to better manage an understanding of when we can deliver product to which customers are so. So that's just sort of a general thing we're trying to do. I think the other thing that will help us to drive growth on an ongoing basis is we're working right now on programs that will allow us to capture patients who may be faced a long waitlist. And I don't want to go to great detail on that but our marketing teams in our main countries are working on those programs right now. And as we have more supply, we feel pretty confident we'll be able to run programs that will be able to reengage patients that maybe have, they're tired of waiting or something like that. So we think we'll be able to capture a big, big part of that backlog, which there is a backlog and we think there'll be an even bigger backlog, which I \u2013 if there is a backlog and we think there'll be an even bigger backlog as that goes forward. And the last thing I would add is, we're pretty active in developing new channels. And so, those are those are new and growing areas for us. But if you think about something like CVS Health hubs, there's a new channel that that continues to grow, CVS continues to invest there. That's a new way for patients to be reminded that they were diagnosed with OSA or to be reminded that they might need resupply. And CBS is just one example where we're working in new channels. We're doing that not just in the US, but in multiple markets around the world. So we're going to expand the ability to reach of different channels for patients to get treated. And we'll be \u2013 we're accelerating those now. We'll be accelerating those programs even more as production comes up to higher volumes and we're able to treat more patients. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Good morning and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe one for Rob. Rob, just on the discussion around semiconductors and the shortages, can you talk to us about the line of sight you get as it relates to the inflow of those chips and then the manufacturability? In other words, is it still taking circa three months to process devices? And so, are you in a position now to know what your volume on flow generators is looking like into fourth quarter because you have these chips either sitting with you now or they're due to come in over the next few weeks? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Actually, as I was saying earlier, we've actually had to greatly extend our forecast lead times for it to get the supply commitments that we want, actually multi-year. So at that level, we have a long, long view. The year \u2013 our cycle times are actually pretty short. The longest part of our cycle time and variable part of it is freight. And so, a lot of the challenges of forecasting sales on a weekly basis is what's happening to any freight that's stuck off Los Angeles or something like that. Now, we can mitigate that at a cost with air freight, and we do that, but we certainly can't do a 100% on freight. And so we're trying to balance up those sort of freight demands and that does create a variability. So the hardest thing for predicting what's going to \u2013 what we're forecasting over the next couple of weeks is actually those freight deliveries. Our internal systems around delivering them out of our warehouses are extremely slick and really run well, and we've got great teams in those warehouses. Our factory capacity, we typically run a policy of having significant burst capacity in these factories. And as we've said before, we\u2019ve just invested in a major new factory in Tuas in Singapore. We're \u2013 out of that factory, we would normally have the capacity to meet all of the industry demand. So we can actually push stuff through that system really quickly. The key issue is that variability and the propensity of the suppliers to meet their commitments. Now, they'll do everything they can to meet their commitments. But actually, some of those freight issues, they have the same issues. They have the same issues of allocation from their suppliers. And so we have to manage all the way through all of those layers to get there. So it's a long answer. But really, the main factor is the suppliers and the short-term variability of freight. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Yeah. Good morning, all. I guess you\u2019ve spoken about volume in detail, but can we talk about price and provide some color on the trends you're seeing in average device prices this quarter and perhaps with some reference to mix and discounting, if you can. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks, Lyanne. It's a good question. And traditionally we don't talk much about price at all. But one thing I will say is that we announced it in our prep remarks \u2013 my prep remarks here today that we have a surcharge now on all ResMed devices. There are such as with exactly with the last question from Sol [ph] where Rob was showing that increased air freight and sea freight costs of 5X or 10X what they were, air freight was always a significant factor of above sea freight and it's got more expensive too and so all of that has meant that we had to provide that surcharge to our patients. So we haven't done a price increase as some of our competitors have to the customers but we have put a \u2212 we have put a surcharge on devices starting in January. Our customers have accepted it. I mean, you know, the people running these companies go to a supermarket and see the price of milk or the price of whatever commodities that they're purchasing in their daily lives going up in price. And so a surcharge from us given the nature of this has made sense to them. And so, you know, your question was what's the levels of price discounting? There is no product discounting right now. In fact, we're taking away some of the early pay and some of the other factors that were there that were non price related but the impact is sort of cash flow there because it's very important in an environment like this to make sure that the costs are shared in a fair and equal way through the supply chain and we're doing that through a surcharge. But as I see it, you know, the mix side, the second part of your question. We're following our guiding principle on allocation here. If we have limited chips and parts and pieces, we will make an Astral before [ph] before an echo of STA and ST and ASP and so on down to an APAP and CPAP. And so the mix, you know, can lead to some sort of ASP mix increases on that but any individual like-for-like product we\u2019re keeping the prices where they are because we're in a steady, reimbursed environment, our customers we have relationships going back decades. We want them for decades for the future and we really value those relationships. And so we're really focused on this sort of temporary surcharges is going to be associated with those increased costs we have and any impact on ASP is really around mix towards those higher acuity products. Operator : Thank you. Our question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden Australia. Your line is now live. Steve Wheen : Yeah. Thanks very much. I've got a somewhat related question for Brett just with regards to the gross margin. So I was just wondering if you could help us sort of break into that number a little bit particularly from the point of view of the next few quarters. So I'm trying to put into context the surcharge as to what sort of effect that will have. And then there's obviously other drivers which all look quite positive like FX mix, maybe the [indiscernible] pricing. So if you could sort of maybe comment on any of that. And then lastly, maybe a headwind, is there any pricing pressure coming from the semiconductors suppliers to you guys ? So yeah, if you could help me unpackage that gross margin that would be great. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks. Steve. Now, let me try to unpack that a little bit here. On the gross margin, if you look at it year-on-year-year, pretty big decline and really freight was the big one and logistics costs. Some component cost increases coming in and also manufacturing because they really had to optimize on the manufacturing front. At the moment, we were just trying to make sure we can really maximize output rather than efficiencies. So that's playing out that played out year-on-year-year. If you look at it sequentially, not in quite good shape, a little bit of an increase there sequentially actually. If you go forward, we're still going to have freight and logistics costs coming through. I mean, that's still going to be, I think, a headwind for I think for the rest of this calendar. FX probably relatively neutral as we look forward and I think ASP declines won't \u2013we've typically had that but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see that going forward. We have the surcharge. It\u2019s only a small surcharge. And we're only \u2013 we're not recovering anywhere near our increasing cost there but we're \u2013 as Mick said we're looking to share that. So they're kind of \u2013 they're still with us. There are some headwinds there. We've got AirSense11 coming through, which is at a price premium but that's only in the US market at the moment. But taking the medium term view, that'll be supportive. But the other one to call out is as particularly in Q4, as we increase the output or the volumes from the supply constraints easing and we'll have higher revenue there. But in a relative sense, it'll be more of the kind of lower acuity in terms of that mix. So that one will be a little bit of a headwind, so the product mix won't be as beneficial as it has been. So there\u2019s puts and takes there. But that's how kind of how see it at the moment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is live. David Bailey : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. You sort of touched on this in part of your earlier remarks. But I just wanted to confirm that you're confident that some of the changes in relation to digital initiatives over the past couple of years will allow the system to deal with the backlog of new patients over the medium term. Mick Farrell : Yes, David. It\u2019s a really pertinent question. And I feel very confident. And we've watched it. Before this recall was announced, through to June 2021, we saw great adoption for 18 months of all the digital solutions from doctors getting involved in telehealth to the adoption of identification, engagement, enrollment and diagnostic systems on a digital basis. In countries where, like in Germany, where it would obviously be interesting was less than 10% of the total diagnoses in 2019. It went to huge double digits throughout 2020 10% of the total diagnosis in 2019, it went to huge double digits throughout 2020, and it stayed quite high despite the reopening with COVID-cleaning particles of sleep labs throughout Germany. And so, I think as you look an aggregate, David, that adoption that happened in the last two years will be a huge impact, permanent adoption of digital health screening tools. And as Jim said, as we open up new channels, we're going to roll that digital end-to-end solution through multiple new funnels to get patients into the funnel through the early partnership with Prim [ph] through our CVS partnership. And they're the two public ones in the US, but we're doing, as Jim said, stuff in the other 140 countries that are more a partnership basis partnership basis with the UK government, with the NHS. Some great information from our UK team I was looking at over the last week, incredible work in our Northern Europe team. Our Western European team, the partnership with the French government. I talked about the ALASKA study that's just the peer reviewed, published evidence that's out there. We're doing stuff on the ground that we're not talking about publicly, but it has incredible adoption of digital health technologies in conjunction with the French Social Security system, supporting that through high reimbursement of cloud connected CPaaP versus non-cloud connected CPaaP. Because they see the results, they see high adherence, they see better outcomes, they see lower costs, not only death rate, lower death rate of those we'll see proper but lower hospitalization, so it saves lives and saves money. So, David, it's a permanent adoption. I think it will improve our efficiency as an industry, as we get into 2022, 2023 here and beyond. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live. Margaret Kaczor : Hey. Good afternoon, and good morning to you, sir. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the math that you guys had implied from the benefit of the competitive recall. And if we sort of keep the fiscal Q3 benefits similar to what we saw in fiscal Q2, maybe pick it up a little bit, the fiscal Q4 benefit sounds the fiscal Q4 benefit sounds like it's going to be, $130 million, $140 million or so at the midpoint of your range. So as we think about that with Philips extending the timing of the impact of the recall, should we be using that $140 million as a base benefit as we go into the second half of the calendar year, especially given that it sounds like even at that range, the demand maybe isn't fully satisfied. And so, theoretically go higher especially with the underlying market improvements. Mick Farrell : Yeah, Margaret it's a great question and I'm not going to get into sort of the detailed breakdown of the $350 million through the fiscal year. But as you said, look at it is, back end loaded in terms of Q4 is going to be the lion's share of that, of that because all the projects that Rob talked about earlier will come to fruition in June, September and December. And so the only guidance I think I've given in the last nine years as CEO was around this $350 million on the revenue side there for fiscal 2022. So I'm not going to go into 2023. We did that because the models were quite wide there on the benefit from this recall on the sell side for as low as $50 million to as high as $950 million. So we wanted to right set it at $300 million to $350 million. We're still comfortable with that for fiscal 2022. But as you look for fiscal 2023, look, I do think that the share that we're taking this year will be long term sustainable share. When we go in and take share, we don't just go into a competitive account and say, great, here's your product, good. We work with people who are adopting existing relationships with people who are adopting Maya for their patients, getting that 60%, 70% uptake that we've seen with AirSense 11. They're working with AirView. All their physicians are on the cloud platform, getting that efficiency. They\u2019re using Brightree and they're partnering up in the United States and beyond. So that digital end to end, it becomes a very sticky platform because the value is so strong. They lower their labor costs by 50%, setting up the device, they improve adherence to 87% for their patients and their physicians and it becomes permanent. So I do think that the share we're taking will be long term sustainable. do think that the share we're taking will be long-term sustainable. When our competitor comes back, they're going to have to go after the low-priced people first that don't have all that digitally end to end. When they try to come after us, we're going to be so far ahead with 18 months\u2019 worth of digital health innovation and all the work that we're doing to partner with physicians, patients, and providers. I look forward to it. We were winning this football game before we got the penalty kick. It's like we were the Kansas City Chiefs and we were up 42 to 0, and then we got a penalty kick, and then we're up 45 to 0. It doesn't \u2013 we didn't need the penalty kick to get there, so I still think we'll win on the other side of this. But having said that, we're not going to give guidance around 2023, but everyone will have their models. I think that certainly with that competitor being out for the calendar year, we're going to take incredible share this calendar year. I think as they come back, the nine brand will be different. They'll have to start from the ground up and we'll have a strong lead as we go through fiscal 2023 and beyond. The most important thing, we're not really looking back at our competition. We're looking forward as we're talking about it, Jim and I've been talking about it. It's about the digital health solutions getting patients into the funnel and finding new ways to get the 1 billion people worldwide who have sleep suffocation into the funnel and 80% to 90% of them are undiagnosed. That's what we're laser focused on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon, everyone. Mick, one question from my side. And Mick, let me pose this as a hypothetical. Obviously, demand is not being met, right? Whether because of supply constraints or so forth, how do you ration between an organic ResMed patient that will be sticky long term versus, let's say, a Phillips patient that potentially could generate a higher ESP in short term? I guess, a subpart to that I'm also trying to understand, do you see mix and matches going out to the field, i.e., tubes and accessories with blowers being mixed and match just to meet demand? Thank you. Mick Farrell : Raj, it's a good question. And look, we don't \u2013 and particularly in the United States market, we work with home care providers and we're really taking the human patient first model here first which is we start with the highest acuity patients and work our way down. With our partnerships with home care providers, we start with existing relationships, digital adoption and because it drives best efficiency for the system and best outcomes for patients. So we don't make priorities. I will choose this patient because it will be more profitable this system because it'll be there. We focus on that acuity first, those relationships and the adoption of digital, because the long term is what we're focused on. We don't want some short term revenues and short term gains that you just give up. What you\u2019re looking for transforming the health care system towards our 2025 goal. And so that's where our priorities are. Any further color, Jim, you'd like to provide on Raj\u2019s question? Jim Hollingshead : Yeah. Thanks. Just a couple of things. I mean, first thing I\u2019d said, we're not making the decision about the patients. It's the provider that's making the decision about the patients. But we're driving our production mix for higher acuity so that we can able providers to meet the needs of the higher acuity patients first. That\u2019s the first thing I would say. Second thing, just as a reminder, I think we mentioned this. I think we mentioned it today, but we've certainly talked about this on previous calls. The way we're prioritizing product allocation is higher acuity patients, but we're also prioritizing, effectively prioritizing existing ResMed customer volumes, right? And that's a very explicit decision, right, because we could have said the alternative. We could have said we're going to take this opportunity to go take accounts that have favored Philips historically. But in fact, what we've done is we've done all of our allocations of product based upon the history we have with our customers. And the fact that that means is that its customers who are \u2013 have been more adopted of ResMed products who are getting more volume from us, right? And one of the opportunities for us as our volumes build, it\u2019s actually once we\u2019ve met the demand with those customers they actually take competitive share and in accounts that might have trended more towards Phillips historically. So that\u2019s and we have some questions on growth next year, I think that\u2019s a big opportunity for us for growth next year. And then the third thing on your question is it\u2019s always been the case that providers will mix and match one manufacturer\u2019s mask with one manufacturer\u2019s device or whatever. There's a little bit more of a tie to the device and the tube if it's a heated tube because those are lock and key, you know, are heated to work with our devices and not with others. But we have higher share. We have a higher attach rate for all the consumables in the market than our competitors do. So when there's mixing and matching, it's almost always to our benefit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Polark from Baird. Your line is now live. Michael Polark : Hey. Good day. Thanks for taking the question. It's a US-centric one. And I'm curious, you know, Inspire as second line CPA P therapy in the US. The company has been running a fairly active marketing campaign with TV commercials. In 2021, they spent $50 million. That number is going to be a lot higher in 2022. And I think a regional campaign is going national. Inspire second line. So, you know, it goes without saying on that. But their commercials tend not to portray CPAP therapy in the best light. And I'm curious what you think about this and if there's any counter detailing efforts you can do to respectfully push back on some of the marketing runs that that Inspire is doing? Mick Farrell : Yeah, thanks for your question, Michael. And it speaks to substitute therapies, which is something we look at very carefully because ResMed stands for respiratory medicine not CPAP manufacturer, right. And so we've been in alternative therapies for the sleep apnea therapy for decades. We have a dental 3-D printed dental device called Narval we\u2019re the number one provider of dental sleep apnea therapy in Western Europe, Northern Europe and many other countries around the world. And we've invested in the technology in this space of the company you mentioned, Inspire. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is the category. We invested in a company called Nyxoah, N-Y-X-O-A-H, which is actually now listed on Nasdaq and on a European exchange, and they're in PMA trials here in the United States and an MDR work in Europe. And so that product will come to market in this segment. Look, yeah, we've seen some people do DTC advertising in this space. There was an oxygen delivery company that had a guy from Star Trek for a while. I think these things of demand gen in the old-school way is not the future for us. We're focused on social media. Our partnership with Google and Verily is around people typing in, my husband snores, I snore, and getting through a digital end-to-end pathway to identify, engage, and enroll people through. And we haven't really gone old-school media with demand gen, and we certainly don't need it in calendar 2022. To your point, you can't change \u2013 you can market however you want the industry, but you can't change clinical and economic realities. CPAP is the most economical and best noninvasive way to treat sleep apnea, period. Now, we make a sleep apnea device and a dental device, and we\u2019re invested in hypoglossal nerve stim. I say that on the clinical and economic reality. Talk to any pulmonary person. Even an ENT surgeon will say, no, you have to try CPAP. You have to try dental, and then you'll try the hypoglossal nerve stim. ResMed is going to be involved in all three categories. I think they'll all be valid. But I think they should be known. He\u2019s primary, he\u2019s secondary, and he\u2019s tertiary. And the economic reality is clear. You can Google the price. It's probably gone up a little on sleepapnea.com for a CPAP from those providers or EasyBreathe.com. They're probably $500 for the device, and trailing is, what, $100 on a mask every year. Compare that to a $25,000 surgery. I don't care what your high deductible health plan and health savings account is in the US. That's a lot of money for the individual and a boatload for the health system. So there'll be some economic realities of payers doing care management around this as it grows. Good category, long term. My opinion on the \u2013 that is any talk including the Wall Street Journal article this morning around 1 billion suffocating, 80%, 90% obviously that beyond diagnosed, any news about sleep apnea, sleep suffocation is good for ResMed and its demand gen. I preferred in 2023 than 2022 because we\u2019ve got enough demand to keep us going for 12 months. We\u2019ll be turning the knobs on our social media, our digital and our brick-and-mortar demand gen in 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Mike Matson : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for fitting me in. Just want to ask about the surcharge. I don't know if you're willing to disclose, you know, roughly what percentage that is. And is that something that's being applied to all of your products, in other words, the devices and mask and accessories or just specific to devices? And then, finally, is this something that's, you know, intended to be temporary or something that, you know, you expect to be more permanent? And I have a follow-up as well on something else. Mick Farrell : Yeah, Mike. Thanks. And we may not have time for your follow-up given we\u2019re 15 minutes over already. But, look, the surcharge, uncomfortable, I think there was a sell-side note that was public at around this. We \u2013 it's a $12 surcharge in the US and a \u20ac12 surcharge in Europe. And it's basically on all devices. It's not applying on the mask side. So that's the answer to those. To the question of how long will this last, obviously, we're in discussions with customers around the world. If you look at Rob's answer to the question or if you're reading the transcript, further up that transcript, it's a complex issue around sea freight, air freight, component costs, semiconductor, microchips, and we don't know how long those freight costs will be high. Those component costs will be high. So I will say the surcharge will be there as long as those are there. It's temporary, but it's as long as those are there. And you know, I think you've got many other stocks in your portfolio where they're talking, they are the semiconductor manufacturer or the others who give you further detail on how long they think they will have supply chain constraints and therefore higher costs to pass-through their customers. So that's \u2013 that'd be the way I'd answer your two questions, Mike. Thank you for bringing those through and thank you to everyone for staying an extra 15 minutes. There's a lot to go on this quarter. Look, thanks to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call. I\u2019d once again, I'd like to take the opportunity for the 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders who listen in here for your dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better, live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. Thanks for surviving this COVIDness and the Zoom calls, and all the craziness. Thanks also to our frontline heroes who aren't on Zoom calls. They're doing patient care, technical care sales teams, visiting customers every day. I'd also like a special call out to the frontline supply chain team, management, procurement, distribution and our digital health teams working around the clock to keep up with every new launch of myAir, AirView, and Brightree, and MatrixCare. So thank you all. I look forward to talking to you all again in 90 days. Thank you. I'll hand you to Amy to close us out. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick. And to echo Mick's comments, thank you everyone for sticking with us extra 15 minutes. That enabled us to get through everybody in the call to queue. We do appreciate your interest in your time, and if you have any follow-up questions or additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. This does conclude our second quarter 2022 call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may just connect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you Kevin. Hi everyone and welcome to ResMed\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of our earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. With me on the call today are ResMed\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, President-Sleep and Respiratory Care; and David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that are made today. I'd like to now turn the conference call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended March 31. Our third quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with double-digit revenue growth in our sleep and respiratory care business, and high single digit growth in our software as a service segment. Our growth is the direct result of our global team's ability to pivot and drive for results, even as we continue to manage through several external challenges that are impacting our business, including one, on-going supply chain disruptions; two, COVID restrictions in parts of the world, three, recovering post-COVID Peak patient flow, and four unprecedented demand from a competitor recall, which will keep them out of the market at least through the end of the calendar year. The global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries. I'm very proud of our team growing double-digits this quarter year-on-year with an astounding 30% growth this quarter for devices in U.S. Canada, and Latin America. Even with this incredible growth, the demand in the market was even greater. As with almost all customers in the global components industry, we remain on allocation from our suppliers, particularly for electronic components, with our number one bottleneck being semiconductor chips. This allocation impacts our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in our marketplace. And we are forced intern to allocate ResMed products to our customers. We have established guiding principles for allocation, giving priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. Additionally, the on-going challenges of sea freights and air freight due to reduced availability and increased prices are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into and finished goods out of our factories worldwide. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners doing everything that we can to secure additional supply to further increase production of our devices. This work includes a combination of a number of workstreams. One, shoring up the flow of existing parts from existing suppliers, two establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers, three validating new parts from existing suppliers, and four validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers as we review and redesign across key devices in our portfolio. In addition, we have fifth line of work. So it's five lines of work and that fifth line is reengineering designs to eliminate and or mitigate the top bottlenecks to achieve greater flow through our supply chain. The most significant example of a project in this fifth line of work is our newly released AirSense 10 Card-to-cloud device. This device eliminates the number one bottleneck of the 3G, 4G comms chip, while facilitating secure data upload to our cloud based software platform called AirView so that providers and physicians can access the data and better manage the patient. We've already begun to offer AirSense 10 Card-to-cloud devices in select markets to some customers, and we will be ramping up from there. With these five lines of work continuing in parallel, we have been able to offset some of the impact of continuing component shortages and de-commits to help us better support patients, providers and physicians. We recognize that this is a very difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians who feel the pressure from their patients, home medical equipment providers who see this every day in their businesses, but also payers and entire healthcare systems and especially the most important customer, the patient themselves. We are partnering across the industry to be the solutions provider to these problems. We expect a significant backlog of patients diagnosed and coming through the system to be present for at least the next 12 to 18 months with incredible associated demand. We are working to address this demand with these portfolios of supply projects and beyond, and we will get through this time stronger than ever as an industry and as a company. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and other key chronic respiratory insufficiency diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out of the hospital care software as a service solutions. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly discuss the other broad market conditions in our industry. We continue to see steady on-going recovery of patient flow and demand through the diagnostic channel across the countries that we operate in. In fact, many countries are above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. However on-going surges, variance, and government restrictions continue to impact a few countries which will remain below pre-COVID diagnostic levels. China is a case in point right now with severe shutdowns in Shanghai and beyond. But across our portfolio, our global portfolio, we're in 140 countries that we serve, I expect that these metrics will steadily improve to pre-COVID patient levels and beyond. As vaccines and boosters roll out globally, and people remain focused on their personal respiratory health and hygiene that's been a big learning through COVID. With the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis, and remote patient setup, and remote patient monitoring, as well as established COVID cleaning protocols, sleep labs and other facilities, I expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each and every time. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. Number one, which is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma businesses. Number two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital where people live, and especially in the home. The U.S. launch of our next generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Although it is challenging to differentiate on-going positive customer sentiment and feedback from the incredibly high demand in the U.S. market and beyond. The AirSense 11 has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all time high demand for ResMed devices, and it couldn't have launched at a better time for that purpose to help us mitigate on-going component shortages. We will introduce the AirSense 11 into additional countries in the fourth quarter that we're in right now here at fiscal year 2022 and throughout fiscal 2023. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market leading platform the AirSense 10, which is second in customer preference only to the AirSense 11 including the new Card-to-cloud AirSense 10 as we seek to maximize the total volume of CPAP APAP and bi-levels [ph] available for all of our customers. With our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy in a digitally native environment like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our home medical equipment and homecare provider customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients. AirView for physicians and providers, and Brightree for HME providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs, and together with us we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. With the latest technology built into the AirSense 11 platform, we are driving higher adoption rates of the myAir app by patients higher than ever before. Right now, we are seeing more than double the myAir adoption rate as patients engage directly in their own health care. People want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they liked the coaching and the personal engagement of our digital ecosystem. This means more patients are signing up onto myAir every day and fully engaging with ResMed\u2019s software technology, helping us to now pass over 11.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud. Ultimately these software solutions, these big data deliver a better patient experience. They deliver better efficiencies for homecare providers, and most importantly, they deliver greater long term adherence to therapy by patients. Let me spend just a couple of minutes outlining some real world evidence showing that greater therapy adherence leads to lower hospitalizations, lower mortality, and better clinical outcomes through mitigation of chronic disease. We are demonstrating better patient outcomes and lowering costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry. These are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy. The latest example is a study recently published in the landmark American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Journal, also known in the industry as the Blue Journal. This article demonstrates that patients with obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were adherent to CPAP therapy versus non-adherence to CPAP therapy, and it showed significant year one and year two reduction of clinical use by over 30% and reduction of inpatient hospitalizations by nearly 50%. It showed a 20% reduction in year one and year two total healthcare resource cost, which included a 25% reduction in emergency room costs and a 52% reduction in inpatient hospitalizations. These are important metrics for the whole healthcare system. Another key aspect of our long term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnostic funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and respiratory health, including telehealth tools, and specifically home-based sleep apnea tests. Although driving demand generation is not a priority in the immediate term, given the supply shortage and incredible demand we're facing, we are maintaining our long term focus and investments in this diagnostic channel so that we are ready when conditions improve to ensure sustainable, long term pipelines of new patients coming through the channel. With 1.6 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma. It's also our duty to do this. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create even more efficient and effective approaches to sleep apnea, patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment, and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enable what we call an end-to-end seamless digital experience for patients. One example we recently rolled out is the next generation of our remote mask selector tool that makes mask selection and sizing easier and more effective by creating personalized mask recommendations based on a patient's health, sleep attributes and their own facial measurements. Choosing the right mask is challenging to do remotely. But getting the right mask fit is crucial to patient comfort and long term adherence. The technology MaskSelector is a web based tool that solves this problem by prompting the patient to answer a few simple questions and follow a few easy steps with their camera enabled smartphone to capture a digital facial scan. Based on the answers and the digital facial measurements, MaskSelector then provides a recommended mask and sizing. Whether a patient is then being set up at home remotely, or preparing for a face-to-face interaction with a respiratory therapist and clinical staff at a provider's office MaskSelector helps the patient quickly get to the right mask for their unique needs. Turning to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with COPD worldwide, and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach many hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as our cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology, and the high flow therapy offerings, such as our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency patients remain strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the U.S. where providers shifted focus to supporting the most severe and highest acuity patients. This demand and the work of providers is aligned with the ResMed guiding principles of our allocation process, specifically to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation. As I speak, we are not component constrained on our life support ventilator called Astral. Let me now review our software as a service business for out of hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business achieved high single digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets, including home medical equipment, as well as facilities based and home based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software services and solutions help them achieve both. The continued growth of home based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products. And we continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including our landmark Brightree and SNAP ReSupply products. As businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers in person, as well as to attend SaaS trade shows where interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare and Citus offerings to name a few remain very strong. We have a very solid pipeline in SaaS. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, where headwinds have kept patients census rates below pre-pandemic levels. But as COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent up demand for technology investments, which provide opportunities for us to sell more services and more solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. As we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue growth to maintain high single digit growth as we exit this fiscal year, and well into the next fiscal year and beyond. As always, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate, and we expect to grow the market and take market share. We are the leading, strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care. And we provide mission critical software across a broad range of very attractive vertical markets. We are well positioned and we have created differentiated value for customers and for ResMed with our SaaS businesses. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMeds future growth and I see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower cost, lower acuity settings of care. It's the future of healthcare delivery with strong organic and inorganic growth in ahead for ResMed. Our focus is on personal care that is patient centric, physician centric and provider centric. This approach combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and beyond. We are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. As I said earlier, we have over 11.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. And we have over 17 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de identified data to help patients directly, but also to help providers, physicians, payers, and entire healthcare systems. We have invested in the cyber security, the privacy, cloud operations, as well as data analytics, including artificial intelligence machine learning capabilities to do this at a scale unmatched by our competitors. And we are increasing our lead each and every day. Our two key software, customer facing products, AirView and myAir are now 100% managed in the cloud. So not only are our devices cloud connected and our software cloud enabled, we here at ResMed as a company, are cloud connected and cloud enabled. Infact, we are a leading digital health company globally. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates me and ResMedians around the world every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal during the last quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks. I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8000 ResMedians worldwide for their perseverance their hard work and their dedication during these on-going and unprecedented times. Thank you for all that you do. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett and Sydney [ph] and then we will move to open the lines for Q&A. Over to you, Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great, thanks Mick. I'll provide an overview of our results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We had solid financial performance in Q3 despite the headwinds we faced as a result and significant on-going supply chain constraints and a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the March quarter was $865 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care products across our portfolio driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the on-going product recall by one of our competitors. In the March quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19 related demand. In relation to the impact of our competitors recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $35 million to $45 million in the March quarter. For the first three quarters of FY 22, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $170 million to $190 million. We continue to experience challenges in securing sufficient components and this has hampered our ability to materially increase our supply of devices. We expect our fiscal fourth quarter to remain supply constraints and similar to our recent fiscal quarters, therefore limiting incremental revenue during the fourth quarter. We now expect a total incremental device revenue opportunity for fiscal year 2022 will fall somewhere between $200 million and $250 million. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Of that segment, globally in constant current terms, device sales increased by 21%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 30%, as we've benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the high acuity patients first. Masks and other sales in the U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient\u2019s setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 13% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter. We saw strong performance out of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 150 basis points to 58.1% in the March quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs, partially offset by a positive product mix, due to strong growth in our higher acuity devices and improvement in average selling prices following the introduction of the device surcharge. Moving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable and negative price rates we experienced in Q3 last year. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 17%. The increase was probably attributed to an increase in employee related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue at 21% remained broadly consistent with the 20.9% we reported in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of FY 22. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 19% or in constant currency terms increased by 22%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to 7.3% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product, and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the second half of FY 2022. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin and higher operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 21.1%, compared to the prior year quarter non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rates for the full fiscal year 22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 2% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 2%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $117 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $48 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter we pay dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.6 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the premise on a joint venture with Verily, We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million to $3 million per quarter, the balance of fiscal year 22 and into FY 23 associated with a joint venture operation. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $202 million. At March 31, we had $681 million in gross debt, and $479 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at March 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to ask you to come back on the line. I'll turn the call over to you to provide instructions and to manage the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. David Low : Thanks very much. If I could just start with a question on the guidance from the benefit from the field free call. So it's fallen $100 million short of where you are projecting a year or so ago. Just wondering how you are now thinking about that opportunity set as we move into the new financial year? Mick Farrell : Hey, David, yes, it's Mick here. That's a good question. And, clearly as we in the second half of the year now we're readjusting that expectation for FY 22 now in total to be 200 to 250. You look I'll just be very open, very specifically a contract from 12 months ago with a particular I will not name them. But a particular semiconductor supplier had a very significant double-digit de-commit in these last months, weeks, and there's a commitment from 12 months ago, that had some very strong supply and it went down double-digits. And so with that as a headwind into us all the tail winds of our work, the five projects, five lines of projects going on in our supply chain allowed us to sort of, take two steps forward and two steps back versus two steps forward and one step back. And that didn't allow us to achieve that that extra 100 million of incremental revenue that we thought that we would achieve here through fiscal 22 for the first half. And so that's going to be tougher and as things a little bit further back. Having said that some of these projects coming to market such as the Card-to-cloud AirSense 10 device, where we eliminate that bottleneck or the number one bottleneck, which is the 3G, 4G comms chip. And we allow, the next bottleneck, which is another electronic components to become the one, we can then speed up some production to make up some of that difference. And that's allowed us to achieve the 30% year-on-year growth that we saw in devices in U.S., Canada, and Latin America and the 10% year-on-year growth that we achieved this quarter for Europe, Asia and rest of the world. Look, it's not perfect sailing ahead. When you get de-commits. I'd never heard that word de-commit. We're offering you got a signed contract, you're offering money, very good margins, long term contracts, and people just can't supply. Often force majeure and other aspects coming into play. But I can tell you that all the work that we've been doing these hard works by supply chain have allowed us to actually to achieve these results despite that headwind. We're not planning on giving guidance for FY 23 around this. We are saying that this is what I'll say. What we're doing is going to strive for sequential growth every quarter as we go ahead. So sequential growth from March to June, June to September, September to December throughout this fiscal year. That's what we're going for. And I actually think as you start to look towards the second half of the calendar year, you look at the December quarter, there are a number of other projects that don't involve necessarily the risk of an externality of other de-commit from someone else's enough projects. And enough, I would say, new suppliers, new components, new designs and new engineering reengineering that we're doing around both the hardware and the software to give us a strong confidence in supply of product ahead. So I think that supply chain have done amazingly. And, if you look at what we would have achieved, 14% growth, constant currency year-on-year, yes, we could have, we could have got to 20% or 25%, if we'd had unlimited supply, de-commits, and changes in supply chain in global semiconductor and other electronic components have been a headwind. But I think with all the work we've got, we're going to power through this, we got a strong ship, there are waves ahead, but we're going to power through it stronger than ever. And I think our team has done a great job in the supply that we're going to get throughout this calendar year will be a great opportunity for sequential growth as we go through. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning, Mick. Just one question on the backlog of patients. So you did mention in your prepared remarks, just trying to see if you can quantify how large the backlog is currently? And how long are patients waiting to get on to treatment? Is there something that ResMed can do to keep these patients engaged? Or is there a risk that they potentially fall out of the system? If they don't get onto product, in a in a short period of time? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Gretel. It's a great question. And yes, as you know that I talked about at least 12 to 18 months of a backlog, which is, in many industries you say fantastic to have a backlog, but these are patients waiting therapy and to the specific party a question Gretel, how long will any individual patient wait? It's not like a patient gets a diagnosis, and they have to wait 12 to 18 months. It depends on the geography and the environment. It might be eight days or eight weeks, depending on the geography and our flow of products. But an individual patient is not sitting out there told, Oh, you've got this life threatening disease, we'll take care of you next April. They're being told look, it's going to take for four weeks. And they're not happy with that. I mean, they've been told they suffocate maybe 100 times per night, maybe 50 times per hour, if they've got very severe sleep apnea. And they're suffocating. They want therapy, and so that that pressure is there, and the desire is there. We're watching very carefully. I mean, obviously we're involved in the substitute therapies. We sell a dental divides all across western and northern Europe with a number one provider, with novel our technology. We're not seeing this huge movement over to dental and the 100 muscle nerve stem that we're investing through in Astella [Ph]. We're not seeing a huge movement over to those substitutes. So they're being told by the doctor, it's eight days or it's eight weeks, and they're accepting that and they're sitting there in that pipeline. What I mean by the 12 to 18 month backlog is if you look at the net of the industry, this is building up because the number two player here is out. As they said earlier this week, they said at least through the end of this calendar year. I think they said that only be 90% done with their [Indiscernible] by the end of this calendar year. So that means the rest of us have to step up and ResMed is the number one player and we're stepping up the most and we're stepping up incredibly well. And I think we'll do that through it. But even when they come back online, it's not like the backlog goes away the day they come on. That's there and it's for all of us to drive. I think the share that we've gained is going to be entrenched because of the digital solutions we have and we'll go and gain from there. But the patients are there and I think it's awful that somebody might have to wait four weeks, or eight weeks. I don't want them to wait more than 4 hours to 8 hours. But right in the moment we're in this situation will be that way for a period of time given these unprecedented circumstances. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : And good morning all. Thank you for taking my question. Can we just talk a little bit about the device and mass dynamics in both Americas and rest of the world? Obviously, Americans had softer devices, but sorry, had Americans had stronger device growth, but much softer mass growth there. Can you I guess, share what your thoughts are around to the extent that's driven by fewer devices in the market as opposed to resupply, and then vice versa for the rest of the world. Mick Farrell : Thanks Lyanne for the question. Yes, as you mentioned, very strong device growth in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, 30%. And very solid growth in devices in Europe, Asia, elsewhere at 10% netting out at 21% cc across that sector. In the math side actually, if you go back to 2019, Lyanne when we were talking about market growth, right, we were talking then about devices, mid-single digits and masks being high single digits, I look at our global mask growth rate at 9% constant currency with the headwind of new diagnoses downward or competitive being out for new patient stops. And the U.S. Canada, Latin America at 7% constant currency as pretty reasonable growth, new patients are down but what we're actually doing there is working with resupply with Brightree resupply, with SNAP technology ReSupply in the U.S. and around the world with some of our models are working with patients directly in markets like Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and our western and northern European teams working with hospitals and care delivery systems to achieve that 13% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and America. And I think, I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead the President of our global sleep business, but Jim, I think we're actually taking share in some of those categories again in the quarter. Jim Hollingshead : So thanks, Mick. And thanks, Lyanne it\u2019s a great question. I think this is one of those weird circumstances for us where the numbers don't actually very clearly convey the underlying dynamics. And the reason for that is the volumes and the revenue growth we're producing in different markets is almost completely contingent on which SKUs we can produce, right. So it's a little bit, it's a little bit complicated. But we can, when we can produce devices that have sell chips that can go into certain European markets, and we have those components, then we get more growth for that period of time as we ship those products. And then sometimes those specific SKUs get constrained. And so the dynamic is actually pretty constant across all geographies, which is very, very high demand for our devices. Very, very high demand for our masks. There is a headwind on masks, because new patient starts are down because the market is under supplied. But really across all geographies there are tailwinds for masks because in the U.S., we have very resilient resupply and in other European markets, we have very really resilient resupply in markets like France and Northern Europe. And so the number the differences you've seen in the groceries is actually driven by component supply and not by demand dynamics, if that makes sense. So it continues to be really almost unlimited demand for our products across the board. With devices obviously, in the U.S., we introduced AirSense 11. That freed up a lot of capacity for us. That's why we got such outsized growth relative to the other markets in the U.S. market this quarter. And the mask growth is pretty steady across all the markets. Operator : Thank you. The next question today is from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Good morning, Mick. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on the guidance you've provided for the full year for the Philips share gains and that revenue contribution. The other companies obviously, what do you think is the underlying growth rate of the base business excluding that share gains? I guess, in other words, what were you expecting to grow the business by? How do you come up with that 200 to 250 million? And I guess, the question really is what do you expect of the base business to be able to grow up considering the supply constraints that are in the market at the moment? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes, Saul thanks, thanks for the question. And in looking at these estimates started about six months ago. I'll probably get Brett to give a little bit of detail around how we actually came up with the details of the calculations of the 300 to 350 and the 200 and 250. I'll give you the CEOs perspective first, and the CFO will come in and give more quantitative detail in a moment. But the way I looked at it, about six, eight months ago, it was I guess it was June, mid June when the competitor announced this. There were estimates on the sell side from 50 million of incremental revenue for ResMed during the fiscal year, up to 950 million from some of the sell side analysts and we thought that that range is just too broad. We generally don't get guidance we leave that to the job of the very smart people on the sell side and the buy side to do so. But that that variance was too big. And so we said, let's calculate it, let's take our forecast that we had at that time, eight, nine months ago for the fiscal year 22. And then look at what we think we can achieve based upon parts and components we can get into our factories and product we can make to take care of what is a seemingly infinite demand. So we'll just be rate limited on the parts and pieces. And we looked at mostly comms chips and some other electronic components would be rate limiting. And so we said, Okay, let's see how high we can ramp those with our great work from our ops team looking at ResMed 2030, 2035 and a brand new plant in Singapore, we actually weren't limited and aren't limited on manufacturing capacity, it was just about supply. And we estimated 300 million to 350 million in incremental revenue above our forecast growth. We didn't actually give a public number of what our forecast growth was. We just talked about that incremental revenue being there, letting sell side models for their forecast, add on to that in the 300 to 350. We've adjusted that to 200 to 250. So on top of whatever that growth was, we think it'll be 200 to 250. And that's really getting down to these. This last quarter Q4 gives a bit more detail on that. Brett, any further quantitative info, you want to give on that to Saul\u2019s question there? Brett Sandercock : Yes, thanks, Mick. I think we got that right. We saw really what we did is we looked at our pre-recorded forecasts, and it's very much an estimate on what we think that incremental demand was. And to your question kind of what would the underlying growth be? I mean, if you backed out that incremental revenue you'd get, you'd probably get Circa 10% growth on devices. So pretty, pretty strong. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST. Your line is now live. Dan Hurren : I just wanted to ask in regards to you mentioned the Astral, the Astral was not an allocation is unlimited or sorry, is not constrained. And you just talked about how that part is traveling and competitive and the competitive market with Philips being in our market and their products. Mick Farrell : Yes Dan, thanks for the question. And yes, you're right. As I said in the prep remarks, we -- was our guiding principle that we take care of the sickest patients first and the highest security devices first. And the Astral is that and so we've done a great job. Our ops team supply chain team manufacturing team has done a great job. We are not supply constrained on that. And we are going head-to-head with the trilogy and Eva. And what I see, as regular leases of recalls and issues with our competitor in that space. And so not just our brand reputation and the amazing technology that's in the Astral, it's incredibly reliable and very high quality. And I believe we've been taking share there for a number of quarters. But Jim, you want to give detail on the Astral and how well that's doing U.S. and rest of the world? Jim Hollingshead : Yes, thanks, Mick. Thanks, Dan. The Astral\u2019s performing really, really well from a competitive point of view. We've taken share with the Astral it\u2019s very very strong device offering. We've made a number of improvements to that platform over the last couple of years. And also remember that the Astral can be connected to an attachable modem, which can then allow patients using an Astral to be monitored in the cloud. And we have we have that capability now in our AirView platform worldwide. And so we've had a lot of a lot of adoption of monitoring ventilated patients in our AirView platform, especially a very strong growth in Europe with that offering. So Astral continues to perform extremely well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. Matthew Mishan : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just going back to the de-commit. Did you get a sense of why your orders were from over a year ago? We're de-committed and just how do you how did the semiconductor supply chain you know get unlocked over like the next three to six months? Like what are they telling you needs to happen incrementally so that you can get a steady or supply moving forward? Mick Farrell : That's a great, great, great question. I'll talk a little bit about what our supply chain is doing. I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, our CFO to go through the incredible work that Andrew Price and Linda Laidlaw our President of Global ops and the head of our supply chain are doing there. I can tell you what they're getting me to do. They're getting me to work with the CEOs of these of these companies and their heads of production. And you know, we're working and providing information to show the importance and how these technologies that they're providing and going into lifesaving medical devices. I actually created a video for the investors and the internal employees at one of our major electronic components suppliers to talk to them about how every chip they give us gives the gift of breath to a person who's suffocating and to really get that message through, I mean, I think you know in the huge demand for electric cars and, and cloud connected to consumer devices and an across the board demand is up across industries. And so it can be hard if you're a component maker to differentiate, industry A from B from C and and know where it's going. When they know firstly that we pay high margins that we have long term contracts that we\u2019re recession resistant industries we showed through the global financial crisis. And the benefit for employees looking for purpose that, hey, this chip doesn't just go into a car that goes from A to B, or, or give cloud connectivity to a refrigerator. This thing literally keeps someone breathing and allows them and their doctor to see that breath and then improvement of incomes, reduction of costs and reduction in mortality. So getting that message through is really strong. We've been working very strongly since the starting gun sort of went off on this June last year, and we're getting better and better. But across the industry, Rob it's a tough environment for supply. Rob Douglas : Yes, it is tough, Matt. And the way the electronics and semiconductor industry works is like any other industries, a number of players have gotten long term forecasts, which they need to have because the capital investments in order to build capacity takes a long time to develop. But I've really only got short term clarity on what the demand levels are going to be. And the actually the electronic industry has always been feast or famine for particular components. Like that this is just a worse than usual version of the usual situation. There was so much excess demand around the COVID environment. So many new dynamics, like as Mick mentioned, electric vehicles, taking up demand and consumer electronics and all that. And then the, the key suppliers have all their own inputs that have those sort of same investment issues coming. So they're also an allocation for their raw materials, as well. And then they have a number of contracts. And as Mick gets to it as if we can manage the priorities that these people have. And by the way, whenever we talked to almost anyone in any industry, we end up talking to somebody who either has sleep apnea, or their loved ones have sleep apnea, or their good friends have sleep apnea, so we can get a really strong message through as to why it should be a priority. But sometimes they've got contracts, and they need to be able to call force majeure on those contracts before they can supply us. So it's a very complex, complex project, we keep working on it. As Mick mentioned, we've got these other longer term projects that are really designing around the constraints and putting in options so that we can have what would traditionally single source components, we'd have options to multiple source components. We have many different communication modules that can operate in the, into the units now and different protocols. And we'll keep working on that. But it's not going to clear short term. And now we're going to need this great sort of agile performance from our supply team to really try and predict the areas of de-commit so that we can inform our engineering teams of what they should be designing around and get started on those key areas before they become problems. But these are tough problems to solve but we're working on it. Mick Farrell : Yes. And in short, our goal will be with all that work that Rob just talked about to make sure we take three steps forward, so that when you do get the two steps back of this and that component, we're still moving forward sequentially every quarter throughout the year, and then really freeing up as Rob said, the long term stuff starts to come into fruition over the next 3, 6, 9 months and beyond. Thanks for the question, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live. David Bailey : Thanks very much. Good morning, Mick I might just follow up on those numbers, five areas of work. You mentioned sourcing validation and reengineering. Just wondering where progress sits relative to your plans? If there have been any benefit to date? And when do you think, these projects are expected to complete such that you do start to see the most benefits coming through? Mick Farrell : David, it's a great, great question. And it's and it's really complex. And I'll probably hand to Rob to maybe give some of the detail on it. But those five lines of work have multiple projects within each of them. I tried to term like, new parts from new suppliers. That means our R&D team is reengineering, a new part validating, verifying, putting through all the quality tests, we're seeing in our market, how incredibly important that is, and we will not compromise on quality. And then you've got to validate and verify a new supplier and get them through. And so just one of those five lines of work is an incredible amount of work for our quality, regulatory, R&D, engineering, production and manufacturing teams. And so these aren't overnight. It's not like we're just having a cell phone here or a comms chip in a consumer device. This thing a life support then has to be working all day every day. A CPAP has to work every night and we are I think able to with all that work I mean as you saw, we got 200 million, 250 million this just this fiscal year ahead of incredible growth and our supply chain pivoted to all of that. If there hadn't been this competitive recall, we as an industry ResMed would have been absolutely able to do with every single supply chain constraint that had happened throughout this. And that's just speaks to the flex and the ability to go. We have these projects that have been going nine months, I actually think they're doing well. It's hard to say, even if I gave you on each of those five lines of work, the key milestones on it, there are probably five projects within each of those. So its sort of a 5 by 5, 25 point matrix. Rob's looking at this, Jim's looking at this on a daily basis. I get the updates every second or third day. As a CEO, I used to focus all my time just on customers talking to customers talking to health insurers and showing the benefit of our therapy, spending a lot more time with supply chain than I want to but right now, that's where the urgent need is. And for the next, 3, 6, 9, 12 months is where we're going to be focused. But at the same time, we're investing in demand gen. So that as the price starts to come back, and it will, and as a competitor comes back along, we can turn that demand gen back on securing all the share gains we've got through the digital entrenchment, and then drive for future growth. But Rob, how do you summarize all the other work we're doing for David succinctly here? Rob Douglas : Yes, we David, we wouldn't break down all the individual projects. But no, I mentioned having multiple columns, protocols, multiple chips, multiple sources of chips. And to mix point, our issue around quality and patient safety is just so important. So we can't really take any undue risk or give any give on the quality of the validation processes. And making sure we're doing the right thing through all of that. So you can't just throw in a new component and say, let's see if it works. We've got to really do all the proper life testing and check through. So that's why it doesn't happen overnight. But the teams are working on it. And they said they're thinking about how to forecast the right areas, so that we can get on the front foot on these. Another important area is our ability to burst demand and burst supply, when we do get solutions come in, and you actually will see our inventory levels have increased. And that's interesting in a time, when really every product we make immediately delivered to customers and sold. And that's because we're working hard on making sure we've got all the raw material inventories, including longer term commitment with the suppliers, which actually we've had to do in order to guarantee short term supply. And so we've got very strong inventories of nearly everything, but a few that are short, but when those few ones shorts that were short come in, rather put them quickly into production and quickly get them on to patients. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Mike Matson : Yes, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about this character cloud device, sorry, Card-to-cloud device. Can you maybe comment on how that works? I assume that the collected data on the card and then has to be uploaded somehow. But and then, is there any kind of long term repercussions from having these out there in your installed base in terms of lost data over time or anything like that? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Mike. And I'll hand to Jim to walk through some further detail on it. I can tell you look from ResMed, when we really first got into digital health in 2002, we had paging devices on experimental parts of our devices and 2005, we started to with the AirSense launch in 2006, 2007 I had some SD cards that were in those devices. And so we've sort of had this, this world of card-to-cloud at ResMed for well over a decade, 10 years, 15 years that we've had had the ability to do that type of technology. Obviously, with the AirSense 10, we changed the whole market. We did the sort of reverse Amazon play where we said 100% connectivity in the AirSense 10 through the comms chip. And then you take it seamlessly. And it's and it's taken to go there. Look, this is humanitarian emergency right now. We have a competitor out of the market, and there's not enough comms chips to go around the world. And we looked at this and said, well, look, why don't we go to where we were before, which is a great technology of Card-to-cloud. The differentiator for us is AirView that the doctors use, myAir that the patients use and the whole ecosystem of data. And so I think it's far more efficient and appropriate, then it goes straight in a secure end to end encrypted from the device there. But in this time of emergency for a period of time, who longs knows how long it will last, these AirSense 10 Card-to- clouds, a whole lot better patient getting that technology than one of the competitors out there that has some -- solution that may or may not be encrypted, who knows how it works, and the device not might not be as reliable. So the AirSense 10 is the second best device on the market, second only to the AirSense 11. So Card-to-cloud is out there. But Jim, you know, it's early days. How's it going? Jim Hollingshead : It's very early days and we'll be bringing and we'll be bringing it to more and more geographies but you know to midpoint, we really just want to make sure patients get on therapy. I mean, that's, that's the driving rationale for launching. And this device is Card-to-cloud version residents. And it's basically in AirSense 10 without the cell chip. And so to, the process question Mike you asked is about, the devices all have SD cards in them. The SD card has to get to the provider. The provider uploads the data into the cloud. We've actually just re-launched or launched a renewed and better version of the process for doing that for the software that allows the upload into the cloud. And the great advantage of the whole system is that the patients still can be managed in AirView. And AirView is the best, patient management system on the market, we know that it has the strongest preference, the strongest performance, it's secure. It's encrypted and protects privacy, and, importantly, all have our customers using AirView right now in their workflows. And so that what the, the Card-to-cloud device is missing one step, which is the daily cloud uploaded data and via the system, the data will come into the system into the cloud, when the SD card gets uploaded by the provider. So and that I don't think anybody will do that on a daily basis, they'll do it relatively infrequently. The data is all there in the SD card. The device stores the data for months, so no data is lost. It's just the frequency of upload. And again, the main rationale behind it is we want to make sure patients get on therapy, there's a growing patient backlog, we can produce these devices at volume. And it gets around our biggest constraint, which is the communication. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Maggie on for Margaret. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask the incremental benefit guidance question a little bit of a different way. So obviously, supply constraints here are not allowing you to service all the patients out there. So you're reducing it by 100 million. So as the pie improves, and when it does, do you think that you will be able to recover that full 100 million in the next fiscal year, and even more than that? Thanks so much. Mick Farrell : Thanks for your question, Maggie. I mean, the short answer is yes, absolutely. Through not just the technology, Jim was talking about the essence, Card-to-cloud but all the other projects, Rob's been talking about the 5 by 5 25 plus matrix of incredible projects that are going through are going to free up supply. And sequentially as we go through this year, we're going to get growth and growth and growth. And so, just to be clear, it was on top of, as Brett said, strong sort of 10% forecast growth, we then had, in addition to that 300 million to 350 million of incremental, that incremental was reduced to 200 to 250, as we as we said today, for this fiscal year that we're in. But that incremental growth, those patients will be there. And we will be in the back when we will get to them in fiscal 23 and more as we continue to grow throughout the fiscal year 2023. It's not like this is an overnight success. And one of the 25 projects works tomorrow. We're all perfect. It's incremental, continuous improvement, step by step improvement of an amazing ops and supply chain team, and an amazing sales and delivery team working with customers on this allocation and understanding how to bring that product to market and understanding on the marketing side to just get ready for the demand gen that's going to need to happen to get all the backlog in and new patients in as we go in, throughout fiscal year 23 and beyond. But the short answer is Maggie. Yes, we will get to that increment and more throughout the coming 12, 18 months. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon everyone. Hey Mick a lot of questions have been answered. Mick, if we layer a recessionary environment on top of an inflationary environment, can you just give us some guidance in terms of new order flow-through, patient behaviour, resupply orders, especially, it almost seems inevitable that there's another complicating factor on the horizon. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Suraj. Yes, look, I mean, clearly inflation is high. And as you've seen, that's been hitting, some of our areas of cost. We have some price mitigation on the AirSense 11. And on global surcharge, and some sort of skews across the range to deal with inflation and to share some of the pain of that that we are seeing from our suppliers with the channel. But so that's, that's how we're sort of mitigating the impacts of inflation. Your question about a future recession who knows we haven't a long bull market. One thing I know that ResMed and I was here through I was actually running the global sleep business through \u201908, \u201909 and \u201810. And I just taken over it the year before and ResMed is remarkably resistant to that global, that global financial crisis. And in recessionary environment, people may forego that extra Tesla, that extra phone for $2,000, but they will not forego that extra CPAP for $1,000 as much. And so we were very recession resistant through that last global financial crisis had a bull bull run here, globally for 10, 12 years, it is possible. Suraj, you're probably better at predicting the timing, or when a recession may come in the next 12, 24, 36 months, I don't know. But I know that as opposed to other consumer industries and automotive industries and fast moving consumer goods, medtech, and particularly consumer driven medtech, like ResMed and sleep apnea. We've been very recession resistant are a very strong player throughout that and give us a competitive advantage, I think of some of the other players fighting for the dollars available. But look, who knows what the timing of any of that would be. But we've got mitigation plans in for inflation. I think very good experience and capabilities to deal with downturns and or, and or recessions. But thanks for the question Suraj. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments. Mick Farrell : Well thanks Kevin, for hanging the phone back. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to once again thank the 8000 ResMedians, many of you are also shareholders through our ESPP. So thank you for that for your dedication and your hard work helping people breathe better, sleep better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. I look forward to talking to you and all of our stakeholders here again in 90 days. Thank you, and we can now close the call. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick. To echo and thank you, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. As a reminder, if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Investor Relations team directly. This does conclude our third quarter 2022 conference call. Kevin I'll turn it back to you to close things out. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. Simply disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of our earnings release and the presentation, both of which are available now. Joining me on the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session, and Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now go ahead and turn the call over to Mick. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today as we review the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended June 30. On today's call, I will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. I'll then review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, and then discuss our actions to navigate through ongoing industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then join the call to review our financial results in more detail. Okay. Let's jump right in. Our fourth quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with high single-digit revenue growth in both our sleep and respiratory care business segment as well as in our Software-as-a-Service business segment. Our ongoing growth reflects our global team's relentless focus to solve very complex supply chain problems and find alternate design and engineering solutions to address the incredible industry challenges that we have faced over the past year and beyond. The global supply chain environment remains very much in flux across multiple industries. We are starting to see indications that the macro environment is improving, particularly semiconductor availability. However, we're mindful that even as macro trends start to improve, we still need our supplier partners to prioritize med tech component needs over other nonlife-sustaining industries. Demand in the market remains very strong. We've been able to mitigate some of the electronic component bottlenecks with the launch of our redesigned card to cloud AirSense 10 devices introduced to the market midway through our fourth quarter. As you can imagine, clearing one bottleneck simply brings the next rate-limiting step to the forefront. Our team is actively working to clear as many bottlenecks as they can as quickly as possible. On the positive news side, the redesign, reengineering and launch of the card to cloud device greatly improved our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in the marketplace. During the last month of the quarter, during June, we were able to allocate more products to our customers than in recent months and in recent quarters. We're not out of the woods yet, but the compass is pointing to true north and we are on top of it. Throughout this crisis of demand and supply, our established ResMed guiding principles remain the same : that is that we will give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest-acuity patients first. As we discussed last quarter, we are still facing a challenging freight environment. The key challenges of sea freight and airfreight are due to reduced availability and elevated prices. These forces are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into our factories and then to get the finished goods out of those factories and ship to warehouses and ultimately to customers. We continue to do everything that we can to secure additional supply to ultimately further increase production of our devices. As highlighted on previous calls, this includes a combination of 5 concurrent work streams in supply chain. One, we are locking in the flow of our existing parts from existing suppliers. Two, we are establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers. Three, we're validating and verifying new parts from existing suppliers. And four, we're validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers. And then finally, five, we're reengineering designs to mitigate the major supply bottlenecks. In summary, we're making good progress with these 5 lines of work, and we've been able to offset some of the impacts of the component shortages to best support patients, providers, physicians and beyond. In addition to the successful launch of our redesigned card to cloud device last quarter, we also continue to support our customers with our market-leading mask portfolio. The supply -- despite the challenges we faced with reduced new patient setups due to a competitor recall, we continue to see strong uptake of our mask solutions as our customers want the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the easiest to fit and the most highly patient-rated masks in the market, and those come from ResMed. Peer-reviewed and published studies have clearly shown that patients that are on a ReSupply program are much more likely to remain on sleep apnea treatment adherent for the long term than those that aren't on a ReSupply program. Our home care provider customers not only want to put new patients on therapy, they want to keep those new patients and all of their existing patients on therapy over the long term. And the ultimate goal there is to improve patient outcomes to lower total health care system costs as well as to drive their own recurring revenue streams. We recognize that this demand outstripping supply situation remains a very difficult temporary state for all customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems as well as the most important customer of all, the patient. We continue to work across the industry to be the best partner and the best solutions provider for all customers. We expect demand to be greater than supply for at least 12 more months, driven by the recall of one of our competitors primarily. The net result is that every device that we here at ResMed make during these next 12 months, we will sell as it leaves the production line to a warehouse and is shipped to a customer. We are looking at every angle to maximize supply and address this incredible demand these next 12 months. As a company, we are learning every day. And as an industry, we will get through this challenge stronger than ever. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, when they need it, and we won't stop until we achieve that goal. Let's now briefly review the COVID-related market impacts on our industry. Most of the 140 countries that we operate in are now above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. It is noted that in some regions and some countries, we see ongoing surges of new COVID variants with some select governments continuing to impose COVID restrictions. In these areas, patient flow remains below pre-COVID levels. But across the board, we are seeing ongoing adoption of digital health solutions for screening, for diagnosis and for remote patient setup and monitoring as well as well-established COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs and physician offices. These trends continue to minimize the impact of new variants and diminish the absolute impact of COVID on our industry over time. Let's now step back a little and review ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities : number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. The launch of our next-generation device platform called the AirSense 11 continues to go very well. It remains somewhat difficult to differentiate the success of the launch from previous generations with the incredibly high demand we're seeing around the world. Every Air 11 we make is sold immediately as it leaves the manufacturing floor. However, when we drill into patient feedback data, we see that patients are very excited about the platform, including the Air 11 device itself and the myAir software solutions surrounding it. During the fourth quarter, we introduced the AirSense 11 into several new countries outside the United States where we first launched the platform, including France, Switzerland and across the Nordic countries of Northern Europe. We look forward to further expansion into additional countries as we progress through our fiscal year 2023. One area that we are closely watching is patient adoption of digital health solutions. And to that point, adoption rates of the myAir app by new patients set up on therapy with the AirSense 11 continue to be more than double that of the AirSense 10. This is because the AirSense 11 platform is designed to enable and encourage patients to engage directly with their own health care. The bottom line is that people want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they love the coaching and personal engagement of our ecosystem. They are voting with their digital presence, and repeat usage of the myAir app is stronger than ever. More patients on myAir means more patients are fully engaging with ResMed's software technology. This has led us to now passing over 12 billion nights of sleep apnea and respiratory care medical data in the cloud. Our software solutions, including myAir and AirView, are delivering a better patient experience, better efficiencies for home care providers and physicians, and most importantly, greater long-term adherence to therapy for the patient. Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health. For our industry, this is specifically seen in the increased usage of home-based sleep apnea tests. Although new patient demand gen is clearly not a top priority in the immediate term given the current supply-demand imbalance, we are maintaining our focus in this area and our long-term investments so that we are ready when conditions improve and we can pivot and fire up our portfolio of demand-gen models and thereby ensure sustainable long-term pipelines of new patients for our industry. With over 1 billion people suffocating every night with sleep apnea worldwide, we see this work as an opportunity, but also an obligation as the market leader in the field. We are innovating with health care system partners and all of our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end-to-end, seamless, digital experience for patients and their caregivers. As we consider opportunities to address the wider sleep market, we are investing in opportunities to address another major sleep disorder epidemic, that of insomnia. Insomnia has been shown in clinical research to occur in combination with sleep apnea, and that's a deadly combination. To this medical need and this medical opportunity, just last week, we announced the acquisition of a company called mementor. This is a German and Swiss digital health start-up that develops and sells digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and beyond. mementor offers the first and so far the only permanently listed digital health application in the field of sleep medicine that is reimbursed by the statutory insurances in Germany. The acronym for these German digital health apps is DIGA, D-I-G-A. This acquisition furthers our efforts to diversify and accelerate growth of our ResMed business in Germany and the potential opportunity with DIGA to expand this offering into other markets around Europe and around the world. There's an unmet need in diagnosing and treating people with sleep problems, such as sleep apnea and insomnia, the 2 biggest sleep problems on the planet and especially when there's an overlap of these chronic conditions. This acquisition of mementor broadens our focus in this vertical from a sleep apnea therapy company to a true sleep therapy company. More to come as we pursue growth in this exciting space in Germany and beyond. Growth trends in the global sleep apnea market are in a state of flux in the short term given the market supply-demand dynamics that we talked about and the recall from one of our competitors. Long term, we estimate the underlying growth trends in the global sleep apnea market to be very strong; in the mid-single-digit range for devices and the high single-digit range for masks. As always, our goal is to drive market demand and to meet or beat market growth through generation of new patients and sales of our market-leading therapy solutions and the introduction of new innovations and alternative treatment pathways that enable us to address even more patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea. Current industry dynamics indicate that we have a multiyear opportunity to drive even greater ongoing acceptance and adoption of our solutions to further solidify our market leadership position. I've challenged our global ResMed team to strive for even stronger growth in the coming months and quarters and the fiscal year and beyond. I'm telling them to go get the share, to go lock in that share with digital health with value that speaks for itself with lower costs, better outcomes for patients and increased efficiencies for the health care system. Turning to a discussion of our respiratory care business. I want to focus on our strategy to better serve the 380 million people worldwide with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, with many others with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation as well as life support ventilation; as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as our cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller team; and high-flow therapy offerings that we are conducting clinical trials on right now, including our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and neuromuscular disease and beyond remains solid throughout the quarter. Ventilation solution demand was supported by the continued success, adoption and scaling of our AirView for ventilation software platform by customers as they experience the benefits of remote monitoring to better manage their ventilated patient populations through remote access to clinical data as well as customizable physician notifications. Let me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care. Our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of verticals, including home medical equipment as well as facilities-based and home-based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software, services and solutions help them achieve both. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for HME solutions as well as home health solutions. We continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and our data solutions to improve and optimize their business efficiencies and their patient care, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply offerings. As businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers more and more in person as well as attend trade shows, host conferences, where the interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare, HEALTHCAREfirst and Citus offerings remain very strong. Earlier this week, I personally attended the Inspire 2022 Conference in Austin, Texas. This is MatrixCare's annual customer summit, and it was in person for the first time since 2019. I had the pleasure and the opportunity of presenting and engaging in person with over 600 customers and partners from home health, skilled nursing, senior living, private-duty home care, life plan community verticals and beyond. The passion for caring for each patient that was involved in every conversation I had this week, the openness, the sharing and the ability for us as a community to move patients to lower-cost, lower-acuity and higher-quality outcome cares, those settings was palpable at Inspire 2022. I came away from that conference even more energized and excited about the opportunities that we have to support customers across the care settings with our digital health and our software solutions. The ultimate goal is that customers of our Brightree- and MatrixCare-branded solutions can provide better care for the people that they serve. Given the passion of our customers and the service levels that we're providing and the product pipeline that was discussed at this conference, I expect we'll continue to not only take share from our competitors across the portfolio, but even drive growth with more tech solutions being adopted by customers across care settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for facility-based verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing and to a lesser extent hospice, where patient census rates below -- remain below pre-pandemic levels. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions and better cleaning, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments in these facility-based areas. This provides opportunities for us to sell more services and more tech solutions to existing customers as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. One MatrixCare customer at Inspire 2022 grabbed me at the conference, and he described what he called a rocket ship acceleration of demand at skilled nursing tech solutions for those skilled nursing customers. This is a really welcome sign for sustainable growth across our SaaS portfolio. So as we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to maintain high single-digit growth throughout fiscal year 2023. As always, our goal is to meet or beat market growth rates, and we will continue to invest and innovate to grow the market and to take share. Our growth in SaaS will come through organic and inorganic growth. We've long talked about our desire to expand our SaaS offerings internationally if and when we found the right opportunity for ResMed. In early June, we announced the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for home health and for nursing home providers in Germany. We've been closely watching the evolution of the German digital health system and the associated outside hospital health care system for many years. And we've actually been closely watching MEDIFOX DAN for a number of years. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business in Europe, and it's a great opportunity to expand our reach in this business globally. We're starting in Germany as it is not only a market where we're vertically integrated in our core business of sleep and respiratory care, it's also one of our largest markets globally and a country where the government is investing in digital health reimbursement. We're excited about the opportunity to accelerate innovation and recurring revenue business models through this acquisition in Germany. As we discussed on the acquisition call that we had in June, MEDIFOX DAN will be immediately accretive to ResMed at close. Progress towards closing this acquisition is moving ahead as expected. We remain on track to close by the end of December 2022 in our fiscal 2023 second quarter. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are well positioned, and we have created a differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed with our SaaS business investments. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. And Bobby Ghoshal and the excitement that he had on Inspire 2022 with the crowd for both MatrixCare and Brightree was an inspiration for me as the CEO of the parent company but also for the whole team there. It's an important part of ResMed's future growth, and I see a lot of opportunities to invest in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe that this is the future of health care delivery, and that's where ResMed competes and it's where ResMed wins. To bring it all together, our strategic focus remains on personal care that is patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric. This triple-pronged approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are very well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease, asthma, insomnia and beyond.  We are transforming outside hospital care at scale. We're leading the market in digital health technology with over 12 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and nearly 18 million cloud-connectable medical devices on people's bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. We have invested in the cybersecurity, the privacy, the cloud ops, the data analytics, the AI/ML capabilities to do this at scale, unmatched by any competitor. And we are increasing our investments and our lead each and every day. Our 2 key global customer-facing software products, AirView and myAir, are 100% in the cloud. Our devices are both cloud-connected and cloud-enabled, making ResMed itself a market-leading cloud-connected and cloud-enabled digital health company. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal this last fiscal year 2022. We changed nearly 141 million lives these last 12 months with our devices, our mask systems, our software solutions, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live higher-quality lives with outside hospital care. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to more than 8,000 ResMedians helping their customers in 140 countries. Your perseverance, hard work and dedication has been impeccable. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had solid financial performance in Q4 despite the headwinds we faced due to significant ongoing supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the June quarter was $915 million, an increase of 4%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and increased device demand generated by our competitor's ongoing product recall. We did not derive incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand during the June quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related demand in the prior year, revenue increased by 10% on a constant currency basis. In relation to the impact of our competitor's recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter. Note, this is consistent with the estimated $60 million to $70 million incremental device revenue in the prior year quarter. For fiscal year '22, this brings the total estimated incremental revenue in the range of $230 million to $250 million associated with our competitor's recall. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a stable to improving supply chain environment. This has given us more confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 12%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 1% in constant currency terms. By product segment globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 11%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 11% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to our competitor's recall. Masks and other sales increased by 13%, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 2% in constant currency terms or excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 7% in the current -- in constant currency terms. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 7% in constant currency terms or excluding COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 9% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the June quarter. We saw a strong performance from our HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing stability in the skilled nursing care segment despite the continuing challenges of COVID-19. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 50 basis points to 57.8% in the June quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to improvement in average selling prices and a positive product mix, partially offset by higher freight component and manufacturing costs, negative geographic mix and unfavorable foreign currency movements. Moving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable growth rate we experienced in Q4 last year. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 6%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 11%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and T&E expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue at 21.1% remained broadly consistent with the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '23. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 7%, or in constant currency terms increased by 11%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% compared to 6.8% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% in fiscal year '23. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 17.6% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the quarter increased by 10%, and our diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 10%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $79 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million; depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $37 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.5 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter in fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $274 million. At June 30, we had $780 million in gross debt and $500 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At June 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, representing an increase of 5% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We recently announced the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and expect to close this transaction before the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as the recently announced acquisition of mementor, a German pioneer and health tech start-up that develops and distributes digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and related areas. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, I'll now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and manage the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from Royal Bank of Canada. Craig Wong-Pan: Mick, you mentioned at the start that you were seeing some improvement in the global supply chain. I just wanted to understand the details around what you meant by that improvement, and when that could start to see improvements to your manufacturing volumes. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. And what we've seen over the last 2, 3, 4 quarters was a really deteriorating supply situation, where we were getting decommits, a word I'd never heard of in supply chain, including my time at BHP and other companies that just -- you never heard of that sort of supply even in commodity industries, and to get it in specialty industries was so unusual. What we're seeing is that sort of noise is starting to go away. And what I'd say is it's a stable to improving component supply environment and that's what we're seeing. But I don't know, Rob, if you want to provide any further color on the supply chain and how we're -- for the details on how we're seeing a supply that's stable to improving on components. Robert Douglas : Sure. Yes, Mick. Craig, one of the sort of fundamental things of supply chain management is ongoing risk management and having sort of the ability to foresee problems and to react through all of that. And then you also manage your risk through inventories and that type of thing. We've over recent months put in place a lot of forward orders, working a lot on relationships with key suppliers. We suspect that sort of global demand on these suppliers is moderating a little bit. And then as Mick says, that means that they're sticking with their commitments at a higher level than what we have seen recently. There are always problems to overcome. And as Mick said earlier, there are other bottlenecks. Once we close one bottleneck, we have to go and work on the next. But overall, I'd say we're feeling better about the forward outlook that we have, and we've got a little more clarity. It's not perfect. There still will be challenges and undoubtedly unexpected things that we'll have to manage through, but the net of it all is that we should see our volumes continue to increase from here. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Chris Cooper : So I noticed, Mick and Brett, no specific guidance on the recall tailwind in fiscal '23. Obviously, I understand the prudence. But I guess just given the importance of the debate, perhaps you can just share your latest thoughts on how you see that dynamic playing out this year. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris, and it's a really good one. But as you know, we've annualized the impact of that competitor recall. And for us now, as I said in my prepared remarks, for the next 12 months, I do not believe there'll be really in the new patient market given the consent decree work they've got to do, the remediation work they've got to do in responding to that and the observations. And so what that means for us is basically demand that is incredible for these next 12 months, and that every device we make will be solved as it comes through the manufacturing line. And so the rate-limiting step on that, as Rob said, will be a bunch of bottlenecks that we'll work our way through. And it's like a game of Whac-A-Mole. We just keep -- find a problem, solve it; find the next problem, solve it. And ResMed is exceptional at that continuous improvement process. Our supply chain teams, our manufacturing teams, our distribution teams have been heroic in the ventilator crisis in 2020 and then the supply chain crisis of '21-'22. And so that gives us confidence to say sequentially every quarter through fiscal '23, we're going to see those volumes improve. And we've got line of sight to that, and we've got interactions with suppliers on that, and we think it's going to go up every quarter. I don't look at this as incremental or temporal taking of share now. This is permanent share taking. We're going to go in, we're going to get the share, we're going to lock it in with digital health solutions. And when somebody uses something that lowers their labor costs by 50%, that improves the adherence rate of the end customer, the patient, to 87%, 9 out of 10 patients getting adherent at day 9 and beyond, that's where we can lock it in. So that's sort of some extra color for you, Chris, but great question. Operator : Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Sean Laaman : Mick, my question is around the card to cloud devices. And is there anything that you note with respect to either compliance rates or resupply potential with card to cloud versus direct cloud connectivity? And is there a view that maybe you get patients that are on card to cloud devices back to the fully charged AirSense 11 at some point? Michael Farrell : Thanks, Sean. Two questions. Card to cloud AirSense 10 is really new. I mean we just really launched it midway through and really in the month of June in the quarter. So it's early days on that. But we've got a lot of experience with card to cloud. I mean think about the S8 and then the S9 with its little SD chip in the back of S9. The product -- when I was running the sleep business, we launched that back in '09 and '10. And we -- so we have a lot of experience with card to cloud. And it's primarily -- the card to cloud, primarily volume has been in the U.S. And that's where we had a very strong digital health system and engagement with our HME partners in a card to cloud environment. So we don't have sort of adherence exact numbers delta between AS 10 C2C versus AS 11.  I think it will be higher, the adherence on the AirSense 11 just because we're getting double the rate of myAir uptake, and that digital health engagement drives higher adherence. And I can tell you as soon as we get clearance on line of sight to those comms chips picking up supply, we'll move everybody to AirSense 11 as soon as we have it.  Probably, we won't go back and retrofit the groups that are there, just because people when they get therapy, they're happy. And the data will go to the cloud, they just won't go to the cloud every day. It will go when the SD card is uploaded on day 30, 60 or 90, and when they see the home care provider and the physician. And so they're not lost patients, they're not lost data. They're still part of the ecosystem, it's just not quite as efficient as it could be. So we're going to get back to AS 11 and really ramping that as fast as possible. But given the supply demand crisis, I was amazed and thrilled that our team was able to pivot in June, get there. And we're going to be able to do that through September and December quarters here as well and beyond. But thanks for your question, Sean. Operator : Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Margarate Boeye : This is Maggie Boeye on for Margaret today. I wanted to ask one on ReSupply, just the trends you're seeing this quarter and if you're continuing to see incremental and permanent share gains within that market as well. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Maggie. Great question, allows us to talk about masks. Despite that competitor not being there for new patient setups where we had a lot of adoption of ResMed masks on their platform as well as ours and then it's not in the market. We saw mask growth rates at 11% constant currency globally. We saw 13% constant currency growth in the quarter on masks in the U.S. And we saw a pretty strong 7% constant currency growth on masks in Europe, Middle East and other markets. And so I actually think that the team and all the work we've done with Brightree and Snap ReSupply in the U.S. and all the work our European and Middle East teams and our Asia teams have done around engaging patients digitally through either myAir or other marketing and adherence programs have performed really well. And despite the headwind of lower new patient setups, we're achieving at or above market growth rates. And to the second part of your question, yes, I do think we're taking share across categories. And I think we're creating new categories by some of our innovations in the different types of comfort and design of the masks, the minimalist masks, the fun comfort masks, the over-the-head masks and -- so creating new segments, taking share in those and being able to lock in that share. Because when a patient gets happy on their mask, like I am with my AirFit P10, they tend to stick with it for life. And it's a great thing for us to be able to do on that. So really excited about it, and I look forward to more mask innovation coming out and more share taking and locking it in over time. Operator : Your next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Matthew Mishan : I guess I wanted to ask a question on the gross margins. Do you have a sense of kind of what the supply issues, FX, retrofitting, all of this is having on your productivity and kind of gross margins in FY '22? Michael Farrell : That's a great question, Matthew. I'm going to hand that to Brett. Any color on GM there for Matthew? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Matthew, I mean it is because we're just trying to maximize the devices out the door with the components that we have. So as you think through that, in terms of manufacturing optimization, that's -- we've really struggled with that. So I do think as we get further through this and some of the supply issues abate, then I think we do have some opportunities there on for manufacturing, think around manufacturing recoveries to significantly improve from where we are. So I do think that's an opportunity for us. It's not immediate, but if you look through the medium term, there is definitely opportunity for us to optimize there. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Steven Wheen : You can hear me here, yes? Michael Farrell : Yes. Got you loud and clear, Steve. Steven Wheen : Yes. Great. Also, just on the gross margin for Brett. We're seeing in freight costs spot prices for shipping and for airfreight coming down by about 30% at the moment from its peak in March. I just wonder when we might start to see that appearing in the gross margin and if there's any changes with regards to semiconductor chip pricing that is worth calling out in more recently. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Steve, it's Brett. The -- Yes, I mean you're sort of seeing some of that or you're seeing some of these freight costs definitely moderate -- some cost reductions, but certainly not manifesting our numbers at the moment. I think we'll get some of that benefit, I would say, in our second half, where we'll probably see some of that coming through. But at this stage, I'd say, look, it's not even in our margin at the moment. But we do have some potential on freight in the second half, both on rates, and I think also we'll skew a little more -- start putting a little more on sea freight as we get through the back of the year as well, and that will certainly help us on our overall freight costs. So again, just kind of that environment where you're seeing some moderation or stabilization. And then I'm seeing as we get through fiscal year '23, some opportunities could be at manufacturing, be on the freight side as well. But we're not seeing that just yet in our numbers. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. David Low : Maybe just continuing on the cost around gross margins. Can I get, perhaps you, Brett, to talk about the impact of inflation, what you're seeing on costs, and what you expect or what we should be looking out for in terms of margins and the impact there for? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean we've seen component inflation, component cost increases. We've certainly seen that in electronic components. We've talked -- we've clearly talked about the freight and the increases that we have seen there. So that's all been built in, if you like, to our cost base at the moment. Going forward, I think we'll still see some of those increases, but I think that's manageable. And then what we've done, as you know, is we've done a little bit on our pricing to customers as well to help offset some of that. So we put through the device surcharge, for example. And we're also planning some modest price increases from July 1 as well. So some of this is going to offset some of that. And -- but I would say, yes, we saw that -- is it accelerating? No, but we're still seeing some cost and component increases coming through. Probably -- I would expect to see that probably for the next little while. But it's not -- we're not seeing any acceleration in that, which I think is good. So I think that there's some offsets there on the gross margin, headwinds on components. I guess some tailwind on ASPs will be benefit for margin going forward. Operator : Your next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Gretel Janu : So just moving back to revenue. How much revenue did the card to cloud contribute in the fourth quarter? And then I guess going forward, do you expect it to be meaningful in FY '23? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel, and it's a really good one. For competitive reasons, I don't want to go into too much detail around it, other than to say that, that pivot of the team during the quarter was incredible. To redesign, reengineer and requalify, validate and verify a device with a new model of card to cloud and get it to market and get it in customers' hands in June was fantastic. So all credit to the team. It was material to our growth in the quarter, and it will be material to our growth up to and when we get those comms chip supply back to the levels that we need it to meet the incredible demand of the marketplace.  So it was material. It was strong, not going to quantify it down to the nth level of detail here. But it provided great additional growth for us in that last quarter and will for the coming quarters. I look forward to the point where I can say we are no longer selling AirSense 10 card to cloud because that means that we've got AirSense 11 connectivity and AirSense 10 connectivity back up to where we need it with that component no longer being a bottleneck for us. But that may be 3, 6, 9, 12 months out there with this incredible demand we're seeing in the market. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Saul Hadassin : Mick, just following up on that card to cloud commentary. Can you just confirm or give us some color as to what happens to those machines once the chip alleviation is completed and you start to get better access to comms chips? Is the intention to bring those devices back and put those chips in? Or if you buy -- if you get issued a card to cloud device, do you effectively keep that device for the next sort of 5 years and then upgrade at some point in the future? Michael Farrell : Yes. So it's a really good question. I think it will probably be the latter part of your question -- or the answer to your question that you gave, which is it will probably be -- when somebody receives a device, it becomes a very personal, very intimate part. It sits on their bedside table. It gives them the gift of breath, the gift of sleep, and it changes their life. And the fact that they may have to take an SD card to the doctor, to their HME provider or have it mailed back and forth won't stop them from having that personal and intimate relationship. So there will be some very savvy patients who will see that and want to upgrade in less than that 3-year -- depending on insurance, 3- to 5-year time horizon. But I think the vast majority of those will remain there permanently. And our job will be to provide the great services around AirView and the engagement that we provide through some of our VoIP. And we do e-mail, text and interactions with patients that go well above just the cloud connectivity from the device itself that we've had in place on our Air Solutions ecosystem for a long time. So I'm very confident we're going to get very high adherence from the AirSense 10 card to cloud people with the ecosystem we have. It will be better with Air 11. So as soon as those components are back there, we'll do that. But I think there'll be a small group of people that will look to upgrade their device before insurance provides it in certain socioeconomic groups in certain countries. Just to be clear, we're really focusing card to cloud right now in the U.S., and that's where we've got a really good ecosystem of home care providers who know how to use card readers and get the data to the cloud and get it into AirView and get it to doctors and engage their patients to drive ReSupply through other means, Brightree, Snap and whole Air Solutions ecosystem. Great questions, Saul. But I think it will be mostly the latter, answer to your own question there. Operator : Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Dan Hurren : Mick, you've been quite specific in the past about these streams of engineering efforts to overcome supply chain shortages, and I guess, including the AirSense 11 range with parts alternate suppliers. So the card to cloud device clearly had a big impact. But do you have any update on the timing of these other initiatives? And will that be a calendar year '22 feature? Michael Farrell : Yes. Dan, it's a really good question. And we have our Chief Operating Officer on the line here who's closer to the other 4 work streams. The fifth one is that reengineering for C2C and beyond. Rob, any color for Dan on all that work we're doing in the supply chain and the reengineering we're doing to -- the streams of engineering work we're doing to increase supply over the fiscal year? Robert Douglas : Yes, Dan. I mean one of the key areas, obviously, is in the columns is around getting access to some of the 5G protocols that are being rolled out. And we're seeing them get rolled out pretty nicely in some markets. And some of our validation, some of those streams are getting access to those types of chips, including we're getting access to earlier-gen protocols as well. And we'll be deploying both of those. I don't think we can give you granularity over it. And it's not without risk in some of the timing. But what we will be doing is as soon as we can deploy and validate and have access to those chip volumes, we'll switch to that as quickly as possible. So it won't actually be a single overnight switch of now, all of a sudden, everything has gone to some new protocol or something; they'll be targeted to markets in specific volumes, and we'll keep doing work on that. As I said earlier, the outlook in terms of the overall demand for these chips from other parts of industries, obviously, cars and phones, may be looking a little better for us. And certainly, people are less likely to allocate away from us. So we're expecting to be able to plan a little more certainty, but we won't be able to sort of publicly give out the exact dates and things like that on those deployments. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. David Bailey : My question is just around consumables and masks and accessories. Are we expecting increased device output over fiscal '23? Just interested in your thoughts on the impact of that on masks and accessories volumes and what that might mean to masks and accessories revenues. And then also, do you think the attachment rates on market share, that those incremental revenues would be higher than you may have seen in the past? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks, David. It's a really good question. And I mean, as you saw in the quarter, 11% CC global and 13% CC in the U.S. in Q4, right, where we're only just starting to ramp up AirSense 10 card to cloud to meet that -- some of that incremental demand gap. Yes, as we talked about every quarter during fiscal '23, we plan to see incremental growth in our volume delivery across the portfolio of AirSense 10 comms, AirSense 11 card to cloud and AirSense 11 comms. And as Rob just described, all those streams that are going to mean we're going to have increased volume every quarter sequentially throughout fiscal '23. And to your question specifically, that does mean that masks and consumables attached to those new patients will add on.  As you know, a very large double-digit percentage of any quarter's revenue on masks and accessories is ReSupply and recurring revenue of the installed base of patients. And so that installed base has been incredibly strong. The engagement of people post COVID in respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and making sure that a clean mask, clean humidifier, clean tubing, it's just been full front with everyone wearing masks for COVID and understanding communicable respiratory diseases like COVID makes them think about respiratory health and hygiene. So that's a permanent change we've seen over the last 12, 24 months in sort of secular demand on the installed base. And then you add to that, that sort of lower double-digit number of the new patients coming in, which is picking up as supply goes.  So I know you guys have all got models on this, David. You've got a good model. You'll start to see that mask and consumable rate pick up. It won't be like a step change jumping up, but there will be a sort of second derivative change, if you like, a little bit of increase in the rate of increase for a while on masks and accessories throughout fiscal year as we get the supply of devices closer and closer to the demand that is out there for these next 12 months, way ahead of where we can get to. But it means every device we make, we sell. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham Company. Michael Matson : I was curious if the card to cloud units are helping your gross margin at all by taking out those -- the other chipsets. I mean is that resulting in some savings that's having material impact on your margins? Or is it not really the case? Michael Farrell : Brett, you want to answer Mike's question? Brett Sandercock : Sure, Mick. Yes, Mike. Yes, so the card to cloud, I mean, obviously, doesn't have the comms module in it, so there is some savings there. So it is positive for our margin, but it would really might just be around the edges. It wouldn't -- like it wouldn't be material. Operator : Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Suraj Kalia : Mick, I'll throw in a two part question, if I could, Mick. For the card to cloud, how much of this shift is tactical and how much of it is strategic? Because the market growth -- you've always referenced 5% to 8% growth for the market. Maybe if you can just parse out how the shift long term would help ResMed's overall device growth.  And if I could quickly, Brett, if I take SG&A in FY '22, right, 8% to 9% year-over-year, and that approximate to about 20% to 22% of revs, my math is around $3.6 billion to $4 billion for FY '23. Is that the right way to think about it? Sorry, gentlemen, for squeezing in the second question. Michael Farrell : Yes. Very cheeky, Suraj, but we'll go at it. I'll go briefly at the first one, then hand to Brett for the second part of your 2-part one question. So the card to cloud, look, it is tactical. It's based on the fact that -- for a very important thing. We have people suffocating out there. They get all the way through the health care system, screen, diagnosed and then get a prescription, and they're waiting for a device. And we said we're not going to have our strategy, which is 100% connectivity in every device through comms chips, get in the way of the patient needs. So it's a tactical pivot based upon the comms chips being in a rate-limiting bottleneck of our supply that we're going to do the AirSense 10 C2C. As soon as that supply moves, we go straight back to 100% connectivity AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 devices. So it's tactical, temporal, and we're going to go back to it.  We're going to do the best we can for those patients, and they're going to get incredible adherence, just won't have all the tech of the daily feedback that you get on those devices with Air 11 and the double myAir uptake that you get with AirSense 11. And that's why I want everyone to get an AirSense 11 as soon as we get the components. And our supply chain team knows that, our customers know that, and we're ready to ramp up over the fiscal year. So a tactical shift. Brett, I'll just quickly say on that -- the second part of the question, I think our competitor put out some numbers that they think the market is today and in 2025. And I think they underestimated the actual market today and the market in 2025 by 25%, 30%, even 35%. I think they were talking about $2.1 billion device market in 2025. For me, it's north of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion, even more than that in 2025, if we get our demand gen and drive it. And we're going to get the lion's share of that. But Brett, any thoughts? Brett Sandercock : Sure. Yes. Suraj, I mean given some broad guidance, I guess, on the SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I wouldn't get drawn into kind of strict revenue guidance. I'd just reiterate what we said before. We're expecting an increase in production volumes, and that should definitely support sequential revenue growth through FY '23. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Lyanne Harrison : I was hoping if you could help us understand the softer device sales in rest of the world a little bit better. Obviously, understanding that you're having that cloud -- card to cloud push in the United States. But can you give us a sense of what the market's like in rest of the world, and what you're seeing from competitors other than Philips in that market? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Lyanne. It's a good question, and it's pretty simple, the answer, in that in Q4 of our fiscal '21, we had $20 million of COVID-related ventilator sales in India. And if we can all remember 12 months ago, there was a huge surge of the COVID variant in India, and we sold $20 million of ventilators to Delhi, Bangalore and across the country to save lives. And it was incredible, the way we pivoted and got those $20 million worth of sales out. Justin Leon and his team did a great job of getting to India. So if you subtract that $20 million of COVID sales out there, you actually see a positive growth -- a good positive growth in devices in Europe, Asia and rest of world. And what you're seeing, to the broader part of your question, is actually in countries where they don't have these, I would say, now illogical COVID lockdowns that are happening in a couple of geographies, China and a couple of other countries are sticking with these lockdowns, we're seeing well over 100% rates of patient flow.  And so incredible demand for our products, both on the ventilation side and on the device side, back to where we were, which is mid-single-digit device growth in the device side and high single-digit growth on the masks and accessories. And we're getting even higher than that, as you saw in the numbers, because we're driving share, we're driving demand and we're getting patients out there. So that's what it all is. But yes -- no, that Europe, Asia, Rest of the world was really just associated with those ventilator sales. Operator : We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Kevin, and thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call today. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank all 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders. And thank you for your hard work, your dedication, helping over 141 million people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives outside the country in over 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. I look forward to talking with all of our stakeholders here on our earnings call in about 90 days, plus or minus. And with that, I'll hand over to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, everybody. We do appreciate your time and your interest. And if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly to Investor Relations. This does conclude our fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out. Operator : Certainly. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the ResMed First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of their earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Mick will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. He'll review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals and discuss the current state of things as we continue to navigate the ongoing macro industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then review our financial results in more detail. And finally, we'll move into the Q&A portion of our call. During the Q&A session, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During our call today, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include some forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2023. These financial results demonstrate solid performance across our entire business, driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as well as ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices and mask systems worldwide. Achieving these numbers hasn't been easy given supply chain constraints, but we are powering ahead focused on the long term. Of course, we see the same macroeconomic challenges that many other industries are also facing as well as an industry-specific issue of a competitor-driven supply-demand imbalance the past 18-plus months, resulting in excess demand for our products. The good news is this. Our global ResMed team demonstrates over and over again their incredible ability to pivot and to solve problems, to support customers and to meet the needs of people around the world with market-leading therapies and software solutions. We are building on the success we achieved last quarter with our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device. Customer acceptance has been strong, particularly in the United States region, and this has enabled us to substantially increase shipping volumes to support patient demand while we continue to fight through global supply chain challenges. It is interesting to note that outside the U.S., we are not seeing the same magnitude of adoption of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device as we are in the U.S. This is due to the fact that our 100% cloud connectable platforms, such as AirSense 11 and others, and our ecosystem of software solutions are so embedded into the workflows of health care systems. This is particularly evident in countries where we have partnered to develop digital health reimbursement models. Customers in countries such as France and Japan and beyond, prefer to work with the limited product flow of our 100% cloud connectable devices rather than change their workflows for Card-to-Cloud models. While this means that some patients will have longer wait times in these regions, it does show the power of our long-term digital health strategy, lowering labor costs, improving efficiency and improving patient outcomes are just too hard to switch from. Nevertheless, on a global basis, the redesign and launch of the Card-to-Cloud device have greatly improved our ability to get closer to meeting the incredible demand in the market. AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud provided meaningful growth for the quarter. And far more importantly, it meant that patients could get access to a world-leading ResMed device to treat their sleep apnea. Clearly, launching this platform to address the spiking demand was and is the right decision. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, obesity, hypoventilation syndrome, asthma and all those who need access to our out-of-hospital health care systems. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it. We continue partnering with our global supply chain to increase access to the critical components that are needed to accelerate production of our medical devices. Last month, I had the opportunity to fly to Sydney and meet many of our supplier partners in person for the first time in 3 years at our Star Supplier event in Sydney. Star is an annual celebration of our partnership with top suppliers. The event was also an opportunity to bring the ResMed story to life for our critical suppliers focusing on the life-saving importance of what we do every day. We showed our suppliers that increased component allocation for ResMed ultimately benefits patients, providers, physicians and all of our stakeholders worldwide. Supplier feedback from the Star event was overwhelmingly positive and many attendees commented how the event helped them to better understand our strong patient focus here at ResMed as well as our commitment to product quality and the patient-driven need for them to increase supply to ResMed. As a consequence of these partnerships, our suppliers are responding positively, and I can share this, we expect steady increase in ResMed's device production each quarter throughout this fiscal year and beyond. Let me now review updates on ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities : number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. The launch and acceptance of our next-generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, more than -- it's more than doubled the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform, with over 60% of all patients downloading and using the app on AirSense 11. We know that patient engagement in their therapy through myAir is an incredibly important part of the therapy process and the ongoing compliance ecosystem due to our clinical publications in the area. Published real-world evidence data show that we achieved 87% adherence rates when our full tech stack is used, including both myAir and AirView. Clearly, increasing production of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for ResMed, and we are doing that every quarter. Additionally, we look forward to continuing to expand AirSense 11 into additional countries as we progress throughout fiscal year 2023 and as we continue to gain regulatory approvals country by country. A key part of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions as well as high flow therapy offerings. During the quarter, our ResMed team presented data at the European Respiratory Society Congress that the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD is much higher than previously estimated. The epidemiology data presented at ERS showed that over 480 million people worldwide have COPD. This is 100 million more than previously published data. As the global population continues to grow and age, we estimate that over 590 million people will have COPD by 2050. This represents a 23% relative increase in global COPD numbers from the baseline of 2020. Combined with the estimated 330 million people worldwide that suffer from asthma, these prevalence figures highlight the importance of treating these chronic conditions with our respiratory care solutions. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care, our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year. The continued trend to move to lower cost and lower acuity locations for care is driving strong growth of home-based care. This is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health software platforms provided under our Brightree brand. We continue to grow with our home care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize their own business efficiencies as well as patient care, including specifically our Snap resupply offering. Census growth in skilled nursing as well as hospice is still challenged by post-COVID patient flow recovery as well as labor shortages. One of our most innovative solutions in this space under our MatrixCare brand has been technology solutions to improve staffing efficiency, improving both staff hiring and management. As post-COVID patient census continues to improve and pent-up demand for technology investments continues to come to the market, we expect to see even more growth opportunities to sell our services and solutions to new and existing skilled nursing and hospice customers. Last quarter, I discussed our agreement to acquire MediFoxDarn, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We are on track to close this acquisition before the end of the calendar year. This current quarter, we're in December 2022. And we remain excited about our opportunity to accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business outside the U.S., and we look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the year ahead. Our integration team is primed and ready. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMed's growth and complements the incredible software and device solutions we have in our core sleep and respiratory care businesses. We see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe this is the future of health care delivery, and ResMed is the right strategic home for these growth businesses. We are well positioned as the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Bringing it all together, we are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. We now have over 12.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 18.5 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating these data to the cloud, and we're unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers and for entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over this last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 144 million lives with our device platforms, our full mask systems and our software solutions in digital health. We're helping people sleep better, helping people breathe better and helping people live higher quality and happier lives with care delivered right where they live. So before I hand over the call to Brett fee's remarks, I want to once again express my gratitude to more than 8,600 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we will open up to Q&A with Brett, me and again. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints. Group revenue for the September quarter was $950 million, an increase of 5%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing device demand generated by our competitors' product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, a weaker euro, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable supply chain environment. This gives us confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets decreased by 6% in constant currency terms. By product segment, globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Breaking it down by regional areas. Device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 23%, as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of our Card-to-Cloud device. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 10% in constant currency terms, mainly as a result of the ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components for connected devices and lower sales of higher acuity devices relative to the strong sales we experienced in the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 9% in the September quarter. We saw particularly strong performance from the HME vertical as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 40 basis points to 57.6% in the September quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to increases in average selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and foreign currency movements. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 10% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and a post-COVID normalization of travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to the 19.5% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for fiscal year '23. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 5% or in constant currency terms, increased by 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '23. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 19.8% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the quarter was $222 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51, both consistent with the same period in the prior year. Note year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 this quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $45 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $36 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $64 million. We recorded equity losses of $2 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $207 million. At September 30, we had $795 million in gross debt and $588 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. At September 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. As reported last quarter, we expect to close on the MedifoxDarn acquisition by the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Additionally, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to further deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thanks, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to call you back on to the call and turn it over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live. Steve Wheen : Just looking at working capital, this one for Brett. We saw the levels of inventory continue to increase. Just wondering how you're going to think about managing Card-to-Cloud inventory levels at a time or as your supply chain starts to free up a little bit more to allow you to make more AirSense 11. Just trying to work out whether there's any risk around inventory obsolescence as you try and transition back towards your latest platform? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Steve, I think at the moment, the market is very much characterized by really excess demand. So we're still trying to meet that, and I think that's going to be with us for a while. So we're building inventory really looking at that kind of future production that we're looking to manufacture. And then we'll manage -- we've introduced Card-to-Cloud, been very successful, particularly in the U.S. market. So that's part of our portfolio. It's important. But we certainly have the plans where I think we can manage that transition between Card-to-Cloud and connected devices as we get more of those components in. So I think it will be kind of a managed plan that will move from manufacturing the Card-to-Cloud to more connected devices as the electronic components come in. But we've got -- we have plans in place to do that and make that transition. Mick Farrell : If I could, Steve, just to add that inventory build that we've had is really a deliberate outcome of our strategy around managing the supply constraints where we've had to really build up the materials components inventories for everything so that we could build the maximum when we break through the bottlenecks on the specific components. And then as the supply chain situation improves into the future, we'll be able to wind back from that. Operator : Next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. Matt Mishan : Just a follow-up on the mask growth. I think you said at one point in the call, that mask growth is still being affected by the lower patient setups. I mean with Card-to-Cloud, was that an OUS comment, a global comment or is that still an issue with the U.S. where we're still below the patient setup? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. I mean if you look at the mask growth numbers in the quarter, we saw 11% growth in U.S., Canada and Latin America. So really strong double-digit growth there and 3% in Europe, Asia and Rest of World with a total global growth of 8%. 2019, we talked about market growth being mid-single digits for devices and high single digits for masks. So we're right there at 8% total growth. But I actually think we could be higher than that if we -- we're taking care of every new patient that's out there. As we said and as I said in the prep remarks, with our competitor out of the market these last 12, 15 months, at least can be 18 months, maybe 24 months out of the market in total. They were the number two player. And we are the number one player, and we're taking as much of the number two excess demand as we can. But we're not getting all of it. Still, even with Card-to-Cloud in the quarter, we weren't getting to every patient that needed a device. And so that delta is what we're talking about, that mask growth could have been even higher. But to your point, because Card-to-Cloud acceptance was so much better in the U.S., we did get better mask growth there. We saw 11% growth in the quarter and very strong. Yes, Card-to-Cloud, as I said in the prep remarks, not being taken up in countries where the whole reimbursement model has changed around digital health and cloud-connected devices such as France and Japan. And it's just structurally difficult, and they don't want to switch from the great efficiencies and outcomes that we get with our 100% cloud connectable systems. So that's sort of the nuance around that. What it talks to is an opportunity to continue to grow our device business, but to even further increase our mask growth, not only in the US, but also in Europe, Asia and Rest of World. Thanks for the question, Matt. Operator : Next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Gretel Janu : So how are you allocating your iron here between U.S. and rest of world, given that the U.S. is adopting the Card-to-Cloud. So are you giving greater levels to rest of world relative to what you historically have the mix between the 2 regions? Mick Farrell : Yes, Gretel, it's a great question. It's a very complex one. And we've actually established during the COVID crisis on ventilators, we established a global epidemiology model, a humanitarian-based epidemiology model where we really looked at the flow of the virus around the world and where we should allocate limited supply of ventilators for that. And I think we did a really good job in that crisis of 2020. We applied those same skills really these last 12, 15 months of having a global team looking at the 140 countries we operate in, looking on a humanitarian basis, as the needs for people who are suffocating now in our core market, suffocating with sleep apnea and other -- on the AirSense 10 platform, we do have other respiratory care and respiratory insufficiency capabilities as well and the AirSense 10 connected devices on bio levels. So we have a global model. We look at allocations based on the demand on patients and the need to get them there. It's a complex and moving dynamic equation. The latest moving apart in it is that AirSense Card-to-Cloud has been coming out the gate incredibly strongly in the June quarter. We talked about 90 days ago and here in the September quarter, and we expect that to continue. That may mean increasing some AirSense 11 allocation to places like France or Japan, where they aren't seeing the same adoption due to the changes there. So it's an ongoing dynamic thing that we look at daily, weekly, monthly in our production, shipping and delivery schedules. So it's not a simple equation. But yes, the impetus of your question was would we look to the humanitarian need and do our best to make sure that device gets to a patient fairly, and that's exactly what we're trying to do on a global basis. It's not simple. It's quite complex, but we're working at it every day. And the team is doing an incredible job, as you saw in these great growth numbers. Thanks for the question, Gretel. Operator : Next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Saul Hadassin : Mick, we've seen a lot of data breaches in the last few weeks, including in the health care space. And on the basis of how much data you guys have access to, just wondering if this is caused you to have a look again about data accessibility and risks associated with potential data hacks and just what your thoughts is on -- thoughts are on the strength of protection that you have. How do you actually protect against something that is happening in the future? Mick Farrell : Yes. So, it's a great question. And obviously, cybersecurity is something we think about all day and every day, and our Chief Information Security Officer and his team are what I would call productively paranoid about the 12.5 billion nights of data and the 18.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices out there in 140 countries. And I did see the news in Australia of a number of health care system hacks. And we've had them here in the U.S. as well, United had one and a number of local health care systems have as well as some infrastructure areas. Look, it's a case of productive paranoia. You have to be investing in this space. You have to be looking at what happened doing root cause analysis of the hacks that have happened. In almost every case, it's been a human, a person clicking on something and giving allocation. And so we're looking very carefully at our training and holding back systems from -- and fixing systems where there are weak links and making sure that all day, every day, you're looking at this because, yes, people are out there. Initially, hackers went to consumer tech and fintech industries. As you said, health care is on their radar. We're probably third on the radar, but we're definitely there. And it's something that we think about and we invest a lot in our cybersecurity protections. But it's an ongoing game of investments and making sure that we stay at or ahead of the curve and how we work with our partners in the health care system to make sure that the data we look at privacy as well as cybersecurity and interoperability. Those 3 have to all be balanced, but cybersecurity is right there as one of our core competencies right now, and we invest a lot in that area. Thanks for the question, Saul. Operator : Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Dan Hurren : Look, I just want to ask about seafreight method. You previously talked about some degree of inventory builds that may shift away from airfreight and had to seafreight. And we've seen other mass participants already do that to sell the group want to ask where you are on that transition and what sort of impact it has on margins. Mick Farrell : Brett, do you want to have a go on that? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Sure. Yes. Dan, Yes. I mean we've moved -- we were almost exclusive are. We've moved some to sea freight. And so that's happening. It's probably -- it's progressive and probably measured because we still want to get inventory to our DCs and then obviously on patients. So we're just trying to balance that. But we have started progressing that to sea freight. So that's happening. Again, we're probably seeing -- we're seeing a little bit of relief or moderation in those kind of freight rates that are coming through. It will take a little bit of time for that to wash through for us. But I still think in the second half, we'll start to see some benefit from some kind of overall freight costs coming down relative to last year. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham. Mike Matson : Yes. I guess just on the international side of the business was quite a bit weaker than the North American side. And I think you commented on the Card-to-Cloud not seeing as much uptake, but I just wanted to see if that was really the primary issue there. Was there anything else going on? Any kind of economic challenges in any of the OUS markets? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And really, truly, the major component is getting Card-to-Cloud in those areas. If Card-to-Cloud had the same adoption in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Rest of World as it did within the U.S., Canada, we would be seeing significantly higher device growth numbers. And so that's -- it's item number one on how we can address that. And actually, in countries where there's no reimbursement models and others, we are pushing towards those Card-to-Cloud as well as increasing, as I said earlier, to Gretel's question, the flow of AirSense 11. One other thing that Brett did note in his prepared remarks was that this quarter a year ago, Europe saw very high sales of ventilators. Some of that was in the COVID space and in the response to some recalls from a competitor space around ventilators in Europe where ventilators, respiratory care is a larger portion of our European business than it is in the U.S. And so that was in the comp on the other side. So those are the 2 main factors that were there. Card-to-Cloud adoption and year-on-year with regard to our noninvasive ventilation, life support ventilation and whole respiratory care business, if you like, in Europe was just a bigger portion of the business there. But thanks for the question, Mike. Operator : Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. David Bailey : Yes. But you sort of mentioned some of the constraints to set up from component shortages in a competitor recall. Just interested in your thoughts on that patient backlog. If you've got any estimates as to how many patients do you think could be waiting for a device, how long it will take to work through? And what that might mean for industry growth relative to that mid-single-digit number you sort of talked to previously. Mick Farrell : Well, look, I'll have a go at that first, David. Thanks for the question. Brett, please and Rob and Dave power on. Look, there's excess demand that's out there with your number two player in a highly competitive market being out of the market for 15 months now, and they say they may be back in January, but I'm not optimistic that they'll actually be back given all the issues that are there for them. And so we look at that and say, let's do as much as we can towards this. We know we are not getting there. When we know the size of the market, we know the total flow of patients. We know what our number one share was, how it's grown, and we're taking care of all of that. We know what their number two share was and how that's grown, and we know we're taking a high double-digit percentage of that, but not all of it. We're not at 100% of it. And so we know there's that gap to fill, which is excess demand. Yes, it does build up to a pipeline -- a great pipeline of patients that are out there. But on the downside, it's tough for those patients because wait times go from days and weeks to weeks and months and from months to quarters in some regions. And so that's why we are and have pivoted for this redesign and reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud. It's why we are redesigning parts and pieces within our AirSense 11 and our AirSense 10 connected devices. And we're ramping up all 3 of those. So if you put it together, we have the number one product in the market, the best product, which is the AirSense 11. We then have the number two best product, which is the AirSense 10 fully connected. And we have the number three best device, which is the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud. And we're selling all three and ramping up all the throughout our Sydney, our Singapore, Atlanta and European distribution centers. And so we're doing the best we can. It'd be very difficult. I mean we do have a lot of quantification on it, competitive reasons, I don't want to go out to exactly what we're looking at. But the timing of how we feel it is dependent upon how fast we get the components and parts and pieces into our Singapore plant and beyond. And those every day, they get better. I said in the prep remarks, that every quarter this year, we're going to make more and more of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, we're going to make more and more of the AirSense 11. You've seen that. We delivered in June. We delivered in September. We will deliver again in December. We'll deliver again in March '23. We'll deliver again in June '23. And so every quarter, we'll give you the update on it. But I almost don't want to quantify it on a time basis because we know what it is on a device basis, I want the time to get shorter and shorter as ResMed accelerates faster and faster towards getting that excess demand and making sure our supply can get us close to meeting it. And then when we meet it, we can then get back to a balanced inventory situation. Operator : Next question is coming from Matt Taylor from Jeffries. Unidentified Analyst : This is Zack on for Matt. I was just curious if you could give some color on supply chain improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis? And any color on how you can reach full capacity over the next couple of quarters. Mick Farrell : Rob, do you want to have a go at that? Rob Douglas : Sure. Thanks, Zach. Yes, Mick was talking before around the quarter-on-quarter, and we're talking device volumes there. And you heard Brett's earlier comment saying we're sort of seeing a stabilizing view of the supply chain. And what had happened in the past was that you think you had a plan, but then these decommits had come through. Now we're definitely seeing a big reduction in the rate of decommits. They're not fully gone. And so there is that sort of still some uncertainty in exactly which products we can deliver on what day because some of the commits can come at -- come out. Other things that are going to help us going forward is that the engineering projects that Mick talked about, including validating new component -- new communications modules. And recall, we're in an environment of the economy and consumer products. It looks like the demand, the excess demand of phones and those types of devices is moderating a bit. The excess demand that autos were creating isn't moderating as far as we can see, and that's still very significant. And in fact, the technologies that we use are more likely to be the types of things in autos than in phone. So there is still some sort of industry pressure on the chip components, but as our engineering projects develop and we get more options validated, we have more likelihood of increasing that volume. And so what we're saying is we're actually producing a huge amount more devices now than we were, say, before the pandemic or even before the competitive recall happened. And our plans, if we can follow it, you can see in our inventories, we've got the parts for it. If we get the final parts in, we'll absolutely keep driving these volumes. And there's risk to the upside. We haven't completely eliminated risk to the downside but we're pretty confident that we're in good shape. Operator : Next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Lyanne Harrison : Just following on the question about how long your competitor might be out of the market. Is that gets delayed or pushed out up to 24 months. Do you think ResMed will be -- have enough production volume as we think about third quarter fiscal and fourth quarter fiscal, enough volume to meet the gap that Phillips has left? And then also, last quarter, you also spoke about some of your demand generation initiatives. Are you at a point now in terms of your visibility on production that you're implementing some of those demand generation initiatives? Mick Farrell : Thanks, Lyanne. It's a really good question with sort of 2 elements to it. One, that's difficult for me to determine because it requires knowledge of the US government from FDA and DOJ and a consent degree with a competitor that I'm not involved in those conversations. I see what we all see publicly out there. And so how long our competitor will be out, we don't know. But we run scenarios on that, right, but they'll come back in January, they come back in July, they'll come back later than that in 2023. And as I look at that, I think about our ability and what we can do in every quarter, we're going to increase production of AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, AirSense 10 coms, AirSense 11 cons. And so if I track those lines up and move them up, there are scenarios where we can get to the full industry demand in calendar year 2023. A lot of things have to come together for that to happen. And there's a lot of scenarios, as Rob said, around parts and pieces coming in and on the other side. But we're doing everything we can to get closer and closer to that. So yes, we can strive towards it, and we're going to move towards it. And we want no patient left behind. We want anyone who suffocates and gets a prescription to have a short wait time no matter what country they're in to a ResMed device and we're doing everything we can to keep up with that excess demand. It will be there for the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months. But as you start to look through 2023, I think, yes, potentially the supply and demand curves could cross over for us and the other players in the industry as well. So how long -- there's a number of scenarios around that, as I discussed. Second part of your question, demand gen initiatives. Yes, we have some really exciting demand gen initiatives from our Asia, Latin America team, the work that we're doing in China and in India and Brazil. These huge population markets to look at different methods of getting to patients and ensuring that care is delivered across socioeconomic bounds and there's health equity and the delivery of our products in these high-growth markets or some really exciting things Justin Leon and his team are driving in our Asia, Latin America demand gen initiatives. And then here in the U.S. market, we've got some really exciting work in our joint venture with Verily called Primasun. I just ran into the CEO of Primasun there at the med tech conference this week in Boston. And there's some really exciting milestones that we'll be looking at throughout calendar year 2023 to drive demand gen to identify, engage and enroll patients. Actually, sleep concern consumers to a pathway to become patients. And so those will start to roll out during the year. In addition, our Western European and Northern European teams and our teams across the world have really exciting programs that, frankly, we've been experimenting and piloting on during the COVID crisis, the embracement of digital health, the embracement of respiratory health, the embracement of care delivered outside the home during the COVID crisis. And actually, during our competitive recall crisis, I think we've seen an ability for us to partner even more closely with our partners in the channel physicians and providers are willing to experiment even more. So I do expect us to turn on a number of these demand gen initiatives throughout calendar year 2023 as we start to get supply up to where demand is and then can drive core demand of the market back again through that demand gen. So great question, Lyanne, and thanks for that. Operator : Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Craig Wong-Pan: Sorry about that. The -- I think there's been some changes with some of the expectations for cost loans like R&D, I think, is now let 6% to 7% of sales versus previously 7% to 8%. And then the Primasun joint ventures, the losses have increased as well. Could you just talk about what's led to those shifts in expectations? Brett Sandercock : Yes, sure. I'll talk to... Mick Farrell : Brett, I think that's a great question for you. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks. Yes. On the R&D, it's just uptick slightly lower. But a lot of that has to do with the weaker Australian dollar. As you know, we've got a decent amount of R&D undertaken here in Australia. So it kind of reflects the lower currency there, Craig. It's not -- it doesn't -- will still be have the same number of more people in R&D and working on that. But obviously, the translation impact is going to be felt as we forecast forward. So that's on the R&D side of things. And your other question? Craig Wong-Pan: The Primasun joint venture has increased... Brett Sandercock : Sort of Mick mentioned that some of the milestones, some of the activities that you're undertaking. So they will look to invest or fund more of those demand gen activities as they kind of move into a more commercializing phase. So that's going to uptick, I think, over the next few quarters. Our share of those costs essentially. So that's why I guided that to be a little bit higher over the next several quarters. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Chris Cooper : Can I ask one on the outlook for pricing? We heard some pockets of feedback late in the quarter that at least one of your competitors is beginning to price more aggressively on masks. Are you seeing that feed through yet? If you do sort of begin to see a more competitive price environment, how would you envisage responding to that? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for your question, Chris. And certainly, pricing is a big topic always in our industry over these last 12 months as inflation around the world has moved from low-single digits to mid-single digits to high-single digits in almost every country we're in, that we've started to respond to that. And as shipping costs have gone up, we've started to respond to that. As you know, at the start of this calendar year, we instituted some surcharges on products in the U.S. and on Europe for those extra costs that were associated with shipping. And then we have, as appropriate, working with customers and within the health care systems increased prices on specific parts and pieces where the costs for us have gone up. And so therefore, we're sharing some of that burden of increased costs with our channel. In terms of -- while appreciating your channel check in the conversation with a customer or 2, I -- we are not seeing across the board major changes in ASPs on either the device or the mask side. It's interesting to note that with our really strong growth of masks, they're 11% in the quarter in U.S., Canada and Latin America. That's in a market where there's no recall from anybody. That's just the standard competitive market, and ResMed is out there fighting for it even with the lower flow of new patients, as we talked about earlier, due to the fact that not every patient who needs a new setup is getting it even though the vast majority of those sales are repeat sales to customers already in our installed base of amazing people being treated every day by ResMed masks. So not a huge sort of impact on pricing right now. If anything, prices are stable to slightly up on devices, and I would say stable in the mask side sort of in line with where they have been. And so no major changes there. Obviously, we watch that. It's a dynamic approach, but we don't focus on price, we focus on value. We talk about how the first time fit with ResMed is where it's at and how the adherence rates are where they are and the mask league is much lower. And customers know that and they track that. And we give them data in our view in myAir and give them all analytics to know how well our masks are doing compared to the competitors. And that's why the doctors prescribe our masks and it's why the HMEs and home care providers around the world choose our masks. So we compete on value, not price. And we look forward to increase competition and increase growth in both the device and mask side. We love a competitive market, and we tend to win in it. Operator : Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Suraj Kalia : Perfect. So Mick, you mentioned about taking most of the excess demand share. Maybe if I could ask my question a little differently, Mick. So let's say we use three buckets. Patients either remain on Phillips, patients switched to ResMed or the third bucket that patients are left to find on their own, right? Let's just assume these 3 buckets. How would the pie charts of existing patients versus new patients coming into the funnel look like? Just trying to understand at a very simplistic level, where are we in the share transfer and what is happening to these patients? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Suraj. And I appreciate the angle you're coming out on it. Let me give you my thoughts on it and address your question from this angle. So I'll put it. I'll say there's 2 buckets. There's new patients and then there's patients getting what we call recap or a device that's 5 to 7 years old, let's say, it's out of warranty maybe, 3 to 5 years and they want to upgrade. And then there's a third bucket of patients who are part of the competitive recall. So the first bucket, which is new patients. Yes, look, there's ResMed and a bunch of small share players competing all day, every day for those new patients and incredible excess demand and every product we make, we can sell into that space. And we are doing very well and taking a lot of share, as you see in the numbers. 23% growth in devices in U.S., Canada, Latin America, 9% growth worldwide in that category of devices. So doing incredibly well in that new patient's bucket. If you look at the existing patients that are looking to retap, right, after three, five or seven years on therapy, I think some home care providers and HMEs in Europe and rest of the world won't be contacting those patients right now. They know the situation. They don't want to get somebody into the channel where the wait times are long. And so I think there's some opportunity for even further excess demand in that second bucket of existing patients looking to retap that haven't been turned on. It's another type of demand gen to Lyanne's question earlier that our channel probably is not turning on much and keeping that dial very low, except for those patients who come and say, \"Look, I really need an upgrade, then they put them in the queue. That's the second bucket. The third bucket is the 5.5 million patients who are on a competitive device from the recall that was announced June a year ago. Our competitor, that's their duty and they are working through those. They're not there. They say they're maybe 3 million into the 5 million. I'm skeptical of that. I think they're talking about production numbers versus delivered numbers. As I look to the channels and speaking to people about how many of the devices that they've asked for have actually been received for as part of that recall. So that third bucket is tough. And so what does the patient do there? Do they just wait? Or do they go get a prescription and try to go spat.com or easybreathe.com or some other retail channel in a different market and try to come in and drive some excess demand that way. It's very hard to determine all of that. We do have some numbers around it. But that third bucket is really the duty of our competitor to take care of, and they're working their way through it. And it looks like it's 18 months through to December. If they get there by June next year, that's 24 months. I'd hope that they are at least there then and can come back. Again, as I said earlier, with the scenarios, we're looking at all sorts of scenarios. I want them back. I love the competitive game. I love beating them in the game of who's got the smallest quite most comfortable and most cloud-connected device that lowers costs and improves outcomes. And we were doing that in 2019. Actually, from the launch of AirSense 10 in 2014 to 2019 for 5 strong years, and I look forward to continuing to do that afterwards. But that's how I'd look at it. Three buckets, new patients are doing incredibly well. Repap, not really turning that dial right now, probably turn it on as we get demand gen. And the third one, yes, we will be getting some of that. We're not fighting for that because that's not where we want to play. That's a competitor's duty to take care of them. And we're focused for the long run. And the 1 billion people worldwide is suffocate who haven't yet been brought into the channel. That's the real opportunity. Thanks for the question, Suraj. Operator : Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : This is Maggie on for Margaret. I wanted to ask on the mass growth specifically and just trying to get a better picture of the resupply trend. So obviously, I can appreciate the amount of new patients coming on service. But maybe if you can kind of talk about the resupply trends and what you're seeing and what we can kind of expect for the remainder of the fiscal year. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Maggie. Look, it's a really good question around resupply. And as you know, looking at our SaaS business through Brightree resupply and Snap resupply, we have some really good models in our SaaS business that's truly the synergy between our SaaS business and our core sleep and Respiratory Care business. And we've got the back-end synergies around cyber securities we talked to earlier, cloud ops and interoperability, but the front-end synergies there around driving resupply have been really strong and Brightree resupply and Snap resupplier are a good part of driving that resupply revenue. Yes. Look, you saw 11% growth, right, in U.S., Canada and Latin America in those resupply. And the U.S. is primarily the market for that where there are very sophisticated models and a very strong incentive for both the patient, the provider and ResMed and actually the payer with the return that they get by reduced hospitalizations to ensure that patients continue to get new masks. Those systems are not quite as evolved or implemented within Europe, Middle East, Africa and Rest of World and so -- and Asia Pac. We do have models, particularly where we're working directly with providers and/or patients to drive resupply models and those are working well. But look, there's a -- I would say there's a lot of opportunity to drive resupply in Europe, middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. And if you look at Catherine Pucknat, and our team in Germany and what she's doing to engage with patients, you look at just in Lyon and what he's doing across Asia and Latin America to engage directly with patients and show them the path to get a fresh, clean new mask on a regular basis and become part of a subscription program for that. There's a lot of innovation to come. So look, I'm proud of the 8% growth in a tough environment with new patients coming in. I want that to get higher. And I certainly want Europe, Asia and Rest of World to go from low to mid- to high single digits again. And we will get there as that resupply and the new patient flow, both come to market. So a lot of moving pieces there, Maggie. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Mathieu Chevrier from Citi. Mathieu Chevrier : Just a longer-term question. How do you see home testing and the Primasun JV impacting the longer-term growth rate of the industry? Mick Farrell : Yes. Look, it's a great question. home sleep apnea testing is now just part of the game. I think what happened during COVID is we were all forced to do telehealth, digital health and to embrace that across the 140 countries that we are in. And we've seen increased adoption rates of home sleep testing across the world. It's just really exciting. Look, if you look at France and Germany, France, it always adopted home sleep testing and very, very good rates of that. Germany really hadn't pre-COVID now has and the physicians have seen it the home care providers have seen it, and we're vertically integrating that market. So we're really driving the adoption if you look at Northern and Western Europe of home sleep testing. And I do think when and if -- I don't know when we get our supply up to where demand is, we can start to turn on those home sleep testing demand gen opportunities because, as I said earlier, 1 billion people suffocating worldwide. We've got less than 20% on treatment in the U.S., less than 10%, 15% in Europe and less than 5% in Asia, less than 1% in some of the high population countries. And so home sleep testing is a really interesting path for that. There were some really interesting sort of viral videos. Our India team is doing a great job. They've actually got an Indian rap star to talk about home sleep testing. We saw a huge spike in the response rate and people going through that. It's really interesting with relatively low cost. These pilots and experiments we're doing with not old schooled media buying a Super Bowl ad or buying an add on Champions League, European football. We're going down to social media levels and using, I would say, very strong interesting experiments around social media marketing to drive demand gen for home sleep testing. And if you ask a person, would they prefer to be tested for sleep apnea in their home or in a hospital, 80% of people say in the home. 20% really should always go to a hospital. They have a comorbidity, history of stroke, history of heart attack, COPD, some other comorbidity or some other sleep disorder. And there are 100 other sleep disorders other than sleep apnea. They're rare, but they're there. So we're going to ramp up home sleep testing in the U.S. with our Verily joint venture, but we're also going to do it directly with all of our home care partners across the U.S. and in the other 140 countries we do business in. So thanks a lot for the question. And I think that will be our last question. We're just running straight up. And one more question, maybe. Amy, what do you think? Operator : Our final question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Steve Wheen : A little squeaking another one. I just wonder in response to the consent decree that Philips is in the process of negotiating. They've obviously done a very large impairment to the Respironics business. Do you have any sort of thoughts as to what they might be needing to contemplate as part of that, whether it impacts innovation, whether it impacts their ability to manufacture just if you had any high-level thoughts as to what you think that decree could look like? Mick Farrell : That's a great question. I'll give some thoughts on hand to Dave Pendarvis, who's not only our Chief Administrative Officer, but also a lawyer and maybe we'll understand that. Look, you have to wait until these things come out. We haven't seen a public discussion of what the consent decree looks like. They're negotiating it now. So when that comes out, we'll look at it. What has been public is a number of responses on that 483 and really specifically talking about culture changes, management changes and a focus on quality. The reengineering and recultural training that, that type of change requires a lot of work. And I would think people will have to move from development and R&D back to what I would call quality remediation and quality systems improvement. So there will be some sort of quality debt, if you like, that would be needed to pay back if you just read through the public information on that 483. But Dave, what are your thoughts and perspective on this? David Pendarvis : Yes, I think you've got it right, Mick. The -- there's a broad range of where this thing could land from sort of a watch and report on the one hand to almost closing down operations on the other end. And without being in the mix of either talking to the agency or talking to the company, which we can't do either one on this particular topic. It's hard to know where they're going to land in between there. But as Mick said, if you look at the public statements, which is both the 483 and also their proposal to take control of the recall, you can see the issues that the agency is concerned about. And so what they're going to want to do is get assurance that those issues are not going to put patients at risk in the future. You've got to have systems in place not only for the products that are issued now but for other products that may be out there on the market or be brought to the market in the future. So except for the agency, obviously, it's a consent decree for a reason. It means that there is an agreement between the parties as to what those parameters will be. And until they announce it, it's really tough to speculate on what the exact details will be. And as I said, there's a pretty broad range. Thanks. Operator : We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments. Mick Farrell : Well, thanks, Kevin, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank the 8,600 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives in residential medicine in over 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do. I look forward to talking with you all right here in 90 days. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, please go ahead. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone. Happy new year and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and the presentation, both of which are available now. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Mick will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results, review our progress towards our ResMed's 2025 strategic goals, and discuss our progress as we continue to navigate the ongoing macro industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then review our financial results in more detail. And we'll then move into the Q&A portion of our call. During the Q&A session, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include some forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We do believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could affect our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks Amy and Kevin and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, our second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our financial results reflect solid performance across our entire business, once again driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as we were able to significantly increase both production and delivery of flow-generator devices. We're seeing ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices worldwide and we're making steady progress, working with our suppliers to continue to increase our production to ultimately meet the needs of all customers and especially patients. Our mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting a post-COVID pandemic awareness of the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. ReSupply programs in the US continued to drive solid, ongoing sustained market mask growth catalyzed somewhat by the end of calendar year deductible momentum in the US geography. Mask sales across Europe, Asia, and the rest of world also improved, driven by increased new patient setups as connected device supply increased. Our teams worked incredibly hard to achieve these extraordinary numbers in the face of an ongoing industry supply chain constrained market. We see the supply environment improving every week, every month, and every quarter, and our access to the specific electronic components we need has increased. We are confident in our ability to fulfill all customer demand before the end of calendar year 2023 and we expect to see steady ongoing incremental device revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 2023. Customer acceptance of our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device remained strong during the second quarter, particularly in the United States geography. As we increase the volume of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices over the next few quarters, we will be able to phase out the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device and refocus on our strategy which is based around the growth of 100% cloud connectable devices across the globe. Outside the US, we have not seen the same adoption rates of that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud Device. However, there have been pockets of success in some geographies and we see a strong growth path going forward as we ramp up our fully connected AirSense 10 and our fully connected AirSense 11 products and as we achieve regulatory clearance of the latter platform market-by-market. To that point, we introduced our newest product, the AirSense 11 platform into the Japanese market during December and we look forward to continuing to support doctors and patients in Japan with our world leading 100% cloud connectable medical devices and our cloud-based software technology. Our number one priority across all of our markets will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, COPD, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, asthma, and all those who need access to out-of-hospital health care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly review updates on ResMed's top three strategic priorities. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in a patient's own home. The launch and acceptance of our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, adoption rates are at more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform at about 55% of all patients getting their data every day on their myAir app. Increasing production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for our ResMedians around the globe and we will continue to achieve better results and stronger market penetration each quarter. Earlier this month, we were able to take our AirSense 10 fully connected device off allocation in the US market. This is a very exciting development for our commercial team here in the Americas and for all of our customers. We look forward to continuing to expand the supply of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices, so that supply can become unconstrained in all countries, but we will progress the throughout fiscal 2023 on this endeavor. An important aspect of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and home-based high flow therapy solutions. We are continuing to drive growth and adoption of our ventilated devices around the world and we saw good uptake of both our life support and our non-life support ventilator platforms during the quarter. There is also ongoing adoption of Propeller's monitoring system. Its digital therapeutic platform is now integrated with the two leading US electronic health record systems Epic and Cerner. This digital health integration makes it easier for doctors and healthcare workers to onboard people to the Propeller platform. It's still early days for this technology, however, combined with our investments in home based high flow therapy for treatment of COPD in the home, we see this technology combination as an important clinical addition for treating lung disease and an integral part -- an important part of our 2025 growth strategy. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service offerings for outside hospital care, our SaaS fast business grew 18% year-over-year. This extraordinary growth includes sustained high single-digit organic growth of our US-based SaaS business at around 7% and is accelerated by the addition of approximately six weeks of MEDIFOX DAN revenue as we closed that acquisition and welcome that German team into the ResMed family of SaaS solutions just over midway through the December quarter. We continue to grow with outside hospital care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. As the post- COVID patients census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments that continue to come to the market. Our HME SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and we welcome tech solutions for our HME customers across the US market. As I just mentioned, during the quarter, we received final regulatory approval and closed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We're now focused on integrating and growing this business as we accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany and beyond. I've met in-person with many of the key leaders of the MEDIFOX DAN team and I can tell you, I'm excited about the cultural fit, the technology focus, the sharing and learning opportunities that they bring and we bring to our global SaaS team. This is our first investment in an outside hospital software business beyond the US market, but I can tell you, the global SaaS team is very much in sync and they have come out of the grade strongly not just in the revenue growth I just talked about, but also in the soft side, team collaboration, transparency, beyond. We look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the quarters and years ahead. Our team is ready to deliver. Our SaaS business is an important part of ResMed's future growth and complements the incredibly strong software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. One great example of the synergies between our SaaS business and our core business is the success of the Brightree ReSupply program. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the insurance company on coverage, and interacting directly with the patient on co-pays as well as managing the logistics and distribution process. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the suppliers that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. We have published clinical data that show that a patient on a ReSupply program has higher adherence to therapy and we also have peer reviewed published data in CHEST showing, what\u2019s called the ALASKA study that there is a 39% reduction in mortality for patients who are adherent to CPAP versus control. These are incredible data and they lead to these synergies not just being a good revenue opportunity, but being an incredible cost-saving opportunity for the healthcare system and life-saving opportunity for the patients involved. We will continue to identify and capitalize on synergy opportunities as we move forward. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care globally, and we have created differentiated value for customers and long term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 13.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 19 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems and communities. We are leading the industry, but I see this as just the start of the digital health marathon. And I can tell you, we love the race. As the overlap between digital health and consumer tech industries continues, it is important to note that ResMed's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Carlos Nunez was recently named Chair of the Board of the Health Division of the Consumer Technology Association, or CTA, and the Health Division is the fastest growing division within CTA. The Health Division focuses on consumer-based technology-enabled health solutions to deliver better health outcomes for patients and reduce overall healthcare costs for the healthcare system. Their mission is fully aligned with our ResMed mission, and I'm delighted to see Carlos be recognized for his leadership and the sessions that he chaired at CES in Vegas a couple of weeks ago, show that ResMed's thought leadership and Carlos' thought leadership is helping to craft the future of digital health and bring it to consumers as we have done over the past decade. We're excited about the ways Carlos and CTA's Health Division can help continue to shape our industry for the future, lowering costs, and improving outcomes, and engaging consumers in their own health care. ResMed's mission and clear goal is to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 149 million lives with delivery of a device platform to a patient, a full mask system to a patient, or a digital health software solution, helping people to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live higher quality lives with healthcare delivered right where they live, and mostly, in their own home. Before I close, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 10,000 ResMedians now for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication both today and every day. Thank you. With that I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move and open up for Q&A from the group. Brett over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue was $1.03 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 20%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing increased device demand generated by our competitor\u2019s product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, the weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. As mentioned, we closed the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition on November 21, 2022 and accordingly, we have recognized MEDIFOX DAN revenue of $10.7 million in our Q2 FY 2023 results from this date. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient electronic components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable and improving supply chain environment. We expect to continue to deliver sequentially higher quarterly device revenue through the balance of fiscal year 2023. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in US, Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 26%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 8% in constant currency terms. Our product segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 25%, while masks and others sales increased by 13%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada, and Latin America increased by 41% as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of the Card-to-Cloud device and improving availability of our connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid ReSupply revenue. In Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 5% in constant currency terms, reflecting the ongoing supply constraints in those markets for our connected devices. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 14% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue, including revenue from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition increased by 18% in the December quarter, driven by continued strong performance from our HME vertical. On an organic basis, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the December quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points to 56.8% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to product mix shifts due to increased flow generator sales as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 20%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs, additional expenses related to our acquisitions, and travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.5% compared to the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 15%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 14%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower gross margin. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 15.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $129 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $38 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.1 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2023 associated with the joint venture operation. On November 21, 2022, we completed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN for consideration of $997 million and this was funded through a drawdown on our existing revolver credit facility. During the quarter, we recorded acquisition related expenses of $8.4 million associated with the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. The acquisition was EPS neutral on a non-GAAP basis in Q2, and we expect the acquisition to be mildly accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of FY 2023. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $253 million. At December 31, we had $1.8 billion in gross debt and $1.5 billion in net debt, reflecting the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. At December 31, we had approximately $390 million available for drawdown under our fleet revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense is expected to increase to approximately $15 million per quarter for the second half of fiscal year 2023, reflecting our increased debt position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to fund at future tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great, thanks, Brett and thanks Mick. Kevin, I'd like to now turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and then run the Q&A portion of our call. Operator : Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Cooper : Thanks. Good morning -- good afternoon. So, good to hear the fully connected AirSense 10 is now off allocation. Can I ask what happens with the C2Cs that have effectively now I presume surplus to requirements? And are there any sort of impacts on pricing or inventory valuation we need to think about in the second half? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Chris and it's a good one. Obviously, we're thrilled to have AirSense 10 fully connected now, unconstrained in the US geography. As you know, we operate in 140 countries worldwide. The AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud inventory, we're working our way through that and it actually is moving very quickly. I'd state it this way that we've got the number one device in the market, which is the AirSense 11 fully connected in terms of customer ratings. We also have the number two device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 fully connected. But then we have the number three device the third best device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, I believe that's better than the tier 2, 3, 4 competitors that are in the market. And so we've got the number one, two, and three device there and we're selling them and different customers want different things. And certainly, the AirSense 11 fully connected is at a price premium. But we'll start to see, I think us work through all of our inventory, the excess patient demand is still there globally. And I think we'll be there for a period of time, even after one of our competitors looks like they may come back into the market, hopefully sometime this this calendar year so that we can get our mask attachment rates on to them. But yes, Chris, we expect to work through all that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud inventory. Good question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Mick, can you hear me all right? Mick Farrell : Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Suraj Kalia : Congrats on a great quarter. Hey, Mick, maybe I'm just trying to thread the needle here, but love to get some extra color. I heard you say by 2025, 250 million lives, that's the plan. If I use where you are currently, let's say 150 million, just rounding it off, that's a 70% almost jump in patient covered life -- covered by CPAP. How should I think about the implied guide? Am I jumping the gun here? Or are you sort of telegraphing you'll should be in a position for the next three years deliver about 17%, 18% CAGR? Thank you. Mick Farrell : Suraj, it's a great question and how we measure the lives changed is a pretty simple formula includes the CPAPs, APAPs, bi-level devices. But it also includes full mask systems, which you know, the sort of linear growth, if you like of the devices and some slight exponential growth of the mask systems because of replenishment rates and repeat customers coming back. But it also includes patients' lives touched through digital health. So, whether it's a Brightree patient who gets access to their device or other HME equipment, whether it's a patient in COPD medicines that gets an app that reminds them to take their medicine on a Propeller, or a patient that has a life support ventilator that gets a digital health reminder to get replenishment. And so combining all those impacts on a life. And the way I look at it is a life is changed as much by a brand new device arriving in their house as it is by an app that helps them take a medicine that keeps them out-of-hospital. So, that's how we sort of look at lives change. Yes, 150 million calendar year 2023, you got it, right. I mean, you got the math, the mathematics there is the CAGR is 17.5% volume growth of the lives that we touch over the next three calendar years through 2025 and we're going to do that. We're going to get more and more patients on CPAPs, APAPs, bi-levels, more and more on ReSupply and masks systems, and then more and more on our digital health platforms. And we've got -- it's a lofty goal and it's a stretch goal, but we believe we can get there and change 250 million lives by 2025. Thanks Suraj. Great question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Mathew Mishan : Hey. Good afternoon, Mick. Just a quick question on the gross margins. Just how has the productivity of manufacturing and shipping improved over the last few months? Are you guys still working through, like high-cost inventory? How much spot buying is there? And then is sort of the decrease in gross margins -- slight decrease in gross margin, mainly on the mix of devices versus masks and accessories? Mick Farrell : Yes, Matt, I'll start and then I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer to cover in detail. But just at the start, yes, there was a sequential decrease in gross margin. One way, Matt, I could have avoided that is tell the team don't sell all those CPAPs and APAPs, to create, right because it was great gross profit dollars to the business and was great to change a patient's life by a new device, but I could have get my GM 70, 80 basis points up by saying slow down those CPAP and APAP sales. Of course, we didn't do that. The right thing is the humanitarian aspect to get those devices that we pivoted, our supply chain reengineered and redesigned to get them to market and you saw extraordinary growth, 41% growth in our US-based device market. Now, that's not our highest gross margin, its diluted to GM percentage, but it's contributory and positive to gross profit dollars. And so it's good for patients, and it's good for our stakeholders. So, that's what we did. But Rob, yes, some a really good question -- first part of the question. Rob Douglas : Yes, Matt, thanks for question. There's lots of factors in that gross margin and you're asking specifically about productivity and productivity improvements. We've done a whole lot of work around volume improvements and really driving volume and all of our discussions with suppliers have been increasing volume and reliability of delivery. Our normal settings in normal world is we have a long-term outlook volume commitment and we're looking at optimization and pricing improvements and things like that. Those activities have pretty well been on hold while we've been doing these -- this sort of real scramble that drive volumes. Freights a similar situation, although we are seeing freights probably going to improve faster than some of these other costs that were in there. But totally in terms of our supply chain culture, we absolutely will be aiming to go back to our continuous improvement situation where we have a really strong volume leverage gain. We continue to drive the volumes in a systematic way and we use that to drive productivity and drive cost out of the system. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live. Steve Wheen : Yes, thanks Mick. I just wanted to follow up on that gross margin question. In the previous quarter, I think it was -- Brett was talking to the efficiencies that you're achieving through doing more volume, was -- the margin benefit from that efficiency was sitting in your inventory balance and that's obviously been building and built again this quarter. I'm just interested is that still the case that when that inventory comes off the balance sheet, you should automatically start to see the efficiency gains that you've been able to achieve to-date? Mick Farrell : Brett, do you want to have a first go of that question? Brett Sandercock : Yes, Mick thanks. So, Steve, yes, I mean, that's -- what we're doing -- I mean -- I think Rob articulated really, at the moment, we're optimizing for delivery rather than efficiency and we got things like we're running the three platforms at the moment. So, I'm really focused on delivering devices to patients. So, that's having an impact. The big one is work through inventory or the wash-through is the freight cost. So, we're seeing some reduction in freight costs. But that's not manifested in our P&L, yet, that's one for the Q3, Q4. So, there will be some benefits that starts wash through into Q3 and Q4 that we're not seeing it that's currently still in inventory. But on the efficiency side, we're really -- we will get there, but we're optimizing on delivery for the moment. But I think as we work through the fiscal, we'll be in a much better position to drive on efficiency measures. Mick Farrell : I\u2019d just pile on there that you look at Brett's guidance, nice conservative guidance is that our gross margin will be sort of steady as we go forward. I look on this and say, I think there's some upside. As we start to see mask rates start to improve, we saw 13% constant currency growth in masks during the quarter. I think, yes, as Brett said, the freight costs will wash through the inventory. And we're getting great scale from the biggest respiratory medical manufacturing plant in the planet, there in Singapore and the efficiency we've got a well above any competitor and we're doing really well on that and I think that'll come through. And then in addition to that, you'll get some upside from MEDIFOX DAN, which is accretive to revenue, gross margin, and EPS, as Brett said, throughout fiscal and beyond. So, that would be my guidance there as well, Steve. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live. David Bailey : Yes, thanks very much. Morning Mick and Brett. Just got a question on new patient growth. Just thinking about patients who have been prescribed the device and waiting and also those yet to be diagnosed, just wondering if you could compare and contrast the US and rest of world? And then some comments on what you think it means for industry device growth for fiscal 2023 and 2024 relative to our historical growth rates? Mick Farrell : David, that's a great question. It's actually the answer. We could take the whole rest of the Q&A session to go through it because it's what we do is trying to reach out to the 936 million people in our core market that suffocate every night with sleep apnea around the world and we're laser-focused on it. As you saw, we delivered very strongly on those new patient setups 41% growth of devices in US, Canada, Latin America and we turned to positive there in Europe, Asia, and other. And what I can tell you is we're really working through that excess patient demand. Those numbers will tell you we're working faster through that excess demand in the US and getting closer to a state you get a prescription and you'll get a device in days or weeks versus it gone up to months there at the peak of the crisis. And I think if you look across the other 140 countries we sell into, every country is different. We've got to get the regulatory approval for AirSense 11 there. We've got to work our way through, but we're going step-by-step on that journey. And so as I look at this excess patient demand, I made the comment there in my prep remarks, I think we will get to all of our customers' demand before the end of this calendar year and that tells you our confidence in increased supply and our ability to meet that need, and we're laser-focused on that humanitarian emergency of patients waiting too long for therapy and we just don't want that you suffocate. This is a case of life and death; we've got the data to show that. We want your path to therapy to be expedited. And in addition to that, the final thing I'll say is that we are looking at our patient demand generation activities that have been on hold these last 18 months. And I'm looking at our models in Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Singapore, UK, and beyond where we have these omnichannel markets availability to contact consumers or sleep concern consumers directly and get them into the funnel. And here in the US, we have direct models and also our joint venture there with Verily and Primasun that we've done some really good demand gen tests and a number of cities just waiting for me to fire the starting gun for that team. And we're getting very close to firing that starting gun. So, we have a smooth flow of -- from excess patient demand to now patient demand generation to continue our growth trajectory. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Mike Matson : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Mick, I think you mentioned high flow therapy in your prepared remarks. I just wanted to get an update on kind of where things stand with commercializing that? And maybe talk about the -- just the market opportunity there? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Look, it's a great question, Mike. And our long-term goals there in 2025, a number of those 250 million lives are going to change in 2025 will be patients with neuromuscular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And two of those great therapies, high flow therapy in the home, I want to be very specific, it's been used in the hospital during the pandemic. High flow therapy in the home, we see as a huge opportunity, probably 10 times the size of our ventilation market in COPD is available for home therapy, HFT therapy. And then Propeller, yes, early days and the pilots are going well. We're integrated to the payer provider EHR systems, which gives us the credibility now to go from pilots to start to scale some payer providers, particularly in the US geography. But Rob, any further details on our work on HFT and cloud connected inhalers for Mike there? Rob Douglas : Yes, Mike. We're pretty excited about this. It's a long-term project though, but as Mick said, we view this as a very large potential market, very significantly larger than some of our other respiratory care markets. And we believe that we're running tests -- we're really focusing on its complementariness with home oxygen therapy that is you'll get much better outcomes if you add this in. And we're working hard on all of the market access and evidence generation programs to do that. Now, most of those programs are buying either RCTs or real-world evidence trials. So, we're sort of in limited market release at the moment in specific markets where we're making these claims. But as that evidence evolves and we generate it and take it to the -- to payers and standard setting organizations, we see this is going to be a very strong market for us, but it is a multiyear project. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live. Craig Wong-Pan: Thank you. Just a question on the SaaS business. The 7% organic growth that you mentioned, I was wondering if much of that was benefiting from price increases or if the price increases you started through the quarter have a bigger benefit to come through in future periods? Mick Farrell : Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. No, that doesn't include a whole lot of price increases. In fact, we put price increases on hold during the COVID pandemic in some of our SaaS businesses and so we probably are changing to the area of price increases as we go forward. We've gone from pandemic to endemic, so that will happen and then flow out over the coming 12, 24 months. I'm really excited. We're looking at that domestic SaaS business in the worst of COVID getting down to low single-digits. We moved to mid-single-digits. And then Bobby, who's President of that division and his team have really accelerated that organic growth to 7% -- 8% last quarter, 7% this quarter, and so that high single-digits organic growth. And actually, we see upside from that in the organic, if you think about it, Brightree, MatrixCare, and Citus Health path. So, we see opportunities to move that up. And then when you add on MEDIFOX DAN and its capabilities, I think the combined business, obviously, the next four quarters, we'll call out the inorganic part will be double-digits on the inorganic, of course. But even going forward, as we look out towards 2025, we see opportunities for high single-digit and even low double-digit growth across that combined business as we lap the acquisition. So, really good growth there. Price increases will be a part of that going forward, but they weren't historically, to answer your question directly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Sean Laaman : Good morning Mick, hope you well. Mick my question is do you have enough visibility on the component pipeline to ascertain when you might be able to provide direct cloud connected devices in those markets that have an aversion to the Card-to-Cloud? Mick Farrell : Yes, Sean, I hope your Sydney morning is going well day after Australia Day. Look, the way we're looking at this is we've got 140 countries. We've got a very complex supply logistics program to get the patients minimize the time from prescription to therapy across all those markets, but it's a complex equation. The good news is we are seeing supply of those rate limited semiconductors for communications. The 3G, 4G, 5G chips are starting to see supply come back. The microprocessors, the next rate limited step are starting to increase and so we're seeing our path through this. And you saw in the quarter, we were able to deliver incredibly strongly on that, and we're off allocation for the AirSense 10 100% connected. Look, I'd love to tell you, we've got a very complex jigsaw puzzle here. I'd love to tell you it will be off allocation on AirSense 11 in all of our markets. It's just not going to happen in the short-term. But as we go through this year, we'll update you as we go off allocation and it will happen market-by-market geography-by-geography. Rob, did I miss anything there? Rob Douglas : The only other comment, Sean, is some of this is driven by regulatory requirements around getting approvals and validations and also, several of these markets have different components that they need. So, they're different validation and engineering projects to do it. And we just have to sequence that through our prioritization process as well. So, that's actually true with all product launches. Mick Farrell : Yes, and the good news is it's not our first rodeo. We've done this launch platforms in 140 countries many times before, and we're back to our sort of meat and potatoes here. This is what we do all day every day. And going off supply chain constraints over the calendar year will be fantastic for us to be able to then just go back to what we do, which is helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside hospital care. Thanks for the question Sean. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live. Margaret Kaczor : Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning to Brett. I wanted to follow-up on the growth drivers as we think about this and next year, because I'm hearing there's patient backlog, obviously, there's core market demand generation that will start to pick up. And then from our perspective, we look at RePAPs as well. So, how do you layer those together over what time period? How much growth could you handle? And then maybe specific to RePAPs, since we haven't talked that much about them on this call, where have they been in the last two years? And when should they return to be a bigger piece of the mix itself? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks Margaret. It's a great question and it's one we're thinking about a lot here. And we're thinking about all three prongs that you talked about. The first one, excess patient demand, how do we work through that. US, we're getting close to really working through it. We've got 140 other countries. And to Rob's point, it's a complex equation to get the supply chain and deliver in all 140, but we're working through that. Secondly, demand generation, yes, where we have omnichannel and have really established social media presences and abilities to drive demand gen, we'll be starting to turn those on country-by-country. And then thirdly, RePAPs, to your point, the last two and a half, three years of COVID crisis, pandemic crisis, competitor recall crisis, we have not turned the knob on RePAP. And in fact, we know our customers have been holding back when they're supply chain constrained on contacting patients who reach that three-year, five-year post-warranty, you're ready for a new device on insurance and/or patient making the call. So, I think all three of those are going to be applied in all 50 states here in the US and in all 140 countries worldwide. We do have scenarios and plans, I'm not going to detail them here on this call, but I can tell you that we expect to see steady growth throughout our market and we're going to drive that. And we're going to make sure that patients waiting lists are not long. We're not going to turn the needles until we're ready to get there in supply. I'm just happy we're having this conversation this quarter and it's so much better than the last eight quarters that we're talking about demand gen and driving RePAPs, because that's what we've done for 33.5 years in the business and it's what we love doing and we're going to do more of it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Matt Taylor : Great. Thank you for taking the question and good morning and good evening. I had a follow-up on that question. I guess I just wanted to understand what are your expectations if and when your competitor does come back? I mean, presumably, there could be some, I guess, impact on flow gens that would create pressure, but maybe you get some pickup in the mask. Could you characterize how quickly you would expect things to change dynamically in both directions? And then how much juice can you actually get out of the demand creation and ReSupply to backfill or you, kind of, increase growth? What are your pilot programs or places where you've done that telling you about how much of a quantitative pickup you can get? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question Matt. I'll start and hand to Rob for further detail because it is a really important area for us. Look, if you think about -- our competitor has been out on the market for 18 months and who knows. They've got to -- we'll find out probably later this week, they got an earnings call, maybe they'll tell us what's happened at the consent decree and give us some timing. Frankly, give the market some time it'd be good. We've run scenarios, they come back Monday February 1, July 1, we've also run scenarios that it's January 1, 2024. And actually, in all those scenarios, ResMed grows and ResMed does really well, and ResMed does a really good job of taking care of the unmet patient need. So, if they come back earlier, come back Monday, we get a 60% plus or minus attach rate of our masks. So, we get good GM contribution, great patient care in terms of the best masks in the planet going to them, and we're able to drive that. Now, they'll be starting from 0%, new patient share, they're going to able to go and fight account-by-account. And they won't be fighting against ResMed out the gate. They'll be fighting against the Tier 2, 3, and 4 players who have come in to fill that part of the equation and they're doing an okay job. And so they have to fight against the okay players. Then they have to fight against us, the market leader. But I look forward to them coming back actually in terms of the mask side of the business, it will be really good. The scenario where it's further out, it's later this calendar year or early next calendar year or beyond. We're okay with that too because we're ramping up our supply, and we're going to get closer and closer to meet all of customer demand in this. So, frankly, it's not irrelevant, but it's not a big perturbation of our long-term strategy and our long-term business. And we've got the scenarios and the little pivots that we need to have more masks or more demand gen in the different scenarios. So, I think investors and some analysts are thinking more about this -- are worried -- more worried about this than we are because we thought so much about it and have the scenarios and the playbook ready for all three of those scenarios and 2020 beyond. I look forward to this sort of people calling a binary. I see there's a mild perturbation of the Monte Carlo sim that really doesn't change in the long-term outcomes for ResMed and our patients is not changed in any of those scenarios. But Rob, any further detail for Matt here? Rob Douglas : Yes, Matt the only other thing I'd add is we sort of think of sort of market growth rate in terms of the patient lifetime journey through this condition -- terrible condition, very serious and the biggest problem is awareness. And so you start off with how do you become aware of it. Does your primary care know to refer you to a sleep specialist? Can that specialist refer you to either home or lab testing? And then do you get a referral to a provider who's got the capacity to look after you. And basically, staff capacity is even a big issue for them. And so -- and then will that provide a look after long-term and keep the ReSupply programs. And our solutions are across all of those, but there's bottlenecks in all of those parts of the patient lifetime -- patient journey, if you like. And as I say, we're providing solutions across that and incrementally driving improvements across all of those. So, that provides a really good long-term outlook for steady growth in the business, as Mick was saying. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Michael Polark : Hey, good afternoon. Two quick ones if I can sneak them in. Is there a vision or strategy to convert Card-to-Cloud products to connected solutions over time? Or is the base case to lead those units that have gone into the market over the last year or so, as is? And then the second quick one is MEDIFOX DAN, the gross margin on that revenue ballpark, can you share what that is? Thank you so much. Mick Farrell : Thanks Mike and cheeky sneaking in two questions, but I'll answer both for sure. Card-to-Cloud, as those devices -- as those AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud devices reach their either warranty period or payer allotted period at which a patient can get another device allocated to them, which is usually in the three years or five years, normally time horizon, those patients will get the opportunity to upgrade their devices from an AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud to presumably an AirSense 11 device. And look, the first 26 years of ResMed's existence, we had, firstly, non-connected and then Card-to-Cloud pager-type technologies sort of sneaker-net. It works. It can get you there. It's not as optimal. It doesn\u2019t get that sort of patient engagement on myAir and all the abilities that we can get to that 87% adherence, but it's darn good therapy. It's the smallest, quietest, the most comfortable therapy. And with the Card-to-Cloud, our HME -- mostly sold in the US, HME customers have done this for years and the data go to the cloud, and so the doctor doesn't see much difference because the doctor is seeing all the data in AirView on Card-to-Cloud and directly connected and so actually able to drive really good care with those patients. So, it will be a bolus of patients over that sort of 12-month period. And we've had, I would say, some pretty good success in humanitarian aid really and showing that ResMed isn't just going to stick to a strategy. It's going to say, if we need to pivot tactically to take care of patients, we'll do it and we'll take care of them long-term. But there will be a bolus of patients, I think, jumping at the front of RePAP in a couple of years who want to get the latest and greatest technology and some on consumer pay markets might go quicker. The second question around gross margin. Yes, look, MEDIFOX DAN accretive to our group gross margin. I'm not going to quantify it exactly, but that's why I said you're going to see, I think, some upside to our GM as we go through the fiscal year, including MEDIFOX DAN. It's accretive to revenue, gross margin percentage, but also NOP dollars and our EPS performance over the fiscal and beyond. Thanks for the questions Mike. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Good afternoon and good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just a quick one. Just the US flow generator growth rate of 41%, obviously, very strong. Just wondering if you can give us any color as to within that, how much was volume versus price and also mix? Mick Farrell : Yes, Saul, look, it's a great question. We don't split out our details on price. But I can give some sort of general color and maybe, Rob, Brett, maybe you want to add a little bit on for Saul to the color that we can provide. Competitive dynamics are very tight. Look, we were very open that we had a surcharge that we put the start of last year around the freight costs that were incredibly high, $12 and EUR12 across all devices and so on. We will start to actually take that away to get customer-by-customer and appropriately as we go through the year. And as we actually see -- to Rob's point earlier, as we see those freight costs come through our inventory, they don't just come in a spot change, it takes time for the COGS reduction there to come through. But in terms of that 41%, I can say it was materially improved by the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud and was able to get those devices there. But our ability, I think, also as we have started this quarter to turn AirSense 10 fully connected off-constraint, I think will continue to be a nice tailwind for our business there. But Brett, I'll hand to you for any further color we can provide to Saul to help on his modeling on this great US flow generator growth. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks Mick. I mean the only thing I'd add, Saul, is that we -- it was really the sleep devices or APAP devices are really strong as we got device availability that went straight into the market. So, that was really kind of driving that, which is obviously higher volume devices than, say, bi-levels, for example. So, that did definitely play a big part in that revenue growth. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. David Low : Thanks so much. Just a quick one. Mick you talked about being unconstrained on supply by the end of the calendar year and then I think to Sean's question, you talked about different markets and regulatory approvals. So, the question I've got is will the AirSense 11 be unconstrained more quickly in the US? And can you give us any sort of sense as to when you expect that will be the case? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question David. Yes, clearly, AirSense 10 fully connected will be unconstrained first just because that platform has been in the market for a long period of time. We've got all the inventory, all the capabilities to drive it, and it's regulatory approved in virtually every market, 140 around the world. And so it's just much easier to turn that off-constraint and get it moving first. But yes, to your point, the smaller, the quieter, the more comfortable and the most connected and most clever device is the AirSense 11. As we get regulatory approvals and we're going country-by-country on this. As we said, we just got Japan during the last quarter and we're going to go country-by-country on this, when we get regulatory approvals and as we get supply starting to improve on those components, we can really ramp that up with all its great technology and really good cost advantages and patient-friendly advantages. It's got coaching capabilities and interaction with the patient on the screen that's interactive and can do some really good over-the-air upgrades, but also over-the-air interactions with physicians and its connectivity to myAir, 55%. I mean almost vast majority of patients are being offered and almost for all them are saying, yes, I want to see my data every day and get a myAir score. So, it will go faster and less constrained in those markets where it has approval. I'm not going to predict the exact date that that will happen because we've got scenarios around that. But I think we will start to see that go off-constraints before the end of the calendar year because that's when we're going to be able to meet all the customer demand, which is our goal and with on a fast-track to do it this calendar year. Rob, what did I miss there on David's question? Rob Douglas : The only other thing is, David, it's been really important for us to be able to supply those two platforms. It's been a great thing for us to have sort of a double. Basically, we've got so much extra capability and capacity because we've got two platform lines designed for the market. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Macquarie -- I'm sorry Marquee. Your line is now live. Dan Hurren : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Look, it's pretty clear that a lot of the growth is now coming from products that have been reengineered and didn't really even exist in their current form a little while ago. So, -- and we've seen AirSense 10 connected as you're talking about launch with different parts and alternate supplies and so forth. But we've also seen some early regulatory approvals for an AirSense 11 with apparently different communication chipset. Is there any reason why that product couldn\u2019t launch within the next few months as you've seen roughly the same time line between approval and launch for something like the AirSense 10 connected? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks Dan. And clearly, you're very diligent looking at FDA and different regulatory approvals around the world. Look, what I'll say to this is that the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud was a reengineered re-pivoted device, absolutely. And the AirSense 10 fully connected, we did rejig the comms chip to get one that was less supply chain constraints. So, those two are reengineering back in the line. We didn't reengineer the AirSense 11 that's selling right now. But of course, there will be variance. This is a long-term platform. This platform, the AirSense 11 is going to do CPAP, APAP, bi-level, all sorts of amazing therapy models. If you even look at the work that we're doing on the Lumis HFT device that we talked about earlier in the Q&A and during my prep remarks, that's on a platform of the AirSense 10 and obviously, AirSense 11 will become the platform of note for us over the coming years. But we don't go into details of our future product pipeline. So, thanks for the question. But look, I can tell you, those three products in the market are number one, two, and three and as you saw this quarter, they're selling well, and we expect them to continue to. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning all. I might just come back to that full customer demand comment by the end of calendar 2023. Mick, is that in relation to just the new starts? Or do you also expect that you'll meet the demand for the backlog of RePAPs as well that we've had over the last few years? Mick Farrell : Yes, Lyanne, you're getting to some of the complexities behind that. Look, our goal is to get off the supply constraint during this calendar and we know we can get there. We won't get there if we turn on every single knob that we have for demand generation and RePAP generation around the world. And so we will be turning those dials, if you like, for demand generation and RePAP generation through our customers and directly as we get supply improving country-by-country. And so yes, I think we can get to all customer demand if we do no change faster, but our goal is to take care of not just the patients who are currently in the pipeline, but also the 80% -- 90% in many countries who are undiagnosed and untreated. And so our mission is to do that and it's aligned with altruism but also our profit motive. And the overlap of those is a really powerful tool for us to have sustainable long-term growth as we have the last 33.5 years. And so clearly, if we turn every dial to max, we wouldn't be able to get off a constraint this year. We won't turn all to max, but we will and we are starting to turn those dials and getting the programs up and running in different cities, different states, different geographies around the world as we start to get off-constraint. So, I won't go into further detail than that to say that, Lyanne, yes, you're digging in, it is more complex than just we get there. It's we get there and then we start turning on the market growth rate as the market leader, which is our sort of our duty and our obligation and we're going to do both. We're going to grow the market and grow our share and deliver for patients. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Steve Wheen, it\u2019s a follow-up from Jarden. Please go ahead. Steve Wheen : Yes, thanks for taking my question. This question is about the diagnosis rate in the US, in particular, for OSA. There has been some frustration to the ability to diagnose patients. So, I just wonder what you're seeing from -- during the quarter from an improvement on that front with regard to diagnosis? Mick Farrell : Yes, Steve, thanks and thanks for coming for your second question at the end of the queue. It shows that the system works and you can get the second question in. It's a good one. Our diagnosis rate in the US, obviously, impacted the start of COVID with all the labs being shut down and then we saw that big pivot and adoption of home sleep apnea testing and some great models from ResMed and many other players in the market to help physicians find ways to remotely screen, diagnose, treat, and manage sleep apnea patients. As we come out from pandemic to endemic in the US, we've definitely seen -- I'd say, our data show that at least 50% of patients are going through home sleep apnea testing. And then of the other 50%, some of them do home sleep apnea test and then just a follow-up in a lab for titration and mask fit and so on. And so really good adoption of home sleep apnea testing. It's sort of related to our demand generation area that demand generation isn't just going out there on social media and advertising and finding that customer acquisition cost and appropriate place well under lifetime value and getting them into the channel. It's also working with the channel to understand where we have capacity, what cities, what geographies that we have. And as you know, Steve following us closely, we purchased a company called Ectosense, and their product called NightOwl. And I have one sitting on the desk right here. This thing is the size of my fingertip and it has the ability to have highly sensitive and specific screening and diagnosis of sleep apnea with reimbursement in a geography like the US, and we're actually experimenting in Asia and Latin America and around the world on this. And the technology is originally European, so hopefully, it gets adopted there, too. I love Ectosense, and I love home sleep apnea testing happening where it's small, it's quiet, it's convenient, and its cloud connected similar to our therapeutics. And yes, so I think you're going to see that diagnostic rate in the US pick up post-pandemic because people learned that telemedicine, digital health, remote screening, remote diagnostics work, and we can scale them. But it won't just be here in the US. It might be pioneered, launched here, and scaled here. but it's going to work in many other countries around the world. And I can tell you we're really excited about partnerships with the physicians and the patients themselves to find their path to better sleep and better breathing. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments. Mick Farrell : Thanks Kevin and thank you again to all of our shareholders and stakeholders for joining us on this call. I'd want to thank once again the opportunity for all 10,000 ResMedians, many of whom of you are also shareholders. So, thank you for that. Thank you also for your dedication, hard work, helping people breathe, sleep, and live better lives in over 140 countries. You delivered these numbers. Thank you for all that you do. And I'll hand back to you, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Mick and thanks everyone for joining us. We appreciate your interest and your time. And as always, if you have any additional questions or need to follow-up, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude ResMed's second quarter 2023 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Hey thank you Kevin. Hello everyone and welcome to ResMed\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the investor relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings press release and the presentation both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel for our Q&A session. During today\u2019s call we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the supporting schedules in today\u2019s earnings release. Our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, however our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks Amy and thank you to our stock holders for joining us today as we review results for the March quarter. Our third quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results reflect very strong performance across our entire business. Through the hard work of our ResMed team worldwide, we\u2019ve been able to steadily improve supply and manufacturing output to deliver for customers, and most especially for patients with now full market availability of our life saving products and Therapy Solutions. During the quarter, we were able to offer unconstrained access to cloud connected AirSense 10 flow generated devices in North America, as well as improved access to those cloud connected devices across our global markets. We continue to work through some supply chain constraints with our latest and greatest AirSense 11 platform, and we expect to steadily improve the global availability of AirSense 11 over the next several quarters. We are thrilled to have the AirSense 10 platform off allocation and fully available to customers in the U.S. and other major markets in swift succession. I would like to send a huge personal thank you to our Six Sigma Black Belt supply chain and our manufacturing teams. Partnering with our global supplier Alliance, we have been able to significantly increase production to the point that we are now able to deliver cloud connected devices to meet the needs of all of our customers in the U.S. And we are working hard to make that the case in all 140 countries that we sell into worldwide as we move forward. Last quarter, we made a commitment to meet the global demand for connected CPAP and APAP devices with a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 by the end of calendar year 2023. As I just noted, we have already achieved that goal in our largest market, and we will be well ahead of that goal across all of our global markets. Supply chain challenges aren\u2019t completely behind us but we have passed the idea in supply and we see steady increases in supply ahead. Our amazing R&D teams and global supplier Alliance teams have designed and validated new components. They have added new suppliers and they have worked hand in hand with existing suppliers to secure the flow of parts that we need. We\u2019re also focused on scaling our manufacturing capabilities with the world\u2019s biggest and highest output manufacturing plant on the planet in the field of respiratory medicine. That high tech facility is now fully up and running in Tuas, Singapore. We are working country by country to secure the necessary regulatory approvals as we ramp production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform across global markets. Given this global ramp plan, we expect to remain on allocation for the AirSense 11 platform for the next few quarters with AirSense10 covering all the difference in demand. With this combination of Air 10 and Air 11. We have the two best sleep apnea therapy platforms in the market. And we are now able to service all of our customer\u2019s needs. Our incredible growth rates of 43% in global device revenue this quarter speaks to that market leadership position of these two platforms, customers are voting with their wallets. Our mask and accessory business also continued to its strong growth trajectory, with 15% global growth in constant currency this quarter across our masks businesses. Mask growth is supported by both new patient growth as well as enhanced resupply programs to existing to existing patients catalyzed by on-going core patient demand. We have now reached the point that new patient flow is well above the levels we saw pre-COVID. In fact, March this we just finished March 2023 was our highest quarter ever for new patient\u2019s setups in our cloud based patient management system called AirView. Our digital health ecosystem enables and drives long-term adherence pushing towards 90% adherence for our highest performing customers. Even as we\u2019ve now past three years since the start of COVID there continues to be sustained heightened awareness by patients of the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. This has been a major step change that has held for now 12 quarters, we consider that a permanent change at this point. In the U.S. market, customers resupply programs including Brightree ReSupply have augmented growth. In our consumer driven markets, outreach programs and subscription programs have also driven masked replenishment rates. Patients want fresh equipment because there is less leak and more comfort for them the person who was suffocating before this treatment. Physicians want fresh equipment because they have seen peer reviewed published evidence that patient resupply is directly correlated to increased patient therapy adherence. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these double digit growth results amid a challenging industry environment. All 10,000 of us ResMedians are laser focused on continuing to live both the devices and masks for our customers globally every week, every month and every quarter. Let\u2019s now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow, expand the reach of and differentiate our core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. Number two, to design develop and deliver market leading devices as well as market leading digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to create, innovate and grow the world\u2019s best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital. The launch of and market reaction to our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, Air 11 adoption rates of myAir are more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform. It turns out that patients love getting their own data every day on their myAir app with a daily score, daily coaching, therapy engagement through advanced analytics and patient focused algorithms. Patient utilization of a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to adherence, which is then directly linked to better patient outcomes as seen by the physician, which ultimately drives better outcomes for the payer and the provider. Given these trends, increasing production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform clearly remains a top priority and an obligation and we will continue to drive market penetration, leading the market, expanding the market as we scale production and achieve regulatory approvals country by country. Meanwhile, we continue to improve the software and digital health technology that drives a significant component of the value proposition for our connected devices. Over the next several quarters, we will introduce several artificial intelligence driven coaching features into the AirView system, as well as on the patient facing myAir app. These AI algorithms will provide personalized suggestions to improve the patient experience and ultimately to increase patient therapy adherence. Many of these AI driven solutions will be available on both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 ecosystems. ResMed\u2019s AirSense 11 device is the best positive airway pressure device on the planet, followed very closely by the second best device, which is the AirSense 10 platform. And together they share the same digital health technology ecosystem. We will continue to invest in the ecosystem supporting these platforms as we innovate solutions for the benefit of physicians, providers, and especially patients. The bottom line is that our digital health technology investments have a multiplier effect across both Air 10 and Air 11 ecosystems catalyzed and powered by AirView and myAir. Pivoting to our respiratory care business, we continue to drive growth and adoption of our bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions around the world as well as investing in our newer to market technologies for patients including neuromuscular disease, COPD, and asthma and beyond. During the quarter we announced a pilot collaboration between our digital therapeutics team under the Propellor health brand, and the University of California Davis Health System. This partnership allows eligible UC Davis Health patients to have access to Propellor\u2019s digital therapeutics platform, including sensors for inhaled medications, a mobile app, a web portal, as well as on-going patient support. Data from the Propeller sensors will be transmitted to the UC Davis Health Electronic Health Record system through an API to support patient enrollment and remote patient monitoring. It\u2019s still early days for this technology. However, combined with our investments in clinical research for home based high flow therapy for the treatment of COPD in the home we see these technology innovations as important clinical additions for treating respiratory disease and an integral part of our 2025 growth strategy, as we now pivot to look beyond to ResMed 2030. Turning to our software as a service offerings for care delivered outside the hospital, our SaaS business grew strongly at 35% year-over-year in the quarter, including the contribution from our recently acquired MEDIFOX DAN team in Germany. On an organic basis, SaaS growth in the quarter achieved high single digit growth of 9% across our SaaS portfolio. We\u2019re excited about the strong sustainable growth of our core SaaS business. And we\u2019re very pleased to see MEDIFOX DAN contributing to our growth in its first full quarter as part of the global RedMed Group. We continue to grow with customers that deliver care outside the hospital, as they increase utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. Here at ResMed, we believe the future of healthcare is in lower cost, lower acuity settings, we are investing in technology that our customers need to operate and scale as patient volumes grow in these facilities and out of hospital facilities. As opposed to COVID, patient census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent up demand for technology investments that continue to come to market across skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes and beyond. Our Home Medical Equipment SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and deliver sustained profitable growth. We are seeing the on-going impacts of staffing shortages across all of the outside hospital healthcare verticals that we serve. This pressure on our customers provides opportunities to drive conversations about the benefits of our software solutions to streamline and drive efficiencies across their businesses, so that they can free up staff to focus on their core purpose of serving patients and improving patient outcomes. Our SaaS business remains an important part of ResMed\u2019s growth strategy, and it complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. Our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate the synergies we can generate between our SaaS business and our core SRC business. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the payer on coverage, communicating directly with the patient, collecting co-pays, and managing the logistics and distribution process of product. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the supplies that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. This results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer. We are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally. And we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 14 point 5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. And we have over 20.5 100% Cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers, and entire healthcare systems. We are leading the industry and we won\u2019t stop innovating. We\u2019re investing 7% of our revenue in R&D. It\u2019s worth noting that the annualized revenue pool is now well north of $4 billion. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. It\u2019s inspiring and it\u2019s exciting. ResMed\u2019s mission remains crystal clear. We have a goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal with our growth over the last 90 days. And during the last 12 months we have improved over 156 million lives with the delivery of the device platform to a patient or a full mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that directly impacts the patient, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live a high quality life with health care delivered right where they live. Let me close my remarks with my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians working across 140 countries for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today, and every day. Thank you. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then get in the queue because we will open up for Q&A from the group. Brett, over to you Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.12 billion an increase of 29%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 31%. Revenue growth reflected improved availability of sleep devices to support the strong underlying demand for these products, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies in particular, weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $20 million in the March quarter. We record an incremental revenue of approximately $15 million from COVID related demand in the March quarter. However, looking forward we expect negligible revenue from COVID related demand. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 32%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 28% in constant currency terms. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 43%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 48% as we benefited from strong demand and improving availability of our connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 14%, reflecting solid resupply and growth in new patients setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales increased by 36% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of connected devices. Masked and other sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software as a service revenue increased by 35% in the March quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HMV vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 9% in the March quarter. MEDIFOX DAN acquisition contributed revenue of $26.6 million for the March quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary, today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 basis points to 56.1% in the March quarter. The decrease primarily reflects product mix shifts use a significant increase in sleep device sales, as well as component cost increases and unfavorable foreign currency movements partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 25% or in constant currency terms increased by 28%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.5% compared to the 21.1% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 14% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7.7% in the prior quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profits for the quarter increased by 27% underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21.1%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 28% and non-GAAP, diluted earnings per share increased by 27%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $283 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and Amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. As of March 31, we had $1.6 billion in gross debt, and $1.4 billion in net debt reflecting the funding of our previously announced MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our revolver debt by $215 million. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we have approximately $605 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, reduce our overall debt levels, and deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett. And thank you, Mick. Kevin, I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Yes, good morning. All. Before I start, I want to say thank you to David Pendarvis. You know, we\u2019re certainly sad to see him retire. But we know that we\u2019re in safe hands with Amy. In terms of my question, obviously some very good device revenue there. But I want to just to talk about the you mentioned the third quarter, you had a new patient high higher than what we\u2019ve seen pre-COVID. Can you provide some comments of how much of that new patient backlog remains? And also what sort of progress you\u2019re making on the Repat backlog? And if you can discuss that, according to the Americas investor [Indiscernible] separately, that\u2019d be very helpful. Mick Farrell : Well, thanks for the question, Lyanne and a tribute to Dave for his 20 plus years, 22 years of I think it was this is his 83rd investor call 83. So amazing tribute to Dave and we are in very safe hands with Amy on investor relations front. To your question. Look, yes, incredible growth, 43% growth in device revenue this quarter to an all-time high. You know, many, many factors that have gone into that primarily that we were able to deliver on our promise to get unconstrained on AirSense 10 a 100% connected devices, we\u2019ve got those end market. And so I think, we were able to take care of all of the demand of customers in the U.S. market period, end of story. We said we\u2019d be there by the end of this calendar year. But we\u2019re they\u2019re already here right now. And as I said in the prep remarks, we\u2019re going to be scaling the AirSense 11, steadily and strongly as that new platform, the latest and greatest comes to market and we move forward. In terms of backlog of those sort of new patients I think we\u2019re there in the U.S. But in terms of REPAPING, I think there\u2019s a lot more to do, and we\u2019re going to partner, across the U.S. with all of our 1000s of home medical equipment companies to start to work through that REPAP program. But I think that\u2019s going to happen over time. We just got to the point where we\u2019re completely unconstrained on AirSense 10 in this quarter. I think it\u2019s fantastic. I want to get unconstrained on AirSense 11. That\u2019s going to take a number of huge numbers of quarters. And then of course, that\u2019s just one country. We\u2019re in 140 countries worldwide, we\u2019re going to go get regulatory and all them and then get those products to market. And so it\u2019s going to be an on-going process over the coming quarters and years to continue there. I\u2019m not going to say that we\u2019re going to see this sort of exceptional 43% growth, on an on-going basis, the market growth is closer to the mid to high single digits in this space. But we\u2019re seeing that market growth come back. We\u2019re seeing the new patients come back. We are through that that pandemic side and we\u2019re getting new patient flow, we see it in our home sleep testing data, we\u2019re looking at all the stuff coming throughout [Indiscernible]. We\u2019re seeing it in the number of patients are being set up, in AirView, all time high. But we\u2019re looking at that every week, every month and every quarter, and it\u2019s steadily improving. And it\u2019s not just the U.S. It\u2019s, it\u2019s in Western Europe, Northern Europe. And it\u2019s and it\u2019s certainly coming through Asia, very strong growth in China over the last number of quarters as we\u2019ve come through the COVID crisis there as well. So that\u2019s my summary there, Lyanne. Great question. Lyanne Harrison : Sorry, can I just clarify when you said that you\u2019re there on the backlog? Is that both for the United States and rest of the world? Mick Farrell : Yes. So we\u2019re through, we\u2019re through the backlog in the U.S. And we\u2019re going to be progressively working our way through the other 139 countries that, it\u2019s it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a complex system, where when you get regulatory approvals let\u2019s say, for the AirSense 11, you\u2019ve got to go region, by region, you can do you know, European Union, but then you have to go country by country for many of these approaches for Brazil, for China for India, and it takes time to get them there to get unconstrained with the two platform approach that we\u2019ve been able to take in the U.S., Canada and a number of other countries. But look, we\u2019ll give you updates over the coming quarters. Lyanne as we get unconstrained country by country, you\u2019ll you will report it to you. And our goal is to be unconstrained everywhere tomorrow. It\u2019s just not logistically possible to be able to do that. So we\u2019re going slowly and steadily to that, but I\u2019m just happy to be, nine months ahead of when we were saying we\u2019re going to deliver an unconstrained at least in some of our top markets here, and we\u2019ll keep you updated as we go forward. Lyanne Harrison : Okay, thank you very much Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Lyanne. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Macquarie. Your line is now live. Dan Hurren : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Someone else asked the gross margin question. But I\u2019d like to ask about the SG&A. And just the fact that it\u2019s remained relatively constant as a percentage rip scent of revenue during the course of the record, which to say a bit counterintuitive, when you consider the fact that the product had been shortages, etcetera, and suddenly was selling themselves. So I just wonder if we could talk about the key elements of that SG&A and the mid-to-long term trajectory there as volumes continue to improve? Mick Farrell : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Daniel, I\u2019ll hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer to cover our SG&A. Rob Douglas : Yes, Dan. So you know how we operate, no matter what\u2019s going on, we\u2019re fiscally disciplined. We\u2019re always keeping an eye on the future and where we\u2019re going and what\u2019s happening as we build, we build in expenses. We absolutely talked about the fact that we weren\u2019t doing face to face marketing, and a lot of travel and those types of things earlier in the pandemic. And as that started to come back, we\u2019ve had to manage carefully how that\u2019s been an extra load on our SG&A. But it\u2019s really, really a factor of careful management. Everyone\u2019s aware of the issue of employee costs, and those things which is which are moving in the time of inflation. And we continue to manage that carefully. And we\u2019re extremely prudent about what we add in on and how we go. And so we really don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves and end up like some of these other companies that have found them way over provisioned in there -- and they go-to-market operations and had to make corrections. So we\u2019re, we\u2019re in good shape, and we\u2019ve got a solid plan. And, we should be able to stick very carefully with our bets our forecast on our SG&A. Operator : Take your next question today. It\u2019s coming from Matthew Silvia [Ph] from Citi. Your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Good afternoon. To those in California. You obviously had a very strong devices growth in the quarter. I was just wondering whether you still believe that you can sequentially grow every quarter in fiscal year 2023 in devices? And then how should we think about FY 2024 and the returns potential return of Philips to the market and whether there\u2019s been any update there? Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, Matthew. And yes, not -- last quarter, I certainly said that we expect to see sequential growth of devices throughout the calendar year, actually here through 2023. And those are forecasts. I got to tell you, this $607.9 million of device sales in the quarter was ahead of where I thought we were at that point. That\u2019s a big number to come up. And as Brett said, there\u2019s about 15 million of ventilator sales to China in there, as they went through another phase of, of COVID as they reopened during the during the March quarter. So if you take that out, it\u2019s still a big number to shoot for here in Q4. But we have the best commercial teams on the planet in respiratory medicine, sales. And you know in Q4, our fiscal year Q4 is a big time there's presence clubs in some geographies, there's fiscal incentives everywhere for people to finish their fiscal year strong. And so there\u2019s a lot of incentives. So it\u2019s a tough number to get there on sequential growth. Taking out those ventilators, I think we can do it, I\u2019m confident my team, I\u2019ll back my team. They got a little bit ahead of me here in March. And I love that I\u2019d love them to be a little bit ahead of me in June. And so I\u2019m confident we can do that. More important than that is that we are now taking care of every patient\u2019s needs in our major markets. And our goal is to be there in all 140 countries. So some of it is that that revenue growth, and it\u2019s amazing, but it\u2019s really about patient care. And it\u2019s about leaving no patient behind. And it was really disappointing. I think, for us as an industry, some of these quarters over the last eight quarters, that as an industry, we weren\u2019t able to take care of every patient that got a prescription. We\u2019re now doing that in our major markets. And we plan to absolutely fulfill that not only where we\u2019ve already achieved it, but to get ahead of it in all the other countries as we go. So sequential growth is good, we\u2019re going to be pushing towards trying that. But more important than that, taking care of every patient in every geography, and working as hard as we can to get to those patients and get them a well quality mask and get them on a resupply program because that\u2019s what leads to long-term adherence, not just that one time device sale, but getting an adherent patient that 87, 90 plus percent adherence rates on not just a 90 day basis, but an on-going basis. That\u2019s our challenge. Matthew, great question. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Gretel Janu : Thanks, good morning all. I\u2019ll ask the gross margin questions. Is the mix really the key driver of the way to gross margins here? Do you have is the higher price offsetting component costs? And just as we look forward, if you\u2019re going to continue to assume strong device sales growth, should we expect gross margins to continue to be weaker at these levels in the short term? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks for the for the question, Gretel. And as you said, and as Brett said in his prep remarks, we had some we had some headwinds on gross margin, which were geography mix, where, it was more in low margin countries, U.S., Canada, and in product mix, we saw more CPAP and APAP growth than we did by level or life support or even other non-invasive ventilators. And so, those headwinds are going to start to subside, but I, I am actually I think Gretel that, as I look forward, I see gross margin expansion in double digit basis points ahead for the coming quarters and throughout the fiscal year and the calendar year. I\u2019m bullish on gross margin expansion because I see geography mix and product mix, headwinds subsiding. I\u2019m bullish on gross margin, as I see ventilator growth, opportunities start to come back and I see mass growth and replenishment growth, new patient growth start to come on masks. And I\u2019m bullish on gross margin as we go forward because I see inventory costs starting to we\u2019re going to start to cut into that and bring them down versus the run up we had with our competitor being out of market. And I also I\u2019m bullish on gross margin, because I see us being able to get better freight costs as we go forward. And as you said, we have been offsetting some of that gross margin headwinds with ASP holding steady in our core business, increasing ASPs in our SaaS businesses. And we\u2019ve had some freight surcharges and others with customers, as we start to see our costs come down, we\u2019ll take away some of those surcharges and so on and so we\u2019ll balance that out. But net net, I see us being able to expand our gross margin and grow as we look forward throughout, not just the fiscal year 2023, but the calendar year here in 2023. Operator : Thank you Next question is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Matt Taylor : Alright, thanks. So sorry, I was on mute. I just wanted to ask about how much we should expect the mask trend to start following the device trends as you become more encumbered. I thought maybe there would be a little bit more mass growth this quarter, not taking away from a good result. But maybe you can talk about that as a derivative. Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks, Matt, for your for your question. And you know that as you look at our masks and accessories business, that sort of 70% to 80% of our masks growth is replenishment, its existing patients out there who are coming back for a fresh mask, a fresh humidifier, a fresh set of tubing, heated tubing, and so on and filters. So it\u2019s the mask and accessories is 70% 80% replenishment business. And so it\u2019s not as directly impact. So new patient growth is incredible. We\u2019re back to better than pre-COVID. And we\u2019re growing from there. And that\u2019s great to see that sort of strong rise of new patients coming in, but it doesn\u2019t sort of directly correlate to your point it\u2019s less a derivative and more a sort of a compounding effect over time as you know like compound interest as you build up that install base those patients are ordering if they are, ordering on a three month or six month basis, that becomes a compounding effect on the device growth today leading to a future investment in growth in masks over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years as you build that installed base, so there\u2019s not a direct correlation 43% device growth doesn\u2019t immediately correlate to mass growth. But I mean, to your point 15% global mass growth on a constant currency basis is incredible pre-COVID, we would have been very proud of a number like that. Post pandemic coming through this growth. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the team and what they\u2019re able to do not just in new patient setups, but in the replenishment programs. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it\u2019s not just in the reimbursed markets where we\u2019ve got formalized systems. In France, the U.S. Japan, we have formalized systems to go with our customers to patients to ensure they if they want it that the patient gets a mask when they need it. We\u2019re also working in our consumer driven markets where we\u2019re driving adherence programs, subscription programs that are fast growing in many of our geographies where it\u2019s cash pay, or direct to consumer interaction, and they\u2019re saying, I want a fresh mask. And so it\u2019s true to the core demand. It\u2019s not just a system driven one, this is a patient driven one. And that\u2019s the part about mass growth that I think is most exciting. Final thing I\u2019ll say on mass growth, is that I think there was some skeptics, two or three years ago, people like oh, this step up in respiratory health and hygiene step up in mask replenishment, that\u2019s a short term trend due to COVID pandemic, with three years since the start of this, this COVID pandemic, and that has been 12 quarters of strong mass growth. So I think that\u2019s strong mass growth is sustainable for the future. We\u2019ve been able to execute for 12 quarters and we plan to continue to do that as we go forward. Matt Taylor : Thank you Mick. Very helpful. Mick Farrell : Thanks Matt. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Michael Polark : Thank you for taking the question. I\u2019ll ask another twist on the mask question. As you\u2019ve better filled on the device side, especially in the U.S., are you -- is there a halo impact in terms of winning share incrementally on the consumables side? Is that a dynamic that\u2019s played out recently or could play out over the next year or so as the device kind of the urgency to step into the device void abates and you refocus on other priorities? Mick Farrell : Yes. Look, Mike, there\u2019s certainly a relationship and when our commercial teams there are working with the best platform, the AirSense 11 and the best second best platform, the AirSense 10, both of which are better than our competitors, they\u2019re also obviously offering the best masks, the best mask portfolio out there, and we have a leading share in that in all 140 countries as well. So there\u2019s definitely a synergy effect in that it\u2019s the same people, talking to the same physicians, the same providers, the same health care systems. And so we\u2019re there. In addition, there\u2019s some sort of clinical technical needs. I mean we design our products to work better together. Our masks on our devices have far more accurate mask leak detection. They have far more accurate detection of pressure and control of an APAP device or a bi-level device, and particularly if it\u2019s used on an overlap patients say, who has obstructive sleep apnea and COPD, you need that IPAP and APAP, the press control to be right on. When you use our buy level with our mask that\u2019s going to be far more accurate and the physicians know that and they will script towards that for those patients. And then for the respiratory therapist doing a setup, they know our products are designed better together. Our teams have shown in the clinical and technical data of how they\u2019re designed. And so there is a strong positive synergy effect. So yes, I do think there\u2019s a correlation with terminal. You can think the sort of simple commercial. I mean, they\u2019re selling it, but then you look at it from the physician\u2019s perspective on clinical and then the therapist perspective on fit and comfort and leak. So I think all that goes together to show there some good synergy between our device growth and mask growth over time. Operator : The next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. David Low : Thanks very much. Mick, can I go back to gross margins. I mean if I heard you correctly, you said you expect gross margins to expand in the double digits in the future. Can you do a little bit on what sort of time frame? And are we talking gross margin percentage? Are we talking gross profits? Just trying to understand what you\u2019re expecting on that front, please? Mick Farrell : Yes, David, thanks. I\u2019m going to hand to Brett to go through more detail. But what I was saying is I expect double-digit basis points improvement from where we were at in the quarter. 56.1%, I see is as an idea, and I want to grow from there. I see us being able to move that up, I don\u2019t know, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 basis points over the coming quarters and beyond. But Brett, do you want to provide a little more detail for David, to the headwinds, the tailwinds and all the fun that goes into gross margin? Brett Sandercock : Yes, sure. Sure, Mick. Yes, David, it\u2019s -- I mean we wouldn\u2019t -- we\u2019re not going to try and quantify, but when we look at it, we do expect margin expansion over the coming quarters. So if you look at some of the key ones that have hurt us year-on-year or it\u2019s around -- it\u2019s product mix, obviously, with a massive increase in sleep devices. We had to deal with component cost increases coming through year-on-year, but that looks to be stabilizing there. So that\u2019s -- there\u2019s 2 big headwinds that we expect will moderate. And then we\u2019re working on manufacturing, logistics, freight costs, we\u2019re looking at efficiencies. So we\u2019re focused back on that now. And that -- again, these should improve over the coming quarters as well. Then on top of that, with the AirSense 11 platform, that does contribute positively to gross margin as well. Now that one will take time as we roll that out. But if you kind of put in the -- I guess, you look at the sort of the headwinds are moderating, we should get a few tailwinds in manufacturing and logistics. And that kind of gives us the confidence we think we can get that expansion from here on in. David Low : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Malgorzata Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live. Margaret Kaczor : Hey everyone thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe follow up on some of the patient demand metrics that you guys gave early on the call. I think I heard maybe high single-digit market growth in the U.S. or Americas. And then should we add repat to that so that, that ultimately leads us to a double-digit growth rate? And then how do you think about that, I guess, once Philips does potentially reenter the marketplace for you guys on a long-term growth. Can you, I guess, continue at that double-digit top line growth rate? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Malgorzata. I think there\u2019s so much that goes into it. But yes, look, we -- we\u2019re on the other side of this pandemic, right? Not only just the pandemics becoming endemic in the way that the world is opening up and we\u2019re driving forward. But in our industry, we\u2019re now seeing that strong growth of patients that we\u2019re really starting to pick up. And yes, it\u2019s mid- to high single digits growth on the patients starting to come through the funnel now, and that\u2019s really strong. How long that\u2019s sustainable and how we can drive it? That\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to be up to us as the market leader. We have the market lead here, and we\u2019re going to drive awareness programs. We\u2019re going to drive demand generation programs. We\u2019re going to partner with I just got an update from a team here in the U.S. market, looking at a project to bring patients into the funnel and to drive patients into the funnel and as the market leader, that\u2019s really our job, so not just accept market growth, but to drive market growth. So this is going to be an active thing that we\u2019re going to be looking at as we move forward. And it\u2019s very exciting for us to do that. I\u2019m not going to quantify it out. I mean given where we\u2019re at, I know you have your models, everyone on the sell side and buy side has their models. But I would say to that, whatever your models are, think about an active leader engaging in digital awareness, marketing awareness and driving and curating patients through the channel. And we\u2019ve learned a lot through the COVID crisis about digital health, about engaging with patients in home testing in remote setup and virtual pathways that have really been necessary at the peak of the pandemic and now become a catalyst for future demand generation. So I don\u2019t know, Rob or Lucie, if you have any extra thoughts on that? Rob Douglas : Just one other minor point, Mick. That that new patient growth is really solid and there\u2019s so many untreated patients. We can see a long-term future in that. But also as we build our long-term adherence programs and start driving long-term adherence, that will keep the mask growth ahead of that new patient growth and we see a long-term outlook for that to. Operator : Next question is coming from Andrew Paine from CLS. Your line is now live Andrew Paine : Yes, Hi morning and evening everyone. Just thinking about your ability to retain market share when Philips comes back to the market, it\u2019s pick up in the -- but assuming from the start of FY 2024, what levers do you think you can pull here to ensure that you do retain market share? Are we looking at kind of things like pricing as a factor? Or do you think there\u2019s other things that will help you retain that share? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. And yes, certainly, look, we look at all competition. We\u2019ve got competitors based in Western Europe and in Asia that we\u2019ve been competing with very strongly for the last few decades and certainly the last 2 years. And 1 competitor who\u2019s been out of the market for new patient setups for 2 years and who knows how much longer, they\u2019ll have to come in that third competitor that will have to come in and start fighting to become the number 2 share player from a 0% new patient setup share. And -- we look forward to that. We were beating that particular competitor in 2019 before they had their recalls. So I know we\u2019ll be able to beat them when they come back in. And so no, our goal is to see 0 share. Our goal is to actually maintain and grow share as the market leader, that gets more and more difficult to take more and more share. But that\u2019s our goal. We have the smallest, quietest, most comfortable and most cloud-connected devices. But more important than that, we\u2019ve created a digital ecosystem that engages patients with myAir, doctors with our view, health care systems by APIs that link into Epic or Cerner in the U.S. and health care systems around the world in U.K. and NHS, Northern Europe into government and Western Europe into government-run health care systems. And we\u2019re engaging with patients in our consumer-driven markets incredibly well. So our goal is to maintain and grow that share. But more important than that, to grow the market. As the market leader, that\u2019s sort of our obligation. There are now with the latest epidemiology rising up around 1 billion people with obstructive sleep apnea that needs to be treated worldwide. And if you add in COPD asthma and insomia, you\u2019re talking 2.5 billion people in our total addressable market. So -- you can think about share, but it\u2019s really not Coke and Pepsi was out and Pepsi is coming back. This is not a low-growth carbonated beverages market. This is a high-growth digital health technology market in med tech, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re driving it forward. But yes, I look forward to just getting the uncertainty out of this number 3 player. I want to back in let\u2019s see and let\u2019s compete and we\u2019ll keep our share and grow it and game on, look forward to it. And actually, one last thing I\u2019ll say on that people have been talking about when the number 3 competitor comes back. How will they come back? Their CFO last week said, Oh, no, we won\u2019t be coming in and lowering prices. We\u2019ll look to take 2019 prices and add with inflation. So game on. I look forward to it. We\u2019ve always competed on value. We\u2019ve always competed on driving that, and it\u2019s never been a competition on price for us. We\u2019ve always been a price premium to the other players, but we save them more money. So that the smart customers are using our products because it\u2019s more profitable. Operator : Next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Matthew Mishan : Yes, hi Mick, you mentioned at one point that you\u2019re getting 90% adherence on some of your best customers. I\u2019m just curious like where that is versus kind of baseline? And how you can move that forward with like the rest of your customer base? Mick Farrell : Yes, Matt, it\u2019s a really good question. And so the peer-reviewed published evidence out there is an 87% adherence number that\u2019s been out there for a couple of years. If you look at the average of the market, where people maybe aren\u2019t using as much of the digital capabilities, the patients aren\u2019t using myAir, the doctors aren\u2019t using AirView. General industry adherence might be on average, 60% to 70%, right, with a competitive device that\u2019s not connected or maybe someone who\u2019s not fully engaged with the digital ecosystem we have. As they start to get engaged, there\u2019s actually a peer-reviewed published evidence on this, just adding just adding the doctor using AirView moves up adherence by 10%. So you go from, let\u2019s say, an average of 65% to 75% for that customer. Just having the doctors AirView, if the patient uses myAir, you move up almost another 10%. So for that example, you might go from 75% to 85% adherence, where the doctor is using AirView and the patients using myAir. To get to those 90s, you need a really special customer that\u2019s really engaged and really investing in tech that takes our tech and sort of adds algorithms, it adds capabilities to it. And we have a number of those sophisticated customers in Europe and the U.S., and we partner with them, and we do joint development with them. And we love that training. We learn from each other. Because together is how we deliver the care. We were a manufacturer and we\u2019re a provider of digital health solutions, we\u2019ve worked with providers in our biggest countries to get there. And where we don\u2019t, in smaller consumer-driven markets, we have to pick up the ball and engage directly ourselves. But that 90% is achieved in very rare cases, but it\u2019s -- that peer view published evidence shows that it can be done with the tech at 87%. And yes, to your point, how do we get everyone up to that 87% that 90%, that is a process of engagement of training. And that\u2019s why I say our share is not only going to stay where it is, but have the chance to grow from that because we are the market leader in this. No one is investing like we are in cloud compute. No one is investing like we are in analytics in AI and ML and engagement with patients and physicians and providers. And we\u2019re not doing alone. We\u2019re doing it with the ecosystem, with the patients. We\u2019re listening to them with the physicians and with the providers. Thanks for the question, Matt. Operator : Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is live. Saul Hadassin : Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just a question on Primasun. I just noticed this quarter, the investment was very low, certainly less than what the guidance had been. So I\u2019m wondering, did something change this quarter? And any update on how that project is going? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. So it\u2019s a great question because let\u2019s just talk to our whole sort of demand generation and engagement approach. I mean, as you know, Primasun is a joint venture with Verily in the U.S. market, looking to digitally engaged -- well digitally identify, engage and enroll patients in a sort of digital health pathway from sleep concern consumer all the way through to diagnosed patient on treatment and management. We have activities through our core U.S. and North America marketing team. And obviously, in the other 139 countries we operate in, we\u2019re looking at other digital ways to engage the 1 billion people who need our help. So look, we\u2019re looking at investments. We\u2019re at a pilot phase of some trials, and we\u2019re getting ready to scale some approach with Primasun, with U.S. programs and many of the others were operating in all parts of the world. And so as we start to roll those out, now that we\u2019re at the point where we\u2019ve got full capability to supply, as we said in the prep remarks and throughout the call, with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 is a combination, we can really turn to start to turn the dial up on these demand generation initiatives with undiagnosed sleep apnea patients. And I\u2019m excited to start doing that. So those investments might pick up a little over the coming quarters, but they\u2019ll have a huge return in bringing patients into the funnel. So watch this space. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon, Mick, can you hear me all right? Mick Farrell : Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Suraj Kalia : Perfect. So first, let me just express my thanks to David. David, wish you have a great retirement. It\u2019s been a pleasure dealing with you all these years. So Mick, a lot of questions have been asked. You comment about AI caught my attention. So Mick think about it this way. Suraj comes in, he\u2019s gone through the CPAP titration, the sleep lab. Certain parameters have been set at a buy level variable, whatever. How would -- what parameters specifically would your AI/ML-based algos telepatient? And the reason I ask is specifically trying to understand how will you use this to improve compliance? Thank you. Mick Farrell : Well Suraj, it\u2019s a really good question. And we only have 5 minutes left in the call. I could spend whole 50 minutes of them. A lot of those things are actually quite proprietary as we put together these AI and ML models on how we would coach a patient, particularly you talk about a high acuity patient like that on bi-level or ventilation, non-invasive ventilation therapy. But look, yes, certainly, I look at our compliance predictors and our compliance analysis tools that can help empower an HME in the U.S. and just some of the ways in which we\u2019re able to use AI and ML to drive prioritization of the most at risk for quitting patients. And those who are so close enough to get there. And those were definitely there and just need some sort of digital coaching. That sort of triage, if you like, which has previously been done manually is now going to an automated way. And it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve always had some levels of that automation, but to have an algorithm that learns as it goes and to get better and better at it -- it just serves the doctor. It serves the respiratory therapists and both of them are super pleased to see that level of efficiency, reduction of if you like, the administrative management and focus on the toughest patients but also making sure that the best patients get the digital coaching and help that they need. So it\u2019s really we\u2019re triaging compliance, adherence and beyond. But watch this space. We\u2019re going to launch a bunch of new products that I\u2019ll be able to talk to very specifically what they are and what they do over the coming quarters. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live. Craig Wong-Pan: Thanks for taking my question. I just note the inventory balances continued to increase. So I was wondering when you might start to see that come down? And also, is there much kind to cloud inventory or parts in that number still? Mick Farrell : Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. It did move up just a little bit in the quarter. I actually have got a very strong target for Andrew Price, President of our operations and the whole manufacturing team to get that number down because we\u2019re through the peak of this, and we\u2019ve got full supply, let\u2019s get that number down. But Brett, do you want to speak to some of the details of how we\u2019re going to turn that inventory number down significantly over the coming quarters and fiscal year? Brett Sandercock : Sure. Sure, Mick. Yes. I mean I\u2019d characterize it, Craig that we stabilized that inventory this quarter and really that drove the really strong operating cash flow that you saw. But I think there\u2019s more that we can do. And the aim is to reduce those inventory levels overall. I mean, a number of things we can do, but some of the -- someone might point out we\u2019re seeing improvement in lead times, which will help. You\u2019ve got I guess, getting from port to port improved a bit, so we can lower inventories. We\u2019re continuing to increase sea freight versus air freight. So some of that manifest in inventory. But eventually, that kind of stabilizes at a ratio, we\u2019re tuning safety stock levels now because we\u2019ve got more predictability on what we need and when we can get supply. And then inventory, obviously, is future looking. So we\u2019re looking to support sales. So we just got to balance all that. But all that said, I think we\u2019re looking for inventory levels, that trajectory to gradually go down over the course of FY 2024. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Cooper : Thanks, Mick. I\u2019m just after your latest thoughts on the diabetes and obesity drugs, please. We -- I guess we had another positive update last night. They do seem to be coming thicken fast at the moment. I guess could you just share how ResMed thinking about these? And to what extent their success may have any impact on your business, please? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes. No, it\u2019s a huge market and actually quite exciting. We\u2019ve always wanted to have interactions. We actually -- when I first joined the company 23 years ago, we were working with bariatric surgeons and looking at patients that would go through bariatric surgery and maybe from 450 pounds down to 200 pounds. And our challenge in those days when it was mostly a CPAP market was -- how do we make sure they get on APAC because their needs -- their AHI might go from 50 when they were at 450 pounds to 30, when they were 250 pounds, but that\u2019s 30 is still severe sleep apnea. So we had to have an APAC algorithm could adjust with them. These days, the market is 80% APAP so you don\u2019t need to make sure that a patient on a, let\u2019s say, a weight loss drug or so on the seasonal weight loss and their AHI needs go down from very, very severely sleep apnea to just severe or moderate to severe. We have the algorithms and the capabilities within the devices with our audit set algorithm to adjust automatically. And we\u2019ll also have all the digital health data. so that the pulmonary doctor can partner up with the primary care or bariatric-type doctor that\u2019s working on -- and presumably be PCP is working the obesity drugs, and they can monitor the patient to see how much better they\u2019re getting, maybe more inherent more participation in their fitness and exercise for the overall health. So for us, actually, and you know we\u2019re invested in one of the sleep apnea drugs. It\u2019s not a weight loss drug that actually goes to the core of trying to treat sleep apnea, which is called Apnemed [Ph]. We\u2019re going to partner with pharma in this space. We\u2019ve seen the substitute of the sort of tiny sort of whatever it is, 0.5% of patient flow into these implanted devices. And there\u2019s a company out there doing, I think that\u2019s a very expensive advertising, but it\u2019s driving lots of patients into the funnel. It\u2019s demand gen for us because they market it as a button to treat sleep apnea, but it\u2019s actually an implanted medical device the size of a pacemaker that goes into the chest when the patient finds that out, they say, Well, what are the alternatives, although they are non-invasive alternative like CPAP or APAP or \u2013 when the patient goes online with that. I think some of the pharmaceutical advertising in this space will drive us to the 80% of undiagnosed patients in the space to say, Hey, look, I\u2019ll take the pill first and maybe then I need sleep apnea therapy or vice versa. But we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to partner here with pharma. We\u2019re already partnering with our Propeller division with some of the COPD and asthma drug delivery. I look forward to not just with Apnemed, but these other obesity drugs to understand how they drive patients into the funnel and how we work with them to treat those patients. Operator : Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments. Mick Farrell : Well, thanks, Kevin, and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on the call. I\u2019d once again like to take the opportunity to thank the 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do and for investing in our company as well. Thank you for your dedication and hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. You delivered these numbers that we just reported. Thank you for all that you do. I\u2019ll hand the call back to Amy, and then we\u2019ll close out. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, Kevin, and thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. If you do have any questions -- additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our third quarter 2023 conference call. Kevin, you can now close this out. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to ResMed's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you so much, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings press release and the presentation both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Lucile Blaise, President of our Sleep & Respiratory Care Business for the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. Please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to our GAAP reported numbers. Our discussion today will also include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the Risk Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results of our June quarter, the last quarter of our fiscal year 2023. Our results reflect incredible growth across our entire business with double-digit growth in our devices, masks, and software businesses. Unconstrained availability of our market leading cloud connected flow generator platforms has enabled us to continue to offer access to 100% cloud connectable AirSense 10 flow generated devices in all of our major global markets and beyond. In parallel, we are ramping up and improving the availability of our best-in-class AirSense 11 platform, which will gain further geographic regulatory approvals throughout the fiscal year and steadily increasing supply also throughout the fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Although challenges within the post-COVID supply chain haven't completely been mitigated yet, we expect ongoing steady improvement in component and end product supply in the quarters ahead using a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. While we remain focused on scaling production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform, we remain on allocation for the Air 11 platform for the next few quarters. But I want to be clear on this point. With combined availability of the unconstrained Air 10 platform, we have enough devices to meet all of the customer needs that we see in major markets and globally. With the powerful combination of the Air 10 and the Air 11 platforms, we have the two best device platforms on the market. Our strong double-digit 23% year-over-year growth in the devices category demonstrates that customers are choosing ResMed and we are delivering. Our masks and accessories business also performed at a very strong 18% growth in constant currency this quarter. Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these strong growth results amid a challenging industry environment where component costs and freight costs are still working their way through our inventory post this supply chain crisis. I'm proud of the work that 10,000 ResMedians have put in every week, every month, every quarter to deliver these incredible results for the business, for our customers, for our shareholders, and ultimately for our most important customer, our patients. Let's now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business; number two, to design, develop, and deliver market leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate, and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. In terms of our patient facing digital health platforms, adoption continues to go very well. The feedback we hear from patients and healthcare professionals remains very positive. We are seeing strong adoption of the myAir patient app by folks using AirSense 11. In fact, it is more than double the adoption rate that we saw with our AirSense 10 platform with many, many millions of patients signing up and engaging daily on their myAir app to view their own sleep data on their own phone and to review their own therapy data. This is important as engagement with a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to higher adherence to therapy in patients. And higher adherence to therapy is directly related to better patient outcomes, to increased resupply and to better economics for the payer and the healthcare provider with lower overall healthcare costs. Last month, we announced and closed the acquisition of Somnoware. Somnoware is a U.S.-based leader in sleep and respiratory care diagnostics software and physician management software. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline the end-to-end pathway for patients and make it easier for sleep labs and physicians and their practices to diagnose and manage patients, we're excited about this acquisition that complements our current ecosystem of software solutions, including AirView for providers and physicians and Brightree for home care providers. These ecosystem together will drive greater efficiency and better patient care by accelerating the pathway to therapy and with a better overall customer experience. We're also excited about our progress across several digital health technology initiatives to further increase the value proposition for our connected healthcare ecosystem. Over the next several quarters, we plan to introduce several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities on both the physician and provider facing AirView platform, as well as the patient facing myAir app. Early testing of these AI driven data products is very positive in both of these customer groups, and we will refine to the optimal digital design and then we will launch and then we will scale these products around the world. These AI driven data products provide personalized suggestions to increase therapy adherence and to ultimately improve patient outcomes as well as patient, physician, and provider experience. We will continue to invest in the world's largest digital healthcare ecosystem that we have with over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud as we continue to unlock value from those data to benefit physicians, providers, payers, and patients. We saw strong growth in our respiratory care business in the quarter through ongoing adoption of our non-invasive ventilators as well as our life support ventilator solutions. We're still in the early stages of market development with some of our newer to market technologies in this category, including home-based high-flow therapy that we call HFT for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD in the home. We continue to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We're encouraged by the clinical results we've seen with our HFT trials so far, and we continue to remain very focused on addressing COPD as one of the top diseases globally for hospitalization and the number one cause of re-hospitalization in the U.S. geography. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focused on having low cost, high quality solutions to address this health epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 34%. Our SaaS business growth was supported by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business, as well as solid organic growth of 8% across our Brightree and MatrixCare portfolio of SaaS businesses. We're pleased to see sustained high-single-digit growth in our SaaS business on an organic basis, driven by the ongoing strength in the HME and infusion segment, and more stability in the facility segment as patient flows have now rebounded post-COVID. I'm very impressed by the leadership of our most recent SaaS portfolio addition MEDIFOX DAN, which is on track and meeting or beating our expectations. I'll be visiting personally with the team in Hildesheim, Germany, this quarter to discuss the growth face-to-face with the digital health innovators there in Hildesheim who are changing healthcare and taking care of people in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest quality of life setting, which is very often the home. We believe this is the future of healthcare and that's where we're investing and that's where we're winning. Our customers continue to see the value of adopting technologies to improve and optimize business efficiencies and personalized care, and we deliver the best software solutions to help customers do just that. There is pent-up demand for technology investments in residential medicine verticals, particularly as staffing shortages continue to impact the industry, particularly in nursing, but across the clinician and provider groups. This presents opportunities for ResMed's SaaS solutions to streamline operations and create workflow efficiencies so our customers, staff can focus on providing personal care. It's up to us to deliver for our customers and drive growth. I have confidence that our SaaS business can accelerate from these high-single-digits on an organic basis to double-digit growth on an organic basis in the mid to long-term. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. As an important example, our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate strong synergies between SaaS and our core business, providing resupply for patients with sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond. The output of this work can be seen in our very healthy 19% growth in mass revenues in the U.S. geography this quarter. Ultimately, this work results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer with lower overall healthcare costs. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. We have created differentiated value for our customers as well as long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Here at ResMed, we are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our businesses. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations in this post-COVID world, we continue to leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive accelerated growth in our bottom line. We are focused on driving top-line revenue and maintaining tight discipline and increasing efficiencies so that we can lower costs and ultimately so that we can accelerate our impact and our bottom line profitability, delivering even further value for all of our shareholders. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I see improvements in our business margins with geography mix, with product mix, and specifically with strong bi-level and non-invasive ventilator growth with strong mass growth and with increased software solutions growth. All these business lines are margin accretive to our growth. I also see that the higher inventory costs and freight costs that we've seen through the supply chain crisis continue to work their way through our sold products and as we progress through the fiscal year, we will continue to drive the transition to AirSense 11 and we will gain regulatory approvals and we will scale production. All these factors above lead to tailwinds for the gross margin and the net margin of our business as we move through the fiscal year. I can tell you we are working furiously to drive all of the above elements with our global teams. We now have over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud, as I said earlier, and those data come from over 21.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health and we don't plan to stop anytime soon because there's so much opportunity ahead of us. 7% of our revenues go straight into R&D to power our hardware and our data innovation engines. ResMed's mission and key goal remains crystal clear. We will improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last 90 days and during the trailing 12 months, we have improved over 160 million lives with the delivery of a complete device platform to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that is helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live a high quality life with healthcare delivered right where they live. As we start fiscal year 2024 here, I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. We just had our SaaS ASM earlier this week, and I'll be attending the Country Market Group CMG Group for our North America team in the coming weeks. And sales meetings are happening around the world. We're on a good trajectory. We have an exciting pipeline. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication both today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move and open up for Q&A for the group. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q4. Group revenue for the June quarter was $1.12 billion, an increase of 23% on a headline basis and in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of cloud connected AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support strong underlying global demand, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $3 million in the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 25%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 14%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 24% while masks and other sales increased by 18%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America increased by 30% as we benefited from strong demand. And as previously mentioned, our continued ability to fully supply the market with combined availability of AS 10 and AS 11 cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 19%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 14% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 34% in the June quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 8% in the June quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $27.3 million for the June quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 points to 55.8% in the June quarter. The decrease primarily reflects component cost increases; warranty and manufacturing related cost increases and product mix shifts due to the significant increase in sleep device sales partially offset by increases in average selling prices  On a sequential basis, unfavorable foreign currency movements accounted for the 30 basis points decline in our gross margin and we saw a lower than expected product mix benefit as we continue to see strong growth in sleep devices in the U.S. market. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 25%, or in constant currency terms increased by 26%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs marketing and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&A expenses associated with MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 21.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year 2024. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 21% or in constant currency terms increased by 23%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% during fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 13% underpinned by strong revenue growth partially offset by lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter is $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount per quarter in the first half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 17.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 7% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 7%. During the quarter, we incurred $1.8 million in acquisition expenses associated with our Somnoware acquisition, and we recognized restructuring costs of $9.2 million associated with the closure of the Aria lymphedema business and workforce rationalization in our German and SaaS business verticals. We also recognized a gain of $20.2 million within our income in relation to a business interruption insurance claim. These have all been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q4 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $34 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $47 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. At June 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt, which mainly reflects the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $145 million. At June 30, we had approximately $745 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, representing an increase of 9% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as our recently announced acquisition of Somnoware, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Kevin, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&A portion of our call. Operator : Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Matthew Mishan : Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. Hey Mick, with the devices number sort of steady sequentially around this $600 million mark, is this where the number would kind of base out if you are supplying the majority of the market? And from here, are we looking at just saying $600 million and then add on some percentage of what the underlying fleet market is kind of growing at? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Matthew. And it's a good one. It's hard to predict because there are so many factors involved that that are going on in the market right now. But yes, as you said, a very, very solid number, $602 million in global devices in the quarter and 30% growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America, 15% growth in Europe, Asia, and rest of world. Look, we're seeing a strong sort of mid-single-digits level of patient flow into the channel. We're seeing in addition to that -- like in terms of new patients, we're seeing in addition to that resupply of patients at that five-year point for most U.S. reimbursement and various points in the other 139 countries where people make their own decisions or insurance has other criteria to drive that. So it's new patient setups, it's resupply setups and there's of course the impact of a competitor recall, which is -- was supposed to be over in June 30 and now has no definitive date. And so as we look to that with all those unknown factors, it's very hard for me to say, Matthew, that it's just stop and steady growth from here. It might be stronger growth from here. And that makes it hard to predict gross margins because as we grow those CPAP and APAP numbers so well in the U.S. geography, it's incredible great revenue and cloud connected and links us with the patient for life, but it is lower gross margin than our group. And so it's great gross profit dollars, but has an impact on our gross margin as you saw that steady apart from FX moving it down 30 basis points. So a complex equation but I'd say it's at minimum, it stays where it is and grows with the market but it could potentially grow above that as we continue to take share and solidify that share through our digital ecosystem. Thanks for the question, Matthew. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow-up first on the competitive dynamic to the extent that you'll -- you see anything maybe into the -- in the marketplace. So whether your key competitor is coming back either approaching or maybe hiring processes, marketing campaigns, anything that maybe they're gearing up for that you're seeing or is demand relatively similar to what you've seen in the past, no real changes. Thank you. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Margaret, and welcome back. Yes. I think it's difficult to predict exactly where they're at from those sort of the early emerging signs, as you say. Look, we have regional competitors in Europe that we are fighting with every day there. We have regional competitors in Asia that we're fighting with every day and regional competitors in the Americas that we're fighting with every day. When Philips comes back, they'll have to start at position number four, if you like, in new patient setups. We are -- they are back and we are competing with them in some countries in Europe, like in Spain, they never went away because they never had a phone device there. So they've been there the whole time through this recall, and we've been beating them handsomely there. And as other markets in Europe where they've started to come back, we are competing and winning and maintaining share and growing share. I think the reputation here and the time to market is going to be a very slow progress for them country by country whether or not they get a consent decree in the largest geography. And so we look at it going forward and say, look, do we have enough supply to take care of all the market demands between us and the other regional players? And we finally got there where I can say that this quarter that we're there and we can take care of it. So it's almost irrelevant to us how and when in terms of what that looks like because we're able to take care of all the market growth. So for us, it sort of takes away that uncertainty and allows us to push forward. But yes, we're competing head-to-head with them in some many countries in Asia and some countries in Europe. And it's like -- it wasn't 2019 where our smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more digital solutions are taking share and holding share. And it's an ongoing competitive game. And as I said, we're launching some of these AI driven products on top of this ecosystem. It's an exponential game when you think about digital and we're well ahead. We've had two or three years here to sprint ahead. We were ahead before that. And I think it's a long-term game won't get -- we'll keep productively paranoid, but we are improving outcomes, we're lowering costs and the physicians like the workflow efficiencies and patients like the increased adherence and payers like the fact that there's an ROI in lowering total healthcare costs. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live. Anthony Petrone : Great. Thank you. Congrats on a shrunk top-line here, share gains. Maybe two part question. Mick, one would be just on the amount of resupply that's now coming in as it relates to the share gains that you've seen over the past two years, is the resupply number we're seeing now where we actually starting to see consumables come off of the new sockets that you gained. So that would be question one. And then question two, there's obviously the debate out there on GLP-1s, maybe from the perspective of ResMed, how do you see the GLP-1 phenomenon playing out in the sleep space, specifically do you expect to gain more patients from GLP-1s versus maybe certain patients that would fall out of the funnel? Thanks again. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Anthony, and welcome back to you too to the ResMed following us here. I'll take yes, both of your question and your follow-up in order. So firstly on resupply, as you know, you've been following us for a number of years. It's not a lock and key. You can use our mask on other devices and you can use other masks on our devices. The way that we've won market share and nobody's been on a major in terms of not being able to sell recall out there on this. And so we've had head-to-head competition with all the top five players in masks, these last three years and we've gained really good share with that. So I think it's just the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the minimalist size ones, the ones that have full freedom and the ones that have the ability to for the front sleepers and side sleepers to provide that, that capability. And so that's how we've gained share in the mask side and maintained that share. So I -- there is a better together in that when you have an AirSense 10 or an AirSense 11, the mask leak data are more accurate. The interoperability of an AHI calculation or a leak calculation are more accurate. So we certainly push that angle and we do get some extra share for through the device, but it's not as material as the fact that the masks themselves are just excellent, which I think speaks to the sustainability there. So that strong resupply, as you said, 19% growth in the U.S., 14% growth in Europe, Asia and beyond, where we don't have that sort of automated resupply that we have with Brightree ReSupply Solutions in the U.S. that's been from hard work from our teams in Asia, Latin America, and Europe on patient outreach, subscription programs and connecting directly to that end user. So I think post-COVID people care about respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and taking care of themselves outside the hospital, and we've been able to leverage that trend in the consumer side as well. So I think it's sustainable, and I don't think although it may be catalyzed somewhat by our increased device share, I think our market share is on its own extraordinary and due to the intrinsic products. The second question around GLPs, yes, look, there's a lot of moving parts. I was just reading in the press today that many U.S. employers are banning coverage of GLP-1s due to cost. European governments have all said no from the government insurance side. These things are incredibly expensive about $1,000, well, anywhere from $800 to $1,200, $1,000 a month. So I think there are three factors that'll mitigate GLPs in the space. One is cost, two is adherence, and three is side effects. I'll take them really quickly in order. If you look at cost, take a 40-year old person who's on therapy full time for 40 years, 40 times, 12 times a $1,000 is $480,000 lifetime cost for that patient on a GLP-1 from 40 to 80 lifetime cost. If you take that same patient and say, look, let's treat them with CPAP, right? First year maybe a $1,000, and then 39 years of let's take a really strong case where you get four masks a year and they're all full face masks. That's about thirteen and a half thousand dollars. So it's 35 times more expensive to go with a GLP-1. It's just like what's the ROI here, that's cost. On adherence, the data out there are about 33% adherence at one year through the clinical trials on GLP-1s. That's incredibly low. We get 87% adherence at 90 days, and we hold it pretty strong there. So I think adherence is a big deal. And third is side effects. Reading thyroid, pancreas, kidney, these cancer, these major side effects and minor ones like nausea, constipation, and pain. Our biggest side effect as President Biden had a little mark on his face and he was asked about it, and it was from his CPAP. Look, I think it's a long road to play out here. I think it's frankly good marketing around the area of obesity and it can drive patients into the funnel. But I don't think it's going to be a major impact on patients because we've got 936 million of them worldwide and we need them to get into the funnel. If they come in the funnel because they tried a pill and it didn't work. That's good for us too. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Shaymus Contorno : Hi, this is Shaymus on for Suraj. So we saw gross margin set down a little bit. I know you said there was some reasonings for it, but I just looking forward kind of in the future, maybe you can walk us through the temporary and more structurally permanent changes we should think through as far as GM outlook is concerned. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question and you look and it's a good one. Lots of factors going on gross margin, actually, the major one that as you noticed sequentially on the 30 basis points was foreign exchange and that was on inventory as it flowed through our funnel as we sold those CPAPs, APAPs we had, FX that had impacted them, six, nine months ago, but they're flowing through inventory that we sold during the June quarter. That was the headwind of 30 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We -- look, I think there's so many moving parts, but when you add it up and you look at geography mix and the upside opportunity for us to grow our business in Europe, Asia, particularly Japan, which has some chance for acceleration over the coming years, product mix, I mentioned in the prep remarks, particularly on bi-level and our non-invasive ventilator growth. So think AirCurve ST, FTI, AirCurve ASV, these are in -- and our masks side, particularly the full face, but any of the masks, all of those are gross margin accretive to our group. And I see opportunities for strong growth in all those categories. And also our software solutions have gross margin accretive capabilities and as we go on an organic basis from single-digits to high-single-digits to low doubles there on the software SaaS side of the business, I think that's margin accretive. So I feel good about that. I also know that we are working through the sort of higher inventory costs that we had in that supply chain crisis, we had to spend more on chips, parts and pieces and those contracts and get more expensive components for the cloud connective chip and beyond. And those freight costs that we invested in and everyone's talking all the news, the freight costs are down, you should take away your surcharge. Well, no, actually the freight costs that we paid six, nine months ago are working there with through -- way through our gross margin, as you saw in the June quarter. And that'll go on for some time, but that's going to continue to go down over time and as that does go through our sole products, there's going to be some tailwinds for gross margin. And the final one and really important one is we're going to drive AirSense 11. It's the best in the world product. It's better than the second best product in the world, which is the AirSense 10. And it gives us a chance as we gain regulatory approvals and we scale that production to improve our gross margins there as well. So all those are tailwinds for the gross and net margin of the business as we move through the fiscal year. Hard to predict in that one of the main factors is, how do we accelerate in the U.S. and particularly in CPAP, APAP. I will never turn down a patient if there's demand for a patient and they want an CPAP and APAP, I'm not going to reverse engineer and we know how to do it. We could reverse engineer our gross margin up 30, 50 basis points by slowing down sales of product. We're not going to do that when a patient needs care. We're going to take care of them even if it's a slightly lower gross margin. And by the way, it is very good gross profit dollars, and we get to take that cash flow as you saw a really strong cash flow in the quarter and reinvest it in R&D. So we're working on all the above furiously and we're going to get success as we go over the next one, two, three, and four quarters. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Your line is now live. Laura Sutcliffe : Hello, thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk about how your position to increase your mask supply in the event that the consent decree over at the competition impacts their ability to provide those, for example, if they end up constrained at a facility level. Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Look, we have run all sorts of scenario analyses around that. I think one of the differences if you think in terms of ResMed's ability to work with suppliers in the core device side, where in terms of chip sets, the whole med-tech sector as a group, and I serve on the Board of AdvaMed and we were advocating for more semiconductor chips for the whole industry. When we were going to Intel, TI and all these companies and sort of begging for semiconductor chips 12, 18 months ago, all together we were less than 1% of the supply of chips. And it was very difficult. We did get some, and as you saw, we did have to pay a little more, but we were able to get those contracts with other players and get long-term contracts and get that supply. In the field of medical grade silicon rubber, we are one of the top users in the world for this. As you know, we sell tens of millions of mask products per year. And we are an incredibly large part of that supply chain. So if a competitor was not able to sell masks, their demand for that LSR would go down and those or similar suppliers would then want to keep their factories operating and be looking for other suppliers. And we would be running the game theory and the analysis of where we go and how we go to ramp that production up. So it would be a good problem to have for the business. I think it'd be bad problem to have for patients, but I think the probability of that is relatively low, but if it does happen, we're ready. But Rob, do you have any thoughts on that? Rob Douglas, our President and COO. Rob Douglas : Yes. Hi, just one other minor comment on that. And we've said this before, because of the relatively low CapEx of our supply chain and the equipment that we need, we generally run with quite a lot of those capacity supply. And so our ability to rapidly increase volumes as needed is really strong. Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Sean Laaman : Good afternoon. Mick, hope you're well. Mick, I'm wondering if you could characterize for us some of the price dynamics that might have been present during the quarter. Mick Farrell : Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. Yes, a simple question, very complex answer across the 140 countries and all the dynamics. I think one thing that I'm comfortable to say though on this is that if you look over the last four quarters, our commercial teams have done an incredible job of partnering up with our customers to say, look, inflation is up, costs are up. How do we share some of the pain, if you like, of these increased costs? And we were able to increase some prices on some mask systems and components and some devices where we could, it's tough because customers often don't get much relief from the payers. They did in the Medicare side in the U.S. market where there was an inflation adjustment up of around 5% January 1. And so that was a benefit for our providers, and so we could share some of the pain there in terms of increased pricing. But we've also had some surcharges on our products in terms of freight. And although, as I said in the prep remarks, we've seen all the news media that freight costs are all down. Well, yes, okay, they are on a spot price, but 12 months ago or nine months ago, as that works through our inventory, that freight charge is still there and is still impacting our costs. And inflation, although coming down is still high. But I think our commercial teams have done a really good job of partnering up with our customers, walking them through the situation, the reality that costs are up, inflation's up, freights up, inventory costs are up. We need to work on appropriate pricing to make that happen. And we've had some appreciation in average selling price over these last 12 months. And we'll look to do over the next 12 months to do an appropriate pricing with customers on a per customer per contract basis to sort of share some of the pain of the increased cost that our industry is having. But at the same time, we're laser-focused on driving that growth. And so it's a really strong sort of price elasticity, it's a question of how do we make sure we get that balance right? But it's a competitive game. Some of our competitors are out there saying the same thing publicly, that costs are up. And so we need to move prices appropriately. And we are out there working with customers to make sure that we as an industry take care of patients in a sustainable economic way, and that that involves both quantity, price, and supply over the long-term. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Yes. Good morning, Mick. Can I ask a question about outlook? So through the earlier -- early quarters you mentioned that we were going to see sequential revenue growth through 2023, and we have seen that, and that's been fabulous. But with your competitor -- key competitor out of the market, do you still expect to grow revenue sequentially into first quarter, second quarter 2024 or for however long as they remain out of the market? Mick Farrell : Yes. So great question, Lyanne. And yes, 12 months ago, when it was pretty clear that we had a strong runway there on the devices side, and we -- it was really, we were constrained by our own production. I was able to very strongly say, look, I am confident that our supply chain team has got access to this re-engineering, redesign, and redeployment of key components, particularly electronic components, particularly semiconductors. And we did that and we grew device revenue every quarter throughout fiscal year 2023, as you noted. I was really excited with the team on that. As we look forward to fiscal year 2024, we don't give guidance really on the top-line. Brett's given some really solid guidance on our SG&A, our R&D, our effective tax rate and how we're looking in those parts of the business that are very controllable. As I said in some of the earlier questions, Lyanne, there's so many moving factors in overall demand in the market. But look, I'm confident because new patients continue to come into the funnel, right? That's happening across the world, and it's not happening randomly. We're driving demand gen programs; we're driving them in Australia, New Zealand with our Awaken Your Best campaign. We're driving them through our German teams, our India teams, social media programs in our China team, this really strong social media demand gen. And so we're getting new patients in the funnel. And there was a lot of patients who couldn't get a replenishment device when their device hit three years or five years or whatever time their insurance allows, or they as a consumer decide that they want to get to the next-gen product. And I think the AirSense 11 and all its features, it's engagement with the patient, with compliance coach, and its ability to engage with them directly on the touchscreen has driven some demand as well. So all that together make me confident that over the fiscal year, we're going to have strong demand. But as you go from Q4 to Q1, there's a seasonal impact. The Northern European and U.S. markets take summer vacations, and these have impacts seasonally on the business. And so traditionally, Q4 to Q1 isn't one up. I'm not giving guidance for it, but traditionally, that's the way it happens. We are not -- we are no longer supply constrained. We are back to a demand environment. And then there's the factor of that number four competitor probably not coming back during the next 60 days through. So the end of this 90-day period, but I'm not going to jump in and predict on that. All I'm going to say is we're out there all day every day, driving demand gen of new patients in, we're out there farming for patients who need to get a replacement device. And every day we're engaging with patients on myAir and reminding them of the importance of a clean hygiene and a new mask and engagement with their digital apps. So all the above gives me very strong confidence for high growth of ResMed throughout the year. But I'm not going to call it on an every 90 day basis here. We just don't do that on the top-line. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Chris Cooper : Good morning -- afternoon. Thank you. So Mick on AirSense 11, you sort of emphasized its importance for gross margin. You also said at the start of the call, you sort of expect this to remain on allocation for a few more quarters yet, I know this timeframe was probably a bit longer than you'd hoped. I just wanted to confirm whether that's entirely a function of supply chain at this point, or I guess whether there's any sort of strategic consideration to manage volumes during such an unusual competitive dynamic. Mick Farrell : Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. We've really been focused on that patient and making sure no one's left behind. As I said in an earlier question, and although the AirSense 11 is better margin for us, and it's better innovation and it has a higher engagement on the myAir app, which drives engagement, adherence, mass resupply and everything. Our view is that if there's a patient available and we have the parts and pieces and the ability to make an AirSense 10 take care of that demand now while we ramp AirSense 11, we're going to do it and we're going to take care of that patient. By the way, there's some really strong upside for that patient in that the alternative is a competitor device, which would not be as small, quite, comfortable and connected. And so they'd have a much worse experience than the AirSense 10 with a competitive one. So it's better for the patient. It is slightly low margin for us, but we get that patient on therapy, and there is the better together with ResMed that it's more likely, hopefully, that they get a ResMed mask and that they use that mask for the rest of their life. And so I think there's an overlap there, if you like of altruism and the profit motive to do the right thing on a gross profit, cash flow driven environment. And we're not going to manage just to a GM line and say, well, let's not do that and make those products. And so it's less I mean, it's strategic in this way that our brand is about patient care. Our brand is about taking care of someone who's suffocating and getting them out of hospital and doing that. And if we have to do it with an AirSense 10, which is an amazing seven-year old platform, then we're going to do it. If we can do it with the brand new AirSense 11 platform, we're going to do it. And look, nothing's slowing us down. Our quality and regulatory teams are going geography by geography to get the AirSense 11 approved in each of the regulatory environments. So as soon as that is, we can start selling the products. But the ramp up on AirSense 11 is probably not as fast as it would be in a market where you had all five major competitors competing there because of that excess demand we're covering a lot of that with the AirSense 10. So that's sort of how we're thinking about it. Patient-centric, patient demand, take care of that patient now, get them on our ecosystem, and then ramp as fast as we can AirSense 11, and we're doing that. Nothing's slowing down. The accelerator is firmly pedal to the floor on AirSense 11. And so everyone we make, we sell but it will be on allocation just given the huge demand that we see in the market right now, Chris. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST. Your line is now live. Dan Hurren : Hi, good morning, and thanks very much. Mick, at the third quarter result, you seem to be very confident about gross margin. In fact, I think at the time we know that it was probably the most positive gross margin commentary we'd heard out of ResMed in recent memory. So I know you've spoken to component cost and why you don't manage the gross margin, but what else changed since the time you gave that, that commentary to the result? Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question. And I think actually if you go back and look, the all the factors that I talked about 90 days ago, we're talking about today, but in addition, the AirSense 11 ramp that we're putting together there. What happened in these 90 days that was unpredicted was -- there was more demand. What we thought a competitor may be back, and there was more demand for CPAPs and APAPs and we didn't -- I know the exact number of how we could have slowed down our AirSense 10 generation to get gross margin to be plus 30 basis points from QtoQ, but we didn't engineer it and reverse engineer it that way. We said, there's demand out there, let's go take care of those patients. That was the unexpected factor. It was U.S. CPAP and APAP demand. And I mean, you look through the numbers, you'll see that it was incredibly strong on gross profit generation, cash flow generation, incredibly strong during the quarter. And we did think about it. Oh gosh, do we follow through and saying, oh, we want to get accretive GM, 90-day to 90-day point or do we say take care of that patient? And we said, no, we're going to do the right thing. We're going to take care of the patient. So we're thinking about the long-term here. But no, I'm still bullish over this fiscal year for sure. I -- you never can know what demand's going to look like and where it's at and we are not going to not take care of a patient. But as those higher inventory costs work their way through our system there's opportunity for gross margin improvement as we go forward. There's also the impact of if you looked at the SG&A this time a year ago in the June quarter of 2022 versus 2023, there was still a lot of people on that sort of COVID. I'm not traveling, I'm not going to see customers, I'm not going to do the strategic meetings and the planning meetings. We've opened some of that up, as you saw in our SG&A and so that's impacting our net margin as well. We're going to manage those tightly and carefully. And we'll probably have some further vigilance, if you like, on our SG&A and we won't be pulling back really on R&D. I think that the innovation engine has to continue to grow, and we're doubling down on AI, and I think our leadership and digital health, we have to make that happen. So I'm still bullish throughout the fiscal year of FY2024. But we're not going to not take care of a patient if there's excess demand with a CPAP and APAP to manage one component of the P&L versus taking care of the patients and thinking about the one, three, five-year strategic engagement with the patient, with the physician, with the provider, and doing the right thing for the industry. So that's the sort of factors that have changed in the next 90 days. And I hope actually all this comes together and we continue to do both, right, drive the needs of the patient and be able to get accretion in our GM. And I'm very confident we'll do that over the coming 3, 6, 9, 12 months. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live. David Low : Thanks very much. Mick, could I get to comment a little on what you saw in the ex-U.S. market? Obviously last quarter we saw the big event sale ventilator sales into China. Just wondering if there's any countries you'd call out or any items we should be aware of, please. Mick Farrell : Yes, David, that's a good point. We didn't really see anything of material context in this quarter in terms of exacerbation of COVID that that led to hospital based or life support ventilator sales. And so we're back to I would say some steady growth that we see in our neuromuscular disease, our COPD and other sort of respiratory insufficiency parts of our business for life support vents. On the non-invasive vents and adaptive server vents and bi-levels, we're back to steady market growth and actually we saw strong double-digit growth as those post-COVID, we're starting to see the clinics open up and patient flows start to come back. Rob, any thoughts on ventilators? Rob Douglas : No. Not on ventilators, because I'm just going to comment on masks. Mick Farrell : Yes. Rob Douglas : So the masks in all these other markets were really strong and really it's showing underlying strength of the market not affected by recall dynamics or anything like that. So really the whole patient diagnostic systems are working in order and everything's going strongly. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now line. Steve Wheen : Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask Brett about the working capital position. Again, last quarter we were -- you were thinking that you'd be able to make some inroads into those -- into the inventory balances that you had such that we might see a bit of more of the release of cash, but obviously inventory stepped up again as has the receivables. Is that just building more to the demand that you see? Or could you just help put that into a bit more context as why it didn't quite play out the way you thought? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Hi, Steve. It's Brett. The inventory actually came down a little bit sequentially, so that, that's sort of tracking down how we're expecting. We expect that inventory balance should decline over the course of FY024 as well. The receivables you're right was up a little bit, but that's really driven by the revenues. I think overall in the working capital, we're in pretty good shape. It was up a little bit this quarter. When you look at that, we -- it's really the timing around tax payments this quarter. So we paid higher tax this quarter than we would typically do each quarter. So that's that drive, if you like, a little bit of negative working capital. But again, that's just a timing element. So we're expecting pretty robust cash flow generation through each of the quarters in FY2024. And we'll continue to work hard on the working capital and bringing that down. A big driver of that will obviously be the inventory and working that down progressively over the fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham and Company. Your line is now live. Joseph Conway : Hi guys, this is Joseph on for Mike. Could you maybe talk about the new patient and REPAP backlog internationally? I guess the way that I understand it is it's fully worked through in the U.S. but there's still work to do internationally. I don't know if you -- if that's the case and if you could size that at all. Mick Farrell : Yes. Look, I don't think we've fully worked through the backlog of patients in the U.S. in terms of patients who want to get whose insurance has got to the five-year point if their Medicare or three, four, five depending on which private payer they're under. And so I do think our competitors' actions slowed down that, that particularly if they're on a competitive device and the demand limitation and the physician saying, look, I've got to take care of new patients. They weren't as prone to write prescriptions or to allocate REPAP, if you like, for patients. So I actually think there's some runways still left on REPAP within the U.S. geography, and I think that's even more so in other markets. As Rob just noted and as we talked about the engagement with consumers and patients in different geographies is driving mass growth and any quarter that have 14% revenue growth in masks in Europe, Asia, rest of the world would be incredible. And that's not driven by any recall dynamics whatsoever from a competitor. Everybody's been competing in masks globally. And so I think that speaks to our ability to hopefully have a sustainable approach to REPAP not only in the U.S. where we have incredibly strong relationships with Brightree and myAir directly to patients, directly to providers but the ecosystems that we are generating in some of our other sort of omni-channel markets around the world. So I think the opportunity for REPAP in the U.S. is still there over this fiscal year and beyond, and to make it a rhythm, right? So it becomes a steady part of the growth of the devices and to drive it. I think there's even more opportunity in the other parts of the world leveraging the work we've done on the mask side to then remind patients and track them when they're at that three, four, five-year time period to pull forward. Now I want to be there with the appropriate supply, so I'm not jumping ahead of ourselves, but we do have the programs and capabilities to do that, but I think the demand is there inherently. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Good morning, Mick, and good day, Brett and Rob. Just wondering on masks, it's been a while since we've seen some new product coming out from ResMed. Just wondering how much has the recall -- better recall impacted on your ability to continue to focus on new product development and new product launch? And I guess on the mask side, should we expect anything for near-term in terms of a refresh of the mask portfolio? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yes. So it's a great question and yes, our R&D team, have obviously been incredibly focused on the re-engineering, the resupply and the redesign on our core device platforms, and we're able to do that, right? So we're able to get the supply back of Air 10s, as you saw, and Air 11s. But yet, look, I -- we had the whole board down in Sydney last quarter, and we were looking through the pipeline of devices and masks and it's incredible. It's really exciting. I don't like to get ahead of my commercial teams, and one of them is at the table with me now telling me to keep quiet. But I can tell you I'm very excited about the pipeline. There will be new innovation, new masks from ResMed as we go through this fiscal year. And as a personal user of these products, I try every new mask that comes out and this new one, which has a great project name that I'm not able to say, but it's a beautiful island that you can travel to by boats. I have tried that that mask and it's incredible and I can't wait for that to come to the market. But yes, look, we do have masks that are coming in the pipeline that are working their way through regulatory and then of course, commercial ramp up to make sure that when we deliver, it's ResMed quality, ResMed capability, first time fit, incredible adherence, and to drive through the channel. And so you'll see those come through our major markets and then globally throughout the fiscal year. So I'm excited about that pipeline. The one that I can talk about is the digital side, where we've launched an AI product and I'm really excited as those get more traction, we'll talk about how the digital products and the mass products throughout the year are going to impact and keep our incredibly strong double-digit growth that we saw this quarter. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments. Mick Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining us this last hour as we talked through our results. And we'll talk to you again in 90 days. In closing, I want to thank the 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are shareholders and listen to these calls as well, thanks for your dedication and hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better, live better lives in 140 countries. These results are yours, incredible double-digit growth. Thanks for all that you do. I'll hand the call back to you Amy to close this out. Amy Wakeham : Awesome. Thank you, Mick, and thanks, everyone. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our ResMed's fourth quarter 2023 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close the call. Operator : Thank you. You may now disconnect. We do thank you for your participation today.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone. Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal Year 2024. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site later today along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer, to answer any questions you may have. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong growth across our entire business with double digit top line growth. This growth was driven by double digit global growth in the masks category and double digit growth in our software as a service business. We also achieved high single digit global growth in devices even as that category annualizes very high growth in the prior year period. The flexible and agile work of our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution teams has enabled us to provide ongoing global availability of our market leading 100% cloud connectable flow generator platforms. We have unconstrained supply of our AirSense platforms enabled by excellent volumes of the AirSense 10 platform globally and fast ramping approvals, launches and delivery of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform country by country. During the quarter, we accelerated delivery of the AirSense 11 in Japan, and we launched the AirSense 11 in Australia and New Zealand. We have plenty of runway ahead on our pathway to launch in all of the 140 countries where we sell our solutions. We are very proud to be able to support all global demand for flow generators through a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. We remain laser focused on accelerating the production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform. We are moving swiftly on that front. Our Masks and Accessories business grew 21% year-over-year, amongst a highly competitive market with all global players on the field in this category. Our commercial teams are doing an amazing job of showing the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. Our clinical and commercial teams are also partnering with physicians and provider customers to drive resupply programs directly with patients. The peer reviewed and published clinical evidence showing that adoption of a resupply program leads to better patient outcomes is proving itself out in the real world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the US mask business where provider resupply programs can scale, powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians and providers and myAir for patients. For patients around the world, especially in nonreimbursed markets, we are developing, launching and scaling outreach and subscription programs to help the consumer who is the ultimate customer to take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their mask, tubing, humidifier and other accessories. This has been a permanent uptick since COVID-19. People care about respiratory health and respiratory hygiene and they are taking action, and we are supporting them with digital solutions and services to meet their needs. Before I turn to review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to spend a little time discussing actions we've taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long term success. We've taken immediate steps to ensure we're prioritizing the right things to drive profitable growth and our leadership teams have carefully reviewed opportunities to improve our performance. We have stopped some projects that were not working out as well as we thought. We've increased investment in areas that we believe will be pivotal to long term success, such as our digital health tech investments as well as focused hardware and software development. Creating the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected and the most intelligent healthcare solutions in the market. These changes have impacted some of our teams. And this week, we have taken actions that resulted in a reduction of our global workforce by 5%. Decisions like this that impact people are never easy. However, we know that we are doing the right thing, and we're doing the right thing to accelerate our growth and to refocus on our long term mission. I feel more strongly than ever that we are well positioned with an incredibly long runway of profitable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders as we move forward. Let's now turn to a discussion of our three key strategic priorities : number one, to grow and differentiate our core Sleep Apnea and Respiratory Care business; number two, to design, develop and deliver market leading medical technology as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease and insomnia. There are millions more that we can support as they navigate the complex outside hospital healthcare system. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. We have a massive opportunity ahead of us to help hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Our end markets remain incredibly underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. Now that we've been able to comfortably support overall global market demand for sleep devices for the last few quarters, we're ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We're investing in marketing efforts to raise awareness and patient engagement across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional healthcare channels as well as investing in cost effective direct-to-consumer demand gen campaigns to help what we call sleep concern consumers, find their way into the screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathway. We will act as a digital concierge to guide patients on that journey. In terms of analyzing the results of these efforts to date and ongoing, we are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider based ecosystem, AirView, which now has more than 22.5 million patients, as well as the new user starts in myAir where patients themselves choose to participate in their personalized healthcare journey to better breathing and better sleep. Patient flow into the funnel is at an all time high. We are well above the rates that we saw pre-COVID in 2019 across all geographies, triple digits across the board. The bottom line is that we are driving strong growth of patients into the funnel. We believe the work that's being done in the pharmaceutical industry right now with obesity drugs will be a net positive for patient flow and patient growth in sleep apnea, COPD and for ResMed overall. In terms of existing patients in our installed base, we are actively tracking a cohort of many thousands of patients on these GLP-1 medications and LPAT therapy. We are not seeing any significant change in the PAP adherence rates nor any reduced participation in resupply programs versus control groups. These data indicate that there is a cohort of patients on combined therapies in a stable state. In terms of new patients activated into the funnel, we are seeing the number of new patients activated into the healthcare funnel picking up. We see patient flow is not only strong but increasing. We believe in treating the whole person here at ResMed, including a combination of cardiovascular exercise, diet and nutrition as well as good sleep and breathing. That combination was called the Triumvirate of Health by Professor Bill Dement from Stanford, may he rest in peace. And we think a combination of these three elements will result in the best outcomes for patients. It is quite possible that this new class of drugs may become as large or even larger than the cholesterol class or the blood pressure treatment class of pharmaceuticals. If this is the case, we will see a whole new population of patients activated with their primary care providers that we may never have seen in the healthcare system. If this comes to pass, we may see benefits for the entire health system and for the people being treated themselves and for ResMed, as more and more people are evaluated and screened for sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency and other key chronic conditions as part of their primary care evaluations. Our data are showing an all time high of patient flow and that supports this thesis. Stepping back and looking at the science in the field of respiratory medicine, we have created a forward-looking epidemiology model for our core market sleep apnea, spanning over two to three decades into the future. We have assumed an aggressive case for high market penetration of this new class of pharmaceuticals. We will publish the epidemiology model in our investor deck straight after this call. The model starts using a baseline of the global prevalence of sleep apnea, which was 936 million people in 2015. And this is based on peer reviewed and published data from the Journal Lancet in 2019. Our epidemiology model grows with conservative population and aging assumptions to a prevalence of around 1.4 billion people suffering from sleep apnea in 2050. We then overlaid an aggressive assumption for the adoption of this new pharmaceutical class globally. We assumed some of the highest penetration rates that we have seen reported by analysts in the industry. With this aggressive and sustained adoption of the new drug class, we forecast that the global prevalence of sleep apnea will still be around 1.2 billion people in 2050. Now in terms of the market penetration of our PAP therapy into this population, we have assumed market growth from our 22.5 million patients with PAP therapy here at the end of calendar year 2023 using steady state market growth rates that we saw in the years leading up to 2019, that is mid single digit growth for devices and high single digit growth for masks. With these growth rates, we reached around 109 million patients on our PAP therapy by 2050. That leaves 1.1 billion people remaining in the addressable market in 2050, over and above those already on our PAP treatment. We will continue to update our epidemiology model with all the new data as they arise. However, the bottom line is that there remains a huge number of people needing our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next two to three decades and beyond. While we're proud that we have peer reviewed and published data showing that we can achieve over 87% adherence of patients to our PAP technology, combining our best-in-class med tech hardware with our digital health solutions AirView and myAir, that still means 10% of our patients on an annual basis will need alternatives. We are investing in those alternative therapies, and we are actively working with direct -- to direct patients who do not adhere to pack that 10%-plus to second line therapies, such as dental devices, where we have invested and scaled the market leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called [Narval]. In addition, we have investments in other second line therapies, including pharmaceuticals and hypoglossal nerve stem technology. We want every patient who suffocates at night to find a path to good breathing and good sleep, and it looks like there's 1 billion of them we need to help. We start with the highest efficacy and lowest cost therapy, which is PAP technology, where we have very high adherence rates and the best outcomes for patients and we go from there. Given this incredible multiple decades long plus runway of growth and as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline that end-to-end patient pathway and to make it easier for sleep physicians and sleep labs to diagnose and manage these patients, we're excited about our Somnoware acquisition that we closed during the last quarter. Somnoware is software for pulmonary and really all sleep physicians. And it complements our current portfolio of software offerings for physicians, homecare providers and patients, including AirView, Brightree and myAir, respectively. The goal is to ultimately drive greater efficiency and better patient care by helping physicians to take best-in-class care of their patients with increased efficiency and a better overall experience for the doctor and for the patient. We're making progress across several digital health technology initiatives to drive the value proposition of our cloud connected devices even higher. We are investing in several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities in our Air Solutions ecosystem. This quarter, we started rolling out a digital product in our US market called Compliance Coach. Compliance Coach is built for home care providers to help them efficiently focus efforts and prioritize outreach to increase patient compliance and ultimately to drive better patient outcomes by helping them meet and beat 90-day adherence goals. The application utilizes ResMed's many billions of nights of de-identified sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud to predict the likelihood that a patient will be adherent to therapy or not. The AI product then advises and coaches the home care provider to best identify the patients who may struggle and to meet compliance requirements where they can so they can prioritize their interventions and outreach to the best probabilities to support patient success. It's early in our rollout program of Compliance Coach. However, customers using the product are excited and engaged and are starting to see results. Watch this space for many more ways that we can work with all of our customers to unlock value from incredible depth of de-identified data using tech like AI and ML for the ultimate benefit of physicians, providers and patients. Let me discuss the forward pathway stemming from our joint venture with Verily right now that was called Primasun. Based on a mutual agreement between ResMed and Verily, we've made the decision to unwind the joint venture's day-to-day operations. We expect this to be complete by the end of the current quarter. Over the past years of this partnership, we've learned how to leverage technology to better identify, engage, diagnose and manage sleep concern consumers in our US market. We expect to take ownership of key assets of the Primasun developed model so that we can build on the investment and the learnings and ultimately accelerate our ongoing demand generation efforts with sleep apnea patients across ResMed. It is exciting to take the learning from demand gen work in one project and in one country and to now look to apply that on a global scale across the 140 countries where we provide solutions. Our growing Respiratory Care business continues to be supported by the increased adoption of both noninvasive and life support ventilator solutions. In terms of next-gen respiratory care therapies, we continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy, that we call HFT, with the goal of cost effectively treating COPD in the home. We continue to generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that we believe will support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We believe this has the potential for future growth for ResMed over the medium to long term. We remain focused on addressing COPD as one of the top three chronic diseases for hospitalization and the number one cause of rehospitalization. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focusing and developing and plan to offer low cost, high quality solutions to address this healthcare epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 32%. SaaS business growth was powered by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business in Germany, as well as high single-digit organic growth across our Brightree and MatrixCare brands in the US market. The sustained high single digit organic growth in our SaaS business is driven by strength in the HME segment and stability as well as increased tech adoption by customers in the facilities segment. We see a pathway to stable double digit organic growth across the SaaS business, as well as increased net operating profit performance from this part of our business. The ongoing synergies between our digital health solutions in SaaS and our core business remains strong, and we continue to leverage that through combined management of cloud compute, cyber security, interoperability, tech dev as well as customer facing synergies, including patient resupply technology in our core business. During the quarter, we appointed Greg Timmons as the new General Manager of our Brightree business. I'm excited to support Greg and Bobby to continue to drive growth in our home medical equipment providers and to help our customers across the US market. This quarter, I traveled to Hildesheim, Germany to meet in person with the entire team from our MEDIFOX DAN business. The growth in tech solutions for ambulant home nursing as well as stationary nursing home businesses is very strong in Germany with an aging population in that country and a government that is driving care to be more home based through their policies and more digital through their policies. We see a long runway for growth with our MEDIFOX DAN team and across our global software as a service business. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions we have in our respiratory medicine business. And we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. And we have created differentiated value for customers and will drive long term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Before we get into a detailed update on our financials, let me say this here at ResMed. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology across our markets. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations, we will leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive profitable growth. We're focused on driving top line revenue and tight cost discipline as well as increased efficiencies so that we can accelerate profitability, delivering value for all of our stakeholders and especially the 2 billion patients plus worldwide who need our help. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I'm confident on laser focus that we will continue to see improvements in our gross margin with GM leverage programs focused on five key areas. Number one, to drive the launch of AirSense 11 into new global markets and to increase the availability of AirSense 11 ultimately in all the country markets that we serve. Number two, to drive ongoing strong mask growth with a combination of resupply programs, subscription programs and new product launches, and you can see that's working this quarter. Number three, to increase software solutions growth, moving from high single digit organic growth to double digit organic growth with increased net operating profit leverage in that segment. Number four, to move the higher cost components and freight costs that we've seen through our legacy through our P&L, turning what was a supply chain crisis headwind into a steady tailwind as we move through fiscal year 2024. And number five, to implement cost reduction actions in noncore areas of our business to free up cash and to accelerate investments in market leading medtech and digital health solutions. So in terms of Digital Health Investments and Solutions, we now have over 16 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and over 22.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold in more than 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health technology and we don't plan to stop anytime soon. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. ResMed's mission and key goal remain crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates ResMed-ians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 165 million lives with the delivery of a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live high quality lives with best in class healthcare delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the 10,000 ResMed-ians for their perseverance, their hard work, their dedication, both today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney. And after Brett's remarks, we will open up for Q&A from the entire group. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1. Group revenue for the September quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand as well as strong growth across our mask product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $10 million in the September quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries increased by 10%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 18%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 21%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 2%, which reflects the fact that we are cycling a particularly higher prior year comparable that was driven by sales of our card to cloud devices. Masks and other sales increased by 23%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 20% in constant currency terms, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices [Technical Difficulty] these patient setups. Software as a service revenue increased by 32% in the September quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the September quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $25.7 million for the September quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note, we will anniversary this acquisition in Q2 FY24, so our headline SaaS growth rate will moderate in Q2. Turning to my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers where we\u2019ve provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 160 basis points to 56% in the September quarter. The decrease primarily reflects an increase in component and manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix due to the increase in mask growth relative to device growth and favorable foreign currency movements. Sequential gross margin improved by 20 basis points, driven primarily by favorable product mix. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 15% or in constant currency terms increased by 14%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with the MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 20.2% compared to the 20.3% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year '24. This guidance also reflects the impact of restructuring we initiated earlier this week and we estimate this will result in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5%. We expect to complete the restructure during our second quarter of fiscal year '24. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 20% or in constant currency terms increased by 21%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to the 6.6% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '24. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 10%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million per quarter over the balance of fiscal year '24. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.1%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '24 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the September quarter increased by 9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64 also increased by 9%. During the quarter, we recorded a provision of $8 million associated with the expected cost of the recently announced Astral field safety notification. We also recorded acquisition related expenses of $0.5 million during the quarter. These both have been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q1 financial results. We recorded losses of $4.5 million in our September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. As Mick discussed, the joint venture will be winding down operations and we will incur no further losses going forward in relation to Primasun. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $286 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million and depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $209 million, and at September 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $80 million. At September 30, we had approximately $825 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. During the quarter, we also closed our previously announced Somnoware acquisition, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As part of our capital management activities, we plan to resume our previously authorized share buyback program starting in our second quarter. We expect to purchase shares to the value of approximately $50 million per quarter. This will more than offset any dilution from the issue of employee equity during the year. Finally, concurrent with our capital management activities, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and turn the call back over to you to remind participants about instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. David Bailey : Mick, I'd just like to press a bit more on some of the comments around the market to 2050. Just interested in your thoughts around GLP-1s as potentially being complementary to CPAP as opposed to being a substitution for. And maybe just giving some thoughts around the upcoming clinical trials and how that could influence that will take going forward? Mick Farrell : And I'm just happy that we've had 90 days and we put some sites behind the analysis of this as the world leader in the field of respiratory medicine and sleep apnea, we really know these prevalence numbers really well. And so that baseline of 936 million patients from 2015, growing to 1.4 billion through 2050 is really, I think, pretty conservative in its assumption of the growth rate of populations and aging populations in lower growth areas. But what that shows is 1.4 billion available in that time, not including any impact from any of these GLP-1 class of drug. And we took really the maximum aggressive efforts, including all current indications and some future ones to assess what the impact could be on the potential of patients in terms of sleep apnea prevalence worldwide, really aggressive and assume not only aggressive penetration but sustained that the adherence rate would stay sort of 80% to 100% on these drugs, which they're not achieving out there in the market, but we just said, let's take that high penetration case and that showed 1.2 billion patients in 2050. And so we will look at every update that comes from the pharma industry. They're very active in this class of GLP-1 but we think we're taking a very high penetration analysis to get there. And so we'll continue to look at any new data that come on and every quarter, we'll update that epidemiology model and move it around. But what it shows is a huge opportunity, 1.1 billion patients above our penetration at quite high growth rates through the next number of decades. To your question around concomitant therapy and use what we've been seeing in the last two years since a number of these have been out there in the diabetes side and on the obese indications, it's obviously early days, but we're tracking many thousands of patients on GLP-1s and PAP and we're seeing maintenance of adherence, we're seeing maintenance of resupply programs and really no change. When you look at -- so that\u2019s at the aggregate level, we are seeing no change there. We are seeing more patients coming into the funnel. Look, we know we're doing our awareness programs, our demand gen programs and there are other alternative therapies doing demand gen that bring patients into the funnel that we get a benefit from. But we truly believe that this idea that you could come in to the healthcare system, someone who's maybe obese, moderately obese and likely avoiding the healthcare system, there's a high avoidance of people with BMI of 30, 32, 35 of the primary care system. And so we believe it will bring more patients in. We're seeing that with our very high patient flow. So look, we're just looking at the data we're observing, which is patients on concomitant therapies there multiple years, and we're going to track those and track the adherence and we'll publish that every quarter. We're seeing actually our adherence rates steady and resupply rates steady in that installed base. And in the new patient flow side, we're actually seeing increased all-time highs of patients coming into the funnel. So we're watching all of these above and we're looking for two to three decades and still see with highest case penetration, you can roll in any study like you're still going to see north of hundreds of millions to 1 billion patients between the likely penetration in our disease state and beyond. But David, thanks for the question, and I look forward to ongoing discussions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. David Low : If I could stick on the same topic. Mick, could I get you to talk a little bit to the 22.5 million patients that you've got on myAir? It would be really good to understand how they sort of fit into the categories of mild, moderate and severe sleep apnea. Because as much as you've given us some very big numbers, we're fully aware that about half of those patients are in the mild category. And it's unclear to me that many of those patients are currently seeking treatment or will seek treatment in future. So if you could just help us with what you can see in the data and so we can make an assessment as well, please. Mick Farrell : Yes, David, look, thanks for the question. And as you look at the epidemiology data, there's a number of splits on AHI. What we're lacking in the market is a split around symptomatology and how patients feel. And as we're looking at the data, patients with AHIs, 5 to 15, 15 to 30 and 30 plus and overlapping that with concomitant therapy, we'll be peer reviewing and publishing data at upcoming conferences in 2024 on this to show some of these nuances of deltas. But on the aggregate group, we're not seeing changes in adherence. And even in the subsets of mild to moderate, we're not seeing significant changes in adherence rates or new patients coming into the funnel. AHI is a great measure of the number of suffocation episodes per hour. Just to remind people, an AHI 14, just under 15, which is considered mild is suffocating every four minutes of sleep. So a doctor may call that mild, but to a patient who's suffocating every four minutes of sleep, in 15 -- 14 times an hour, and you're sleeping all through the not having 80, 90 suffocation episodes, they stick on the therapy and new patients coming in as well. So look, we're watching this really carefully, and we're really analyzing by AHI, by symptomatology, by craniofacial distance between the tongue and the uvula and actually size of time because there's a whole lot of factors that go into go into the prevalence of sleep apnea and obviously, the issues around hypopneas, which are far more prevalent in women and lead to worse excessive daytime sleepiness, headache and comorbidities that are not associated with weight at all. But look, we're looking through all of these data. And as we look forward over the next number of decades, there will be an impact. There's no question by these weight loss medications. But it will be on the margin and it won't be -- I mean, certainly, the market believes it's going to be dramatic given the last 90 days of our stock. And I can tell you, every bit of clinical data that we have going forward and every bit we have going retrospectively, we've got the biggest database in the world and it's 21.5 million patients. As we look at that split between mild, moderate and severe, we're not seeing changes. But look, every quarter, we'll continue to update that, and we'll do more and more splits on severity. We published this epidemiology model this quarter and we'll continue to update it and continue to provide data. I'm also making sure that we keep some of those data so we can get them into the peer reviewed and published press like the Lancet article that started the epidemiology model, and so we'll be publishing the information that we can. And then every quarter here on the -- on our investor site, but they will also be running the real sites in epidemiology models and health econ and outcomes research work and making sure that gets into the peer reviewed and published press as well. Operator : Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST. Dan Hurren : I was going to ask some questions about the results rather than GLP-1 drugs, if that's okay? Mick Farrell : Dan, that would be delightful. Dan Hurren : Look, just a question for Brett. Could you walk us -- can you just walk us through the headwinds and tailwinds for gross margin over the balance of FY24. And maybe we're seeing some pricing increases out there in the market and product mix shifting around. Could you just perhaps walk through those factors? Brett Sandercock : As we look forward on GM, I mean, Mick mentioned it in his remarks as well. But if you look at it in terms of GM, we do feel that we're going to see improvements in our gross margin over FY24. And those tailwinds are really going to be around improved product mix, manufacturing improvements and efficiencies that we think we can drive. Freight cost reductions are still making their way through inventory and some of that will manifest in FY24. We're seeing stabilized component costs now, that was a headwind even for this quarter but we're cycling, largely cycling that, particularly in the second half FY '24. And then we have, obviously, the AS10 to AS11 transition that will be progressive over FY24 as well and then your point mentioning a little bit around pricing as well. So a combination of those factors will give us confidence, I think, in the gross margin through FY24. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Chris Cooper : Sorry come back to it, guys, but I think it is an important topic. So just on the patient data mix that you're tracking CPAP patients also in GLP-1s. Can you just update us on how many patients you're tracking there, and when you intend on publishing that? I know Rob foreshadowed last month that you would be sort of releasing that data? Would it make sense to do that before, or do you think maybe after the major study that's going to read out next year? And just any high level thoughts you have on the outcome of that study would be helpful at this stage. Mick Farrell : And so yes, there will be ongoing longitudinal studies that will get out to the peer-reviewed press, but obviously, look, it's an urgent issue. And if you look at the market reaction the last 90 days, there's an assumption of 30%, 40% reduction in immediate TAM, right? If you look at that market cap change and it's just in congress with every piece of scientific evidence that we've looked at historically and going forward. So there's many thousands of patients on our GLP-1 plus PAP database. We also have 17,000 patients that we're tracking that have had gone through bariatric surgery and are on PAP therapy post surgery with 50%-plus weight loss reductions in that cohort. So we're tracking much stronger weight loss cohort and this sort of -- depending on which type of GLP-1, 10, 20, 30, plus percent weight loss reductions in the extreme case of the 50% weight loss reductions. And so we'll be are publishing data in the peer reviewed and clinical press across all of those cohorts as we go forward. Yes, we will choose -- as we keep putting out the epidemiology data, we will choose to put some of those data, which aren't going into the peer-reviewed press, right? So we don't those studies that we actually want to get into the clinical information that can really be out there versus just the stuff that we put together for an investor, which then would prohibit those same data going into a clinical paper. But we are finding the balance between those and we definitely hear that the market is looking for those data. I can tell you now that the data on aggregate are showing no change despite how you look which GLP-1 class, which AHI group for adherence and resupply. But I will start to find the right division between the information we can get out on the short to medium term basis and the information that needs to go in those longitudinal studies to really show the sites behind this and really balance it out. One of the best ways we're doing it every quarter is to show the incredible growth that we're getting in our devices and our masks and particularly the resupply of masks, right? There's no impact of anyone's recall, there's no impact of any drug therapy and you just look at the replenishment rate of masks, if you're not on therapy, you're not ordering masks. And we're seeing really strong resupply. The other fact to bring into this that we can publish and do publish is the number of patients in our Air Solutions ecosystem, 22.5 million patients that continues to go up. We had record numbers of new patients starting up. And in addition to that record numbers of patients themselves engaging with myAir and that's driven by AirSense 11 being far more digitally engaged and higher rates of adoption of that. But we're seeing a really strong uptake of patients and flow in and patients on adherence, but we'll continue to publish every quarter those data and the appropriate data we can from the clinical, and we'll definitely update the epidemiology model every quarter. Operator : Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Craig Wong-Pan: Just on your Americas mask growth, could you provide some more details on where that additional growth in resupply has been coming from, and how long do you think you can sustain that strong year-on-year growth in mask revenues? Mick Farrell : It's a really good question because the mask growth across the group was 21% on constant currency. Europe was incredibly strong at 15% constant currency growth in a full competition market with everybody on the field and 23% in US, Canada, Latin America. Look, as I said in my description in the prepared remarks on our look forward over the next n number of decades, the stable market growth in our field was mid single digits on the device side and high single digits on the mask side. If you look at the five year CAGR, three year CAGR leading into 2019 pre COVID. And that's sort of what we're looking at that epidemiology model that mid single digit growth on devices and high single digit growth on masks. So if you think of that as the market growth in a stable state, it then comes up to, well, what can ResMed do in market demand? What can we do in demand gen? What can we do to get patients into the funnel? I truly believe to the three questions focused on this new class of drugs. I do believe we are seeing more patients come into the funnel, more patients into primary care. That's great. I mean I think there's $1 trillion worth of market cap now from these companies and they will turn that into marketing to bring people in for the miracle drug, and that will absolutely bring patients in for assessment for all the comorbidities that are associated with a patient that might have been severely overweight and now likely on the other side of these will still be overweight, including sleep apnea, COPD and other cardiovascular diseases and beyond. So we're watching that really closely. Look, we've consistently over decades that we've been in business, not just accepted mask growth rates from the market, we said, let's drive it higher and higher. The 23% is extraordinary and very strong in a highly competitive market. But I look at what we're doing with resupply, I look at what we're doing with new product launches, I look at what we're doing to drive patients into the funnel. And I think we can meet and beat that high single digits that the market would grow at. And with us being such a strong share, we get to -- when we do demand gen, we get to get a very good share of those patients through the funnel. So there's more of an incentive for ResMed to drive demand gen initiatives when we get such a good share of it on the device and mask side, and we're seeing that in many of the markets we operate in worldwide. But it's a great question. Operator : Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Sean Laaman : Mick, really good OpEx control in the quarter. And I think Brett mentioned, if I pick it up correctly, 18% to 20% as a guide on revenue going forward. I'm just wondering if there is more restructuring to done or to be done or you think you're rightsized at the moment? Mick Farrell : And as I said in the prepared remarks, stuff that impacts our people are the toughest decisions to make, and we did this week, have a change in 5% of our global workforce reduction of 5% of our global workforce and tough decisions to make. I really think that, that is -- if you think about it, that is the restructuring. There are some changes I'm looking at it in the operating model, sort and roles and responsibilities and a focus on a more product-led and brand-led company that will come over time, but they're not massive restructures. And I think what that 18% to 20% revenues that Brett talked about in SG&A is indicative of the change that we've made here and reestablished a new base and a push for, as you said, really strong profitable growth across our business. But look, the world has changed. We are already a product led organization but our brand has increased in its value across the world, and we need to document and understand that and understand how to engage people in nonreimbursed markets as consumers into the funnel. And we've already invested in a number of our D2C markets in that, and we're driving that. And in our B2B and B2B2C markets, we're also working with our healthcare partners and distributors in the channel to work out how to best get patients into the funnel. So we're sort of, if you like, we're freeing up cash to reinvest in demand gen, reinvest in getting patients into the funnel. And we think there's a billion reasons in terms of the patients that need our help to get out there and do it. And that's going to be there for decades and we've got to find better ways to do it. But to answer your question directly, yes, that restructure is done and we're now focused on moving forward. Operator : Your next question is coming from Margarette Kaczor from William Blair. Margarette Kaczor : I wanted to focus on the quarter as well. You guys talked about this all time high patient flow number, which is notable. When you said the channel, I guess, were you referencing those are CPAP prescriptions or folks getting tests? And any color you can give us on how that growth profile compared to recent quarters, and anything kind of on the US device growth this quarter as well? Mick Farrell : So look, we have a relatively low share of the diagnostic space in home sleep apnea testing with our ApneaLink Air product. So we are tracking that,those are up. The best data we have is through Air Solutions System. So we talk about the 22.5 million patients on our Air Solutions platform and almost 7 million patients that we now have on myAir patients directly engaged in. So we watch those starts very closely. We also do have de-identified and objective data from Brightree showing across the whole industry, patients coming into the funnel in sleep apnea but also across other home medical equipment categories. And I can tell you the patients are getting engaged and finding their way into the to the primary care treatment funnel and specifically in sleep apnea. And we believe it's not short term that this is a sustainable rate of growth for patients coming in, and I think it's really exciting to see that. To your question specifically about device growth, yes, so it's 8% globally. I mean I got to say I'm incredibly proud of our Europe, Asia and rest of world markets growing 20% this quarter year-on-year, that's where we're competing directly with our competitor that was out for their recall. They're back in many countries, in Europe, Asia and rest of world, and meeting and beating them head-to-head, I think, proves out the thesis that ResMed has the best-in-class products, but services and solutions, not just the hardware but the software and the capability we've been investing in that for a long period of time. This period a year ago, the September quarter 2022, we had just unleashed card to cloud on an unallocated basis, and it took off despite usually what is quite a low growth quarter in September, given that summer here in the US. We had incredible growth last summer with our card to cloud solutions, so we're lapping that growth. I think the team with that device growth of 2% is building on what was an extraordinary uptick from card to cloud. But when we look at the number of patients coming through, the diagnostic funnel and the setups coming into AirView and the setups of the patients coming into myAir, the growth rate of patients is mid single digits plus and with recap really up there. And so I think that's why I can say that I think it's sustainable for us to meet and beat sort of the pre-COVID 2019 earlier CAGR of mid single digit growth for devices, we can meet and beat that throughout demand gen and high single digit growth in masks. We can definitely meet and beat that through our work and experience and expertise now on resupply, engagement with patients and the changes that happen during COVID are focused on respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. So I hope that answers your question, Margaret. Thanks to that. Operator : Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Steve Wheen : Just a question back on to the gross margin. When we think about fourth quarter's growth margin, it went down largely because of FX and mix and yet we've got that going in your favor in this quarter. I'm just curious as to really what is holding that gross margin back when you do have such a strong mix geographically with devices in rest of world up but also masks as a category overall up and you've got the FX tailwind as well? And just to clarify, the Astral field safety notice cost is not in the 56% gross margin from what I can work out, if that's correct as well? Brett Sandercock : Yes, that's correct, that's excluded as a non-GAAP item from 56%. But if you're talking year-on-year on the gross margin, really the biggest impact coming through was component cost increases that we're still cycling through and working through inventory. So that was the biggest factor. We did see some product mix favorability there, but not enough to offset those component cost increases, for example. That was the biggest impact on the year-on-year reduction in GM. Operator : Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Saul Hadassin : Mick, you've kind of commented on sustainability of US flow gen growth. I just wanted to ask you, so the growth rate based on revenues this quarter implies about a 17% CAGR going back to 1Q fiscal '20, so the September '19 quarter. So I'm just wondering if you think you can sustain sort of the dollars of flow gen sales that you reported this quarter, or if you think sales are going to step down as we work through the rest of fiscal '24? Just wondering if you can sustain the level of sales in dollar terms? Mick Farrell : It's a good question, but it's a complicated answer, because there's so many moving pieces between that baseline you took there for that CAGR number '19 and '20 with the COVID shutdowns, our spin-up on ventilators with 150,000 vents at the start 2020 and then the slowdown and the restart-up of the sleep apnea funnel and the shift that happened through 2020, 2021. And then, of course, the perturbation that made it a perfect storm of a competitor with a recall of 5.5 million devices and '21 through '23 and ongoing. So with all that, I'll just talk to the market growth rate that we saw stable pre-2019, right, of that mid single digit growth of devices and high single digit growth in masks. We think that where we're at now taking our baseline of now we can meet and beat that growth rate, right? And so that definitely doesn't mean going backwards. You can take what we've got now, which is, I believe, a very strong share of the US market and in the 140 countries we're in competition, but it's a good place for us to be. We are looking at from where we are achieving mid single digit plus growth in our devices and high single-digit growth on our masks. And no, we don't intend to go backwards at all. In fact, we intend to not only go forward but go forward strongly. And I think what was shown up in the numbers this quarter is our incredibly strong growth. I talked earlier that our incredibly strong growth in devices of 20% in Europe, Asia and rest of world. We had 15% growth in masks in Europe, Asia and around the other countries. And so I think what it's shown is that ResMed is going to go head-to-head with full competition out there and be able to meet and beat the competition, because we've got the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and the most intelligent health systems, and it's that whole combination of not just the product, but the solution, the service and how it's embedded in the healthcare system to the patient to the physician that allows us to achieve that. So we're not going backwards, we're going forward, Saul, and we're going to grow at or ahead of market. And in many countries, we're going to drive demand gen to increase the whole aggregate market growth rate and pull more patients into the funnel, because now we've got a greater incentive than ever to do that. Thanks for the question. Operator : The next question is coming from Matthew Chevrier from Citi. Matthew Chevrier : One on SaaS, please. So what will drive the SaaS revenue to now grow double digits from high single digit previously? Mick Farrell : Thanks for the question, Matthew, and welcome to covering ResMed. Yes. So look, what's going to happen is with our organic SaaS business, as you saw in the quarter, we had good high single-digit growth at 7%. And we've sort of been in that sort of 7% to 8% in our organic growth across our US franchise really MatrixCare plus Brightree. And with the MEDIFOX DAN group, we haven't sort of been breaking out organic growth within that. But it is going to be incremental to that group. But in addition to that, there's a great product pipeline at both Brightree and MatrixCare that I feel confident and some portfolio focuses on the high growth parts of their portfolio and moving out or backing up with some of the low growth areas in that portfolio of MatrixCare that gives me great confidence as I look forward over the fiscal year and beyond that we're going to turn organic growth from sort of where it is now in the high single digits to double double digit growth on a stable organic basis across that SaaS business. So Matthew, it's a combination of MEDIFOX DAN increase in the group but also some great product pipelines in the current business to be able to get us there. And the final punchline I'll put there is, in addition to that, driving that better top line growth, we're working -- we restructured as well on SG&A and some R&D in our SaaS business this week, this quarter. And that will allow us to get good leverage on the net operating profit bottom line. And I see that moving closer and closer to the ResMed group and even being a strong contributor, an even stronger contributor for us as we look to maximize our long term EPS and return on invested capital across our group. So great question, Matthew, but we're very confident we can achieve that as we go through fiscal year '24, '25 and beyond in our SaaS business. Operator : We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments. Mick Farrell : Well, thanks, everybody, for attending this call and for the great detailed questions. And thanks, Kevin. Yes. Look, I'll close with this. ResMed is well positioned for ongoing future success and accelerated profitable growth. We're taking actions to prioritize on the right initiatives and we're optimizing costs to fuel our long term growth. The opportunity in front of us is huge and largely untapped and it's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the healthcare system every quarter and we'll benefit and help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. And we'll keep proving it to you every quarter as we go forward. Thanks to all the 10,000 ResMed-ians, many of whom are also shareholders, for all that you do today and every day. And with that, I'll hand the call back to you, Amy, to close us out. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. As always, if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. This does conclude ResMed's first quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, you can now end the call. Operator : Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Amy Wakeham. Please go ahead, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2024. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, both of these are now available. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is non-intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP reported numbers. In addition to our discussion today, it will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn our call over to ResMed's CEO, Mick Farrell. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our second quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong execution across our entire business, driving double-digit top and bottom line growth. These results are a testament to the incredible efforts of the global ResMed team. Our results were driven by double-digit global growth in both devices and our Software-as-a-Service business together with high single-digit global growth in our masks and accessories business, holding our leading market share amongst high comps from the same quarter a year ago. In terms of bottom line leverage, our reorganization efforts and efficiency efforts in the quarter have set us on a clear trajectory of profitable growth. Taking a step back, all 10,000 ResMedians are energized about the opportunities in front of us. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease or insomnia. These chronic conditions form a healthcare epidemic in which ResMed is uniquely positioned to help. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest security and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. Our end markets remain underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. We support hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their healthcare journey and navigate the complex healthcare world outside the hospital system. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 17 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear market leader in sleep apnea, a huge and growing market with over 1 billion people impacted globally. Our category-leading flow generator platforms grew 11% year-over-year. We have achieved and are maintaining supply of our two 100% connectable AirSense platforms, with unconstrained supply of the AirSense 10 platform globally. Every quarter, we continue to gain regulatory approvals to launch and to increase delivery volumes of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform on our pathway to support more and more patients worldwide. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. During the quarter, our masks and accessories business grew 9% year-over-year in a highly competitive market, maintaining good market share with all players in the field in this category globally. We are excited to have achieved regulatory and reimbursement approval for our latest and greatest mask innovation and we look forward to bringing this technology to market soon. I have personally worn this new mask and our test data show, not just n equals one from the CEO, that it is highly favored by physicians, respiratory therapists and especially the most important customer, our patients. In terms of maintaining our momentum of mask and accessory growth, our clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients. Peer-reviewed and published clinical evidence shows that using resupply programs leads to better patient adherence and to better patient outcomes. This is proving out in the real-world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the U.S. mask and accessories business, where resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, Brightree for home care medical equipment providers and myAir for patients. Outside the U.S., we are focused on developing, launching and scaling our direct outreach and subscription programs, to help consumers take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their own mask, their own tubing, their own humidifier and other accessories. The importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene in the eyes of consumers has seen a permanent uptick since four years ago when the COVID-19 epidemic started. We are supporting our customers with digital solutions and services to meet their needs and to ensure they have clean and fresh equipment to best treat their sleep suffocation and improve their health. Before I review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to discuss recent actions we have taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long-term success. Last quarter, I discussed the steps we've taken to ensure that we can refocus and drive even more profitable growth. We stopped some projects that were not working out and we increased investment in areas that will be pivotal to our long-term success, including our digital health technology investments as well as focused device platform and mask technology development. We have introduced a new operating model centered on making ResMed even more product-led, even more customer-centric and even more brand enhanced. We will measure the success of this new 2030 operating model by an increase in the velocity of new product innovation as well as enhanced value in the ResMed brand while accelerating profitable growth. As the founder of ResMed states, innovation is not just invention of a great new technology is when a customer loves it, adopts it and chooses to pay for it. We have an incredible legacy and an exciting product pipeline to bring to market. Let's now turn to a discussion of our three key strategic priorities. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design and develop and deliver market-leading med tech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 countries plus worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in the home. In terms of addressing strategic priority, number one, as the world's clear leader in the field of sleep apnea and breathing health, we are laser-focused in 2024 on ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We are raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for sleep suffocation across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional healthcare channels and investing in cost-effective social media-driven demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their own sleep and breathing to find their way into screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways. Our goal is to provide a digital healthcare concierge service to help guide people on that journey. We are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, which now contains more than 26 million patient records as well as the new user starts in myAir, which is a patient app where patients choose to participate in their own personalized healthcare journey to better sleep and better breathing. Our goal is to cost effectively drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help into the channel. There are two megatrends that can have an influence on increasing that patient flow, one from big consumer tech and one from Big Pharma. Let me talk briefly about each of these megatrends. Many of the big consumer tech companies are increasing their focus on the area of sleep wellness. Apple has sleep wellness tracking built into its latest-generation Apple Watch and has plans to enhance that capability with further sleep quality assessment. Google's Fitbit division has sleep wellness tracking built into its platform. WHOOP is doing the same. Samsung have not only built sleep wellness tracking into its latest operating platform, but is helping to define sleep personas to help consumers better understand a 30% of their lives they spend in the state of sleep. We love this attention on the field of sleep wellness and many of these technologies will help each person find out if they have issues with sleep architecture, issues with breathing during sleep, or issues maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep apnea or they have insomnia, well, maybe they have both, a state that is called COMISA for co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnea. Ultimately, this will lead to increasing patient growth for ResMed overall. And our goal is to best educate the person as they move from sleep wellness tracking to sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness into a true healthcare pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their chronic condition. ResMed plans to be there with the person through that entire journey. In terms of the impact of megatrends from Big Pharma, the current focus is squarely on GLP-1 medications. Let me take some time to address what we are seeing in the market with patients on latest-generation GLP-1 therapies and positive airway pressure therapy. We are tracking a cohort of over 0.5 million patients with prescriptions for both GLP-1 medications and positive airway pressure therapy. These data are included in our investor deck, so you can review them there on our website, but I'll briefly summarize what we have observed. Around six months ago, there was a thought among some in the market that patients on GLP-1 medications would be less likely to start positive airway pressure therapy. We stated at the time and still do, that this was not likely the case as important risk factors such as craniofacial geometry, gender, age and the basic physics and anatomy of the upper airway would remain unchanged despite this new pharmaceutical therapy option. Still, the theory remained. So now we have real-world data and real-world evidence at scale. Our analysis of over 529,000 patients with GLP-1 prescriptions shows that not only is there not a reduction in the propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy, it is the exact opposite. For patients who have been prescribed a GLP-1, there is an increase of 10% of the absolute percentage of patients that commence positive airway pressure therapy. So as an example, if you take a baseline of 75% of patients that commence PAP therapy after their prescription on average in a certain group, that would become 85% of those same patients who were on a GLP-1 that would commence positive airway pressure therapy. And by the way, the vast, vast majority of these GLP-1s are the latest generation medications. Another hypothesis about six months ago was that patients on GLP-1 therapy and PAP therapy would quit their PAP therapy, their CPAP or their APAP at a higher rate than the general population over time. The real world data, again, with a cohort of over 0.5 million patients shows the exact opposite. At T equals 12 months after therapy commencement on PAP, the delta from general PAP population to a PAP plus GLP-1 prescribed population shows an increase in the resupply rate of 300 basis points. So again, as an example, if the general population resupply rate at 12 months was, say, 70%, it would then become 73% for the population that was prescribed to both PAP and GLP-1 therapy. This delta actually increases over time going further with the delta from the general PAP population receiving resupply at 12 months being 500 basis points higher for a population prescribed both PAP and GLP-1s. Here at ResMed, we believe in treating the whole person, including a combination of what Professor Bill Dement, one of the founders of the field of sleep medicine, may he rest in peace, called the Triumvirate of Health. That triumvirate is one, regular cardiovascular exercise; two, balanced diet and nutrition; and three, good sleep and breathing. We believe that addressing all three aspects results in the best patient outcomes. In terms of best-in-class treatment for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published research demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients adherent to our PAP technology by combining our market-leading device platforms with digital health solutions, including AirView for physicians and myAir for patients. Even with this best-in-class global technology, we still have more than 10% of patients that need alternatives. We just can't get them adherent those 10%. We are investing in these alternative therapies and we are working to help patients who do not adhere to positive airway pressure to find their path to second-tier therapies, such as dental devices where ResMed has invested and scaled the market-leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called Narval. In addition, we have investments in other third-tier therapies, including pharmaceutical agents with our Apnimed investment as well as hypoglossal nerve stimulation technology with our Nyxoah investment. ResMed stands for respiratory medicine, not CPAP company, and we want to take care of the patient. We obviously start with the lowest cost, highest efficacy therapies, including CPAP, APAP and bilevel therapies. And we then work through the alternatives to help the person sleep better and breathe better. The bottom line is this, a huge number of people need our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next decade, two decades, three decades and beyond. We want every patient to find a path to good breathing and good sleep. Let's pivot for a moment to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging the 17 billion nights of de-identified medical data and the 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable devices in our ecosystem. We are investing in several artificial intelligence-driven data products and capabilities in that ecosystem that we call Air Solutions. We are continuing to roll out, one publicly we are talking about, which is called Compliance Coach to customers in the U.S. market in a controlled market launch. Compliance Coach is a solution that helps home medical equipment providers to prioritize both digital and personal outreach to improve patient compliance and drive better patient outcomes at a lower cost. Compliance Coach models and predict the likelihood that a particular patient will or will not adhere to therapy based on algorithms built on billions of data points. The AI product then identifies for the HME provider, the key patients who may struggle to meet compliance requirements and takes a step further to drive digital and/or human actions to maximize the probability of adherence across the group. Customers using the product in its initial launch are excited and are starting to see very positive results across their business and for their patients. One final update on AI technology for this quarter. We recently launched an in-market trial of a ResMed developed generative AI product that serves as a digital concierge to help a group of people that we call sleep-concerned consumers, to best navigate as they search for their sleep-related information and they ask questions about their sleep wellness and potential treatment options. This generative AI tool helps the person identify, engage and enroll on their personal journey to better sleep and better breathing. We are currently beta test marking this product in Asia Pacific, and we will look to scale globally over time. Our goal is to develop and scale this digital sleep concierge so that all those seeking better sleep and better breathing can find their personal pathway for the best outcome, the best treatment and the best long-term care. Our Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our non-invasive ventilator platforms as well as our life support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy that we call HFT to even more cost effectively treat COPD in the home. As we develop these next-generation therapies, we will generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that will support broader adoption of these innovations for treating respiratory conditions at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase, and we offer low-cost, high-quality treatments to help address this healthcare epidemic. Turning to our Residential Care Software-as-a-Service business. We had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 24%. Organic growth of our SaaS business was solid across our Brightree and our MatrixCare brands with another full quarter contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN brand in Germany. Ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our home medical equipment resupply revenue remains very strong, driving good growth across both our SaaS business and our core sleep health business. We expect to have sustainable organic growth across our portfolio of SaaS solutions in home medical equipment, home health, home nursing and beyond to be in the high-single digits as we continue through this fiscal year and to achieve stable double-digit organic growth through fiscal year 2025 and beyond. We continue to drive operating expense leverage through management of our capabilities for cloud compute, our capabilities for cybersecurity, interoperability and technology development and we plan to accelerate net operating profit growth across our SaaS portfolio and across the entire ResMed business. Our residential care SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market-leading software and the market-leading device solutions that we have in our sleep health and breathing health business, and we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential care. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We are focused on driving topline revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and we don't plan to stop innovating anytime soon. We invest around 7% of our revenues straight back into market-leading research and development. ResMed's mission remains crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission motivates me and ResMedians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 170 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient. We've helped each person to sleep better, to breathe better or to live higher-quality lives with best-in-class healthcare delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us and the pipeline we have ahead. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A for Brett and me and the team. Over to you, Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue for the December quarter was $1.16 billion, a 12% headline increase and 11% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand and continued growth across our mask portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $11 million in the December quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12%. Globally, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, masks and other sales increased by 10%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 16%, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices. Mask and other sales increased by 4%, reflecting the impact of a strong prior year comparable growth rate. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 24% in the December quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 10% in the December quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $28 million in the December quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note as we have now passed the first year anniversary of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, our future SaaS revenue year-over-year will reflect organic growth. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 10 basis points to 56.9% in the December quarter. The increase primarily reflects a decrease in freight costs and increase in average selling prices and favorable foreign currency movements. The benefits are partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Sequential gross margin increased by 90 basis points, primarily driven by a reduction in freight costs and an increase in average selling prices for our devices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. We remain confident of a positive gross margin trajectory. Like many companies, we are monitoring potential headwinds that could arise in the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea will likely increase sea freight costs and shipping lead times. We're closely tracking the situation and taking action to mitigate potential impacts where we can. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 4%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.1% compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and cost discipline following specific actions taken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. This guidance reflects the impact of our restructuring activities that resulted in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5% during the quarter. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 6%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.4% compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 20%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and modest growth in our operating expenses. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter was $14 million. And as we continue to pay down debt, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 20.7% compared to 18.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a significant reduction in the tax benefit associated with employee equity compensation this quarter compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. During the quarter, we recorded $64.2 million of restructuring-related charges following an evaluation of our existing operations and actions undertaken to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability. Restructuring charges included $28.6 million of employee severance and other onetime termination benefits, $33.2 million of intangible asset impairments associated with the wind down of certain business activities and $2.4 million of other asset impairments. The restructure charge has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. During the quarter, we also recorded a provision of $6.4 million for expected costs associated with the recently announced Masks with magnets field safety notification. This expense has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $273 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and relatively stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $23 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $210 million. On December 31, we have $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $130 million. On December 31, we had approximately $955 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As we advised last quarter, as part of our capital management activities, we resumed our previously authorized share buyback program in the December quarter. We purchased 335,000 shares for consideration of $50 million. We intend to continue to purchase approximately $50 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Let's go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of our call. Kevin, I'd like to turn it over to you to provide the instructions and then run this part of the call. Operator : Certainly, we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Margaret Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live. We do ask you ask limit yourselves to one question please. Margaret Andrew : Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Good morning to everyone on the call. I wanted to maybe follow-up on your comments on GLP-1, even more so than the quarter. And I look at that 10% greater likelihood of folks starting CPAP when you're on a GLP, it seems like it could have a pretty meaningful impact for growth. And again, looking at it to say, if you're going from 75 patient new starts in a given period to 85, that's a 13% bigger market every year. So I guess conceptually, is that something that you agree with? Would it have a greater or less benefit impact if that trend continues? And I guess any comments on a real impact is over the next three years as GLP adoption grows? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Yes, Margaret. Look, it's a great question. And as a biomedical engineer, I look at this, and I don't know causality, I just know the correlation. And so we've now got data, the 529,000 data points that show that there's a 10% higher propensity to start PAP therapy if you prescribe the GLP-1 before and then you get the PAP therapy, 10 absolute percentage points higher of the cohort will start PAP therapy. My thought is that this is a more motivated patient, a more engaged patient in the health care system, and they've been brought in by this new therapeutic tool. And so I do think that it will lead to greater growth. This megatrend of GLP-1s will lead to greater growth of patients coming into our treatment pool over time. And certainly, the data is showing that with that cohort of patients. Yes, your quick math there of an increase, I think, is that if there's full penetration across the whole patient cohort and full adoption GLP-1s across every patient coming through. Of course, that's the maximum state. But I think realistically, as we see this pretty fast rollout of this new pharmaceutical class, we will start to see more patients come into the health care system. Everyone is seeing that across medtech and across health care. They are more engaged and they do seem to be getting prescriptions for many different chronic diseases. Sleep apnea is non-exception. And we've got probably one of the highest number of patients in that cohort of over 0.5 million patients that we're tracking. And of course, we've got 26 million patients in our database. So this is a minority of patients that we're seeing on these, but it is interesting within that cohort to see a higher participation rate. Look, our goal will be to leverage that megatrend and to make sure that ResMed is there with the best tools for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. And we've done that over decades, and we plan to do it ahead. I think maybe the consumer big tech trend of sleep wellness tracking might be slightly higher in its impact over time, maybe not as quick adoption, but these sleep wellness tools come across all consumer tech applications is incredibly exciting. ResMed's goal is there to leverage this demand gen that's coming to us from Big Pharma and big consumer tech, but then more importantly, to get that personalized health journey so that ResMed can be truly the concierge for that person if they find their path to better sleep and better health. So we do expect these trends to be positive. They won't be immediate. And our job is to drive it over time. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live. Anthony Petrone : Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on a good quarter here. Maybe Mick will stay on GLP-1s, we're getting a lot of attention turning toward the Eli Lilly SURMOUNT-OSA study. And maybe the KPIs that you're looking for in that study how relevant do you think the primary endpoint is? Are there other secondary endpoints that are more important? And do you think over time you can collaborate with Lilly to drive the effort of using CPAP with the GLP-1? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And it's a really pertinent one. Certainly, we're watching this SURMOUNT-OSA trial. It's a pretty small trial. It's less than 500 patients, 500, 600 patients, I believe. So it's not sort of the order of the real world event, real-world data that we have, like 500,000 patients we're talking about there. But I think it will be very interesting to see the presumption is given it's the same biochemical compound as in other trials used for diabetes treatment and weight loss that it will have somewhere in the order of 10%, 20%, maybe even 30% weight loss reduction in this cohort. So that's a metric that's sort of well-known from prior studies. The best evidence from the primary investigator on this Professor Atul Malhotra from University of California, San Diego. His assessment is that, that should lead to pretty significant AHI reductions in the treatment cohort versus placebo, maybe in the order of to maybe 65% AHI reductions in the cohort of these quite high BMI and quite high AHI patients. If you listen to a great podcast between Professor Malhotra and Dr. Carlos Nunez, our Chief Medical Officer, which are available on our website. When you've got to spare 45 minutes, but there are some cliff notes that I think are worth sharing here in this investor call is that Professor Malhotra was asked what's the best therapy to treat sleep apnea. Is it, a, weight loss? Or is it b, CPAP. And he said, \"Well, that's a false dichotomy, this question, it's a false competition. It's a plus b. It has been for decades and will be for decades in the future. And as a PI on that study, he says, look, we have a new pharmaceutical agent that's going to help with treatment a. And of course, that will be used in combination with treatment B. So the PI on the study is saying that he thinks the combination treatment of a weight loss medication similar to prior work and bariatric surgery that had much higher weight loss numbers or diet and exercise that had all the variance that we've seen over decades of different methodologies there. But this one does seem to be a good agent for treatment a. And then will need to be combined with treatment b to fully treat the sleep suffocation that the patients will have. So don't trust me, the CEO of the company that makes the therapeutic, trust the primary investigator that's saying, combination treatment has worked for decades and will work for decades. I would expect that to be the outcome the trial. And in terms of working with Big Pharma on this, I think they're very focused on other areas like obesity and diabetes, but as much as we can get their attention to talk about sleep and sleep health and to do their D2P advertising to talk about the importance of sleep and sleep health. I think combined with the Apples and the Samsungs and the Googles of the world talking about it, it will be a huge positive for of us in the sleep apnea treatment industry. Thanks for the question, Anthony. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Michael Matson : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll just ask one on Philips. So I think they've talked about relaunching their flow generators in some of the OUS markets, just curious what you're seeing there? Have you seen that happening? And have they been able to recapture share anywhere? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And yes, certainly in tens of countries in Europe and Asia. We are in full competition with all the global players, including the company you mentioned and the large regionals from Europe and from Asia and have been for many quarters. So they've come back in masks and devices across tens of countries in Europe and Asia. And their goal there when they come back, if they've been out for a year or two, depending on the time they're out of each market is to fight their way from the bottom. They've got zero percent new patient start share when they first come back in and they're trying to fight their way up. And in general, they had to fight against the number two, the number three and the number four player who don't have like ResMed has the leading technology, the best AirSense platform, right. The AirSense 11 globally is the best platform in all 140 countries. The second best platform in, I would say, all 140 countries is the AirSense 10 platform. So their goal is to then fight against regional player from Europe with the number three or a regional player from Asia, with the number four in the country that they're coming back. And so we're seeing that country by country. We're seeing them fight for that share at the low end. It's our focus as the market leader is on growing the market. And I think they're a fair competitor. We've competed against them for decades since they bought Respironics. And in general, we've won and taken share. We were winning and taking share from them in 2019. We're winning and taking share from the 2023 and 2024 as they come back country by country. And if and when they come back to the U.S. marketing devices, by the way, they're already here on masks, never left, and we've been competing and leading them there. I look forward to them coming back to the U.S. market so we can get any stock overhang away about what's it going to look like and what it's going to look like is what it looks like in all the other tens of countries where they fight for share from the bottom and work their way up. And I look forward to competition, a healthy competition. And we seem to do very well in it because we've got the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and it's really about that. It's about the value you provide getting that patient to the right care, lowering the cost and improving adherence. And we've done a great job, and I like all global competition in the space. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Hey, Mick, can you hear me all right? Michael Farrell : Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Suraj Kalia : Congrats on the nice quarter. So Mick, in the 2030 operating model, right? If I got your commentary right, ResMed brand and profitability, velocity of product control some of these things that you highlighted, I guess, way does Compliance Coach fit within the 2030 strategic model? More specifically, I'm just trying to understand how do you measure the ROI in the Compliance Coach. And I presume this is going to be a primarily a reactive AI model. Any additional clarity would be great? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Well, thanks, Suraj. I could spend the rest of the time answering that call around the 2030 operating model. I'll just briefly talk about it and then talk specifically about Compliance Coach. Our 2030 operating model, yes, it's the three tenets, right? The three tenets product-led, customer-centric brand enhanced. ResMed has always been product led, but now we have a Global Chief Product Officer, whose sole role is to curate that product portfolio with an amazing team of hundreds of engineers and marketers to bring the great innovation to market. So we'll measure the success on that on product velocity, how quickly do we bring innovation to market, time to market, time to success. Customer-centric. We've always been customer-centric. But we have always done the best of analyzing the Net Promoter Scores of patients, Net Promoter Scores of physicians, home care providers. Physician payer providers and so on. So really understanding the marketing metrics around that, having our first Chief Marketing Officer sit at the top table and really be laser-focused on those NPS scores and driving them up and really valuing the multibillion-dollar ResMed brand and enhancing that over time. And the third part around focusing on profitable growth and driving that leverage with our first Chief Revenue Officer, it's really around that profitable growth. And if the title was used broadly, I would call it the Chief Profitable Growth Officer rather than Chief Revenue Officer, but really, it's around keeping that discipline on the great growth we've had on the topline, but ensuring we get that leverage through OpEx R&D and particularly on SG&A in the new world to do things differently with tech.  And that segues into the second part of your question, Compliance Coach. Yes, look, this is a great AI tool. By the way, it's not generative AI Compliance Coach. The other one that we launched in Asia Pacific, the digital concierge is generative AI and has that extra capability. Compliance Coach is [garden-variety], what would have been called machine learning is now artificial intelligence, it's a great algorithm, and it's out there. The measure of that one, success on that one, Suraj, is does it lower the cost to serve at that HME or with the same labor force of respiratory therapists and pulmonary doctors can they serve more patients. So lower cost, higher efficiency, and really, the key metric is what's the adherence rate at day 90, day 365, year two, year three, in that patient cohort that's gone through Compliance Coach. Is it statistically and significantly higher than what that customer was getting before? If they're a best-in-class ResMed customer getting 87% adherence at day 90, does it go up to 90, does it go up to 92. And by the way, those customers are very sophisticated in understanding what that means for their business, what it means for them showing the payers that they reduce costs in hospital care and that they improve outcomes for the patient and how they feel and of course, how they improve their own revenue and hours through replenishment supplies. Anyway, that's my \u2013 the briefest answer I could do to that great question. Thanks, Suraj. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live. Steven Wheen : Yes. Good morning. Just a question for Brett. Brett, I was just wondering if we could look into the gross margin a little bit further and trying to understand, are we seeing in \u2013 across that quarter, the full benefit of the price that you've taken? Or is that some annualization effect as some customers perhaps roll off contracts and whether or not from a rate perspective, could you just kind of reiterate what your expectations are there, what you're seeing with regard to the pricing following the conflict? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Sure, Steve. So yes, I mean, on the gross margin and recent price increases we put through during the quarter, some of those are obviously be contractual arrangements there as well. So we've put some \u2013 some of it's gone through as a general increase, and then there will be specific contractual arrangements that means those pricing will be a little bit progressive. I guess if you look over the back half of fiscal 2024 on that. So let's call that be kind of progressively roll through. But we're definitely seeing some of that impact already on that. I think the second part of your question was around \u2013 is that around the sort of freight Red Sea disruptions and so on? Steven Wheen : Yes. Just what you were sort of intimating, if you could just repeat that commentary, what you're seeing in the market and how you actually are trying to anticipate or protect yourselves against that? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Yes. So we're definitely seeing the impact there and a lot of that shipping is obviously not going through the Red Sea, but then going around kind of good hope. So that's happening certainly increased lead times, I think, probably you could be looking at two to three weeks on that. Particularly, this is a particularly trading to Europe in particular, but also to some extent, to the U.S. where you've got to find alternate freight paths, if you like. So that's having an impact. And we're also seeing some increase in actual freight rates as well. And I think this is an industry wide not just ourselves. So we're looking at that closely. We're looking at alternative routes. We're looking at multimodal distribution there. So there's a number of things we're looking at to mitigate that where we can. But it realistically probably see some uptick in freight cross. It would not manifest in our P&L in Q3, but there could be some headwinds in Q4 on that. But again, I think we've just got to see how that evolves over the next little while. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Thanks. Good afternoon, good morning. Just another question for Brett. Brett, just regarding the restructuring charges and also the charge for the Mask recall. Is that done now in terms of those P&L costs? Or do you expect any further costs to be incurred in third quarter or indeed fourth quarter this fiscal year? Thanks. Brett Sandercock : Yes we\u2019re largely through that. I mean, I can't \u2013 I don't think you can rule out restructures from time to time, but I think the material restructure that we did is behind us now. So going \u2013 anything going forward, I think, would be pretty minor on that. So I would say \u2013 I'd characterize that as saying, yes, we've done the big restructure, and that should clear us now for the next\u2026 Michael Farrell : Just to jump in there, Brett, a little bit specifically to Saul's question about the mask with magnets upgrade of our labeling, which was classed as a recall in the U.S. and some other jurisdictions. That cost was fully taken account of in this quarter. We're not expecting to add anything more on the mask with magnets action relabel and recall in certain jurisdictions. Brett Sandercock : Yes, absolutely. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mathieu Chevrier from Citi. Your line is now live. Mathieu Chevrier : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Simple one, when do you expect to be fully transitioned the AirSense 11 platform? Michael Farrell : Mathieu, a very simple question, but rather complex answer in that we sell in 140 countries worldwide, and each of them most of them have their own regulatory pathway and often very different and complex and obviously, labeling language customization of the product for all regulatory requirements needed in all those 140 countries. So we clearly launched in our top countries were launched in the U.S. many countries in Europe. We just got Japan last quarter, the quarter before and we're starting to ramp up there. And you saw that in the good growth numbers in devices in Europe, Asia and other in the quarter of 16%, there was some good sort of starting that ramp there in a place like Japan, which, as you know, is a fleet driven market versus a by-quarter driven market. And so great to see Japan \u2013 the citizens of Japan to be able to get access to the best in the world technology in the AirSense 11. But look, we've got hundreds of countries \u2013 over 100 countries, we still have to go there. And so we've got to get regulatory country by country. And we care about people suffocating in all of those 140 countries in the same way. And so our regulatory and quality team with Dawn Haake, our Chief Quality and Regulatory Officer working intensely with all the regulatory authorities in those countries and we have to ramp that up. And then in addition, we're ramping up supply. The good news is that we have the second best platform in the world in the AirSense 10, and that is completely unconstrained. So you do suffocate and get a prescription in the country that AirSense 11 is not cleared yet, you can get access to incredibly small, quiet and efficacious therapy in the AirSense 10 platform and our best in the world mask platform. And so there's no simple answer to when it will be completely done in 100% in all countries because I think as indifferent to maybe the AirSense 7 to AirSense 8, AirSense 8 to AirSense 9 and AirSense 9 to AirSense 10 generations is that we have a pretty unique situation with our global citizenship here. We are the global leader, and we've got a different responsibility to maintain our second best platform, which is the second best in the world for a little longer. And so that will be out. And I'm not going to give a defined end date now, but I will tell you this. We're going country by country, we're driving regulatory and we're scaling manufacturing as fast as we can on AirSense 11 because it is better technology, is low cost to make, and we are able to have a premium for it in pricing. So it makes sense for us, the customers and for our shareholders. Operator : Next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Matt Taylor : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the SURMOUNT study. I think you outlined a lot of the high-level stuff there really well. My question is a little more specific. I wanted to ask about what you thought you could see in terms of comparing the two arms of GLP-1 versus CPAP plus GLP-1? Do you think you'll see a difference there what would you make of their results if there is a different one way or the other? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. And so for those of you who haven't read through the nih.gov, feel free to go. But my reading, I'm a visual learner. There's a split chart that the top half of it on the trial is a GLP-1 side and the bottom half is a placebo side. And so they have this 600-odd or less than 600 patients split between those two in a certain proportion. And then within the GLP-1 arm, they split to those on CPAP and those not on CPAP and the same within the placebo. So there ends up being four arms if you look at it. But if you go to the end of it, there's an arm that's placebo, no CPAP. So I'd just call that the placebo arm. And then there's placebo plus CPAP arm and then there's GLP alone arm and GLP plus PAP arm. So you start to get down to the subanalyses, it gets less powered. I actually \u2013 I'm reading what you are on nih.gov. So my presumption is at the highest level, they want to show that a GLP-1 is better than placebo for lowering weight and improving AHI. I think they'll achieve that primary outcome. I mean all the data show that there's 10%, 20%, 30% weight loss reduction and that should correlate to significant AI reduction. So I think they'll show that. As opposed to then the sub-studies of CPAP versus no CPAP within each of those, look, we've got 35 years of history knowing that CPAP doesn't half treat, right? I mean, the best that I've seen from weight loss reductions in bariatric surgeries and the best the GLP-1 prelim data is that it can half treat, right? Maybe 50% reduction in AHI. I'd call that half treatment. I don't think any pulmonary physician in the world would be happy with half treating an AHI with positive airway pressure. Frankly, if you're not turning the AHI to less than five, you're not truly treating the patient. And if it's higher than five, it might be residual centrals and you have to move them to a bilevel or it might be complex sleep apnea have to move them to adaptive servo-ventilation. So there's so many options between CPAP, APAP bilevel ASV that the physicians should walk through, but they wouldn't be happy unless the AHI is less than 5%. I think the probability \u2013 and don't trust me and my quote on this, Matt. Again, the primary investigator on the study, Professor Malhotra said, the idea that weight loss alone can treat sleep apnea is preposterous. That was the word he used. So you can use \u2013 and he's the PI on this study. You can use his thoughts to what he thinks between the PAP arm and the non-PAP arm. So he's sort of leaning towards what he said earlier, that best treatment for sleep apnea is not a) weight loss or b) CPAP, it's a plus b. And so that's what I expect this study to show. And we'll see the data. They will be out there in three weeks and whatever they want to release in headline and we'll continue to go. We'll continue to grow. We'll continue to drive patients into the funnel, and I think this therapeutic class will help us over the coming decade to bring more patients into the funnel. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Yes. Good morning, Mike. So, Mick, Brett, and Amy. I might ask a question about your device and mask sales there. So obviously, strong device sales, your resupply programs, obviously, giving that some focus. But masks this quarter came out weaker than where we expected. Can you talk us through where the disconnect there might be? Michael Farrell : Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And yes, really, really happy to take questions and talk about our devices business and our mask business. So look, devices growth globally, incredibly strong in the quarter at 11%. Masks growth globally incredibly strong at 9%. We talk about the market being mid-single-digit growth for devices, so we\u2019re clearly well ahead of that with the launch of AirSense 11 in Japan and Europe, Asia Rest of World and doing well in the U.S. a couple of hundred basis points above. And then in masks and accessory, you talked about global growth being in high single digits. And so beating that in U.S., Canada, Latin America, but what you're probably focusing on is the Europe, Asia and Rest of World growth there in Q2 FY2024 being 4%, right? And just to be clear, the Q2 FY2023 growth in that same category was 14%. And we were taking 500 basis points a share 12 months ago and then losing it this quarter. I really think if you look at the weighted average over that, which is, what, 18 divided by 2 is 9% is sort of more in line with the market growth in that mid- to high single-digit growth of masks there. And look, there's some things around some contracts with the particular countries that were moved from December to January and others. I'm not going to go to all the details other than to say, we look really closely at share. We look really closely at what we're doing. And this 90-day snapshot four quarters ago, which showed 14%. We weren't taking 500 basis points a share. We were holding share, growing in a little \u2013 a category here or there. And now this quarter at 4%, we're not losing 500 bps a share. We're actually holding share across that and it's due to some of those shipping areas \u2013 launch areas and frankly, a couple of tenders that will move from one month to another. So really not much to see in that. But what I will say is that as we move forward, maintaining that high single-digit growth in devices globally, and the high \u2013 sorry, mid-single-digit growth in devices globally and high single-digit growth in masks globally is not a given. We've got to drive that demand. We've got to leverage this Big Pharma trend. We've got to leverage the big tech trend \u2013 and we've got to get better at doing demand generation in the areas where we know we can push it up. And so that's what we're going to be focused on going forward. I hope that answers your question, Lyanne. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Michael Polark : Hey, good afternoon. I will ask a mask question as well following up there in a slightly different way. So the U.S. number was up 2% sequentially. Normally, you see a high single-digit increase Q-over-Q kind of year-end seasonality in the U.S. deductible flush, that kind of thing. Kind of what are the puts and takes in that number? And the specific question is, did the Magnet field safety notice kind of limit your ability to fully capture mass demand in the quarter? Or were there other influences? Thank you so much. Michael Farrell : Yes. Great question, Michael. So yes, U.S., Canada and Latin America, a 10% growth in the mask in the quarter. It was actually a very strong market growth rate, high single digits, holding share there. We do see that December, particularly for U.S. markets where high deductibles and deductibles reset December 31, some good revenue there. And so we had good comp from the year before, and both solid numbers there from the comp year before this 10% U.S. Canada Latin America growth. So I think we did really well there as we closed out the quarter. In terms of any impact from the masks with magnets update on our labeling class in the U.S. by the U.S. FDA as a recall. I got to tell you, there was no product removed from the market. This was about having our plastic clips as an option, which we scaled up manufacturing and have them as an option. So when a patient is set up, if they're a very, very small minority of people who haven't implanted pacemaker or other metal device in their upper chest or craniofacial area, then those patients are offered an upgrade to the plastic clips. For everyone else, the other 95%, 99% of patients they keep the convenience of the magnet. So that if they go to the bathroom in the night, they can come back in the dark and just clip it on and not have to seek for plastic clips to click together the magnet completely goes on there. And so as we've done that labeling upgrade, and we had a competitor do this similar one about 12 months ago, the market has been very trained in knowing to ask questions about implants to ask questions about our partner's implants. And if they have that to offer the plastics clips, which are fully available on ResMed masks as an alternative to our mass with magnets. The masks with magnets are so convenient. They're doing so well and for 99% of people, they're great. For that 1%, the HMEs are very comfortable now to ask those questions. And the other 140 countries we are working through the appropriate ways to ask the questions and get people the best mask and have the best fit and drive the best adherence over time. But they had no impact on the quarterly sales whatsoever. And we don't expect an impact going forward because this was an upgrade to a labeling that was actually in line with clinical practice over the last 12 months. And it just makes sense to do that. Thanks a lot for the question, Michael. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Kevin, and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on this call. The opportunity in front of us is huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the health care system, and this will benefit us as we seek to help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. Thank you to all 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are also shareholders for what you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to Amy to close this out. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone, for listening. We do appreciate your time and your interest. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our second quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, you can go ahead and close this out. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to ResMed\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today\u2019s earnings press release to reconcile the non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions, however, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to ResMed\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell. Mick Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect another strong period of execution across our entire business, resulting in solid topline growth and strong double-digit bottomline growth. Our results were driven by ongoing new patient demand for our devices across global markets, high single-digit growth in our Software-as-a-Service business and double-digit global growth in our Masks and Accessories business. This is exceptional performance given that we are annualizing a very strong quarter of growth in the prior year. The recent launch of our ResMed 2030 operating model and our steady focus on driving increased operating leverage are delivering excellent bottomline results and keeping us on a clear trajectory of ongoing profitable growth. Over 2 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, what I call sleep suffocation, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. These chronic conditions form a healthcare epidemic that ResMed is uniquely positioned to address. We believe that healthcare should be delivered at the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. In the optimal case, that\u2019s in a person\u2019s own home. We are the global strategic leader in providing therapies for this epidemic, as well as market-leading enterprise software for Residential Care, including home medical equipment, home nursing and beyond. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 18 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 24.5 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices that have been sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We believe the latest advances in big consumer tech and Big Pharma can potentially bring incredible numbers of new patients into the healthcare system where ResMed is uniquely positioned to provide ongoing care at home. We have a myriad of opportunities to add value, to reduce friction, to improve interoperability, to lower costs and to improve patient outcomes. We\u2019re the global strategic leader with software supporting hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their healthcare journey and navigate the complex healthcare world beyond the hospital system. Many more people can benefit from our products and solutions and we\u2019re laser-focused on growing the market to help people get on the therapy they need and on a pathway to better sleep, better health and better long-term care. Sales of our devices, including the category-leading AirSense platforms, grew 5% year-over-year globally. Excluding the one-time COVID-related ventilator sales in the third quarter of last year, global devices grew about 300 basis points higher than that, so right around 8% global devices growth. We are maintaining supply of two of the two market-leading 100% cloud-connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We\u2019re working to increase the global availability of the AirSense 11 platform by securing market-by-market regulatory clearances. We are following a similar path with our recently launched AirCurve 11 Bilevel and non-invasive ventilator platform as we continue its launch in the U.S. and beyond in the period ahead. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed Mask portfolio. Our Masks and Accessories business achieved 10% growth year-over-year, expanding at or above the market in a competitive category globally. During the quarter, we introduced our latest mask innovation into the U.S. market called the AirFit F40. The F40 features a proprietary new technology that we call AdaptiSeal. It is a silicone cushion designed to create and maintain a better facial seal even when the person is moving frequently during sleep. It leverages a fully flexible frame technology to cope with such frequent nocturnal movement. Physicians, respiratory therapists and patients love the F40 for its comfort, its fit and its ease of use. It is the smallest full-face mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets and respiratory therapists and physicians are voting with their recommendations and their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the U.S. and to swiftly bring the F40 to other global markets very soon. Mask and Accessory ReSupply programs are an important element of our offering, as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally. ResMed\u2019s clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive ReSupply programs directly for their patients. In our cash pay markets, we\u2019ve established a number of subscription programs that have been adopted by consumers. Research shows that ReSupply programs lead to better patient adherence and better long-term clinical outcomes for the patient and their caregivers. In the U.S., our ReSupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies, as well as direct subscription programs to help people take control of their own health. Regularly refreshing ongoing therapy needs including masks, tubing, humidifiers and other accessories. Let\u2019s now turn to a discussion of our top three global strategic priorities here at ResMed. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design, develop and deliver market-leading medtech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 plus countries worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world\u2019s best software solutions for Residential Care. As a global market leader in these significantly underpenetrated markets, our most significant opportunity is actually to expand and grow the market itself through awareness, diagnosis and pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better care where they live. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to do just that. The ResMed 2030 operating model changes that we made recently position us for success as a product-led, customer-centric, brand-enhanced leader in health tech. We\u2019re raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health across the globe. We are leveraging traditional market channels and investing in cost-effective, social media-driven demand generation campaigns. The goal is to help consumers concerned about their sleep and breathing find their way into appropriate screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways. As we continue on our journey to create this digital health concierge for individuals, we are tracking progress with hard metrics. We are looking at new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, including AirView, which now contains more than 27 million patient records. We\u2019re also tracking new starts in myAir, our consumer patient engagement app, where people choose to participate in their personalized healthcare journey to better sleep and better breathing. myAir now includes a population of 7.8 million users. We will drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help for their sleep suffocation into the health care system. We believe two global megatrends will further support our ongoing growth. Awareness driven by consumer tech, specifically sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch which has a de novo FDA clearance to screen for sleep apnea. We expect similar capabilities from other wearables from Big Tech including the Apple Watch and Google\u2019s Fitbit. In addition, we believe that the population of patients, the other megatrend, the population of patients coming from Big Pharma as they focus on obesity and related impacts on health, including sleep health, will bring an incredible volume of patients into the healthcare system and the patients will have clinically significant sleep apnea that is best addressed by our therapies post these other therapies. We love this attention from big consumer tech on the field of sleep wellness tracking and we believe that many of these wearable technologies will help consumers find out if they have issues with breathing during sleep or maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep issues like sleep apnea or insomnia or both, a new disease state that has been called by the physicians COMISA. Ultimately, we believe that this will lead to increased patient awareness and sustainable long-term growth for ResMed. Our goal is to educate people as they move from sleep wellness tracking with these wearables to what I call sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness to a true healthcare pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ultimately ongoing management of their sleep health and breathing health. We believe that here at ResMed we are uniquely positioned to help. Big Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications right now. For many people dealing with their obesity, their healthcare goals are focused on losing weight while improving their diet, exercise and their sleep routines. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the healthcare funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive for weight loss and other medical health. We believe this will open these patients up to knowledge of their other chronic diseases from their primary care physicians, including awareness of chronic diseases such as sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that may not have previously been considered or been treated for those patients. So we believe this will drive not just more patients into our channel, but also more motivated patients into our channel. ResMed has been tracking the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis using an overlap of our data and third-party claims data. With another quarter of data analyzed, we are now up to an incredible N equals 660,000 subjects in our analysis. The bottomline is that the data show that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we presented previously. For patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy over those not taking the drug. As we follow these patients longitudinally, the ReSupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points higher. That\u2019s 3.1 absolute basis percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. And then at T equals 24 months, the ReSupply rate is 500 basis points. So 5.0 absolute percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show clearly that these new GLP-1 pharmaceutical class is actually a tailwind for our ResMed business, bringing more patients and more motivated patients into the healthcare system. We\u2019ve included the full analysis of these data in our investor deck and I encourage you to review the data there. It\u2019s very positive information and very thorough and detailed work by our healthcare economics and outcomes research, as well as our digital health analytics teams here at ResMed. Existing clinical studies show many factors impact sleep apnea epidemiology, including craniofacial anatomy, age of the subject, gender and weight. With over 1 billion people on the planet with sleep apnea right now, 80% plus of them are undiagnosed in our biggest market, the United States and over 90% of patients are undiagnosed globally. There remains an incredible opportunity to help people sleep and breathe better through positive airway pressure therapy, the universally recognized gold standard for treating sleep apnea. We look forward to more patients entering the healthcare system for care and more motivated patients who can get on our therapy faster and stay on it longer. In terms of best-in-class treatments for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published evidence demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients\u2019 adherent to our positive airway pressure technology by combining our market-leading device platforms, our market-leading masks, with our digital health solutions. Even with this best-in-class global tech, just over 10% of patients still need alternative therapies, and we have a very high volume of patients coming through these days. We\u2019re investing in alternative therapies and we\u2019re working to help patients who just can\u2019t adhere to positive airway pressure therapy despite the latest technology to find their path to second-line therapies, such as dental devices, where ResMed has the market-leading 3D printed dental device on the planet for sleep apnea in Western Europe and Northern Europe. That\u2019s called Narval. In addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options. We\u2019re an investor in Apnimed, and we\u2019re also an investor in hypoglossal nerve-stimulation technology through our investment in a company called Nyxoah. ResMed is about sleep health, it\u2019s about breathing health and it\u2019s about delivering the best care right where you live. We make sure the person finds the path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost, most comfortable therapy that\u2019s best for them. Let\u2019s pivot now to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging our 18 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and our 24.5 100% cloud-connectable devices that are out there in our ecosystem across 140 countries. We are investing in a portfolio of artificial intelligence-driven capabilities, as well as customer-facing AI products in our ecosystem. We continue to roll out these products in our AirView ecosystem, such as Compliance Coach, that I talked about last quarter, that\u2019s rolling out in the United States. We\u2019re also progressing well with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their journey, really people before they\u2019re patients and then they become people seeking sleep health and breathing health solutions, and then on their journey they become patients. And we\u2019re rolling out that gen AI capability in the Asia-Pac region for now and we\u2019ll look to scale that as we move forward. We\u2019ll continue to share progress on this front, as this revolutionary tech is developed and scaled across our business and many of medtech and health tech peers are doing the same and our ecosystem will move forward. Our Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our non-invasive ventilator platforms and our life-support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high-flow therapy that we call HFT to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at home at a cost-effective rate. This is a long-term opportunity focused on generating evidence, developing pathways and driving new reimbursement options. We are focused on driving adoption of these technologies for treatment at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD, as well as neuromuscular diseases, continues to increase, and we have low-cost, high-efficacy and high-tech treatments in HFT and beyond to address this healthcare epidemic. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service business in the field of Residential Care, we have another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 8%. We plan to maintain high single-digit growth in the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and we plan to accelerate to double-digit growth for our Residential Care Software-as-a-Service business on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We are seeing ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our core home medical equipment channel and its ReSupply capabilities. We are driving good growth across both our Residential Care SaaS and our core sleep health and breathing health businesses while serving many hundreds of thousands of patients. Our Residential Care SaaS business is integral to ResMed\u2019s growth portfolio and we\u2019re excited to have created a global business that will achieve double-digit growth on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We continue to drive OpEx leverage by managing our capabilities for cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and R&D across our go-to-market brands that include Brightree, MatrixCare, and MEDIFOX DAN. And those synergies go not just across the SaaS businesses, but also directly into our core sleep health and breathing health business. And beyond this infrastructure leverage, our Residential Care SaaS business drives platform development synergies and customer engagement facilities and capabilities that are synergies as well, and these highly complement the market-leading medtech and software solutions capability that\u2019s there right in our core sleep health and breathing health business ecosystem, including products like AirView and myAir and beyond. We are transforming Respiratory Medicine and Residential Care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We\u2019re focused on driving topline revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability all the way to the bottomline, and we made very good progress on that this quarter. The team delivered non-GAAP operating income up 23% and non-GAAP net income up 27%. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected, and most intelligent medtech solutions. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 174 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient right where they live. We\u2019ve helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher quality lives with best-in-class healthcare. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I\u2019ll hand over the call to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we\u2019ll open up to Q&A with the entire team between Sydney and San Diego. Over to you, Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and let\u2019s note that all comparisons out of the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.2 billion, a 7% headline increase and a 7% increase in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and ReSupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a negligible impact on revenue during the March quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3%. Globally, device sales increased by 5%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis, while masks and other sales increased by 12%, reflecting growth in both ReSupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 1% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year growth moderated due to incremental revenue in the prior year quarter of approximately $15 million from COVID-related demand. Excluding the COVID-related sales, device revenue increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Masks and other sales increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME Vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 58.5% in the March quarter. The increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing cost improvements, favorable product mix and an increase in device average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 160 basis points. We continue to monitor potential headwinds that could arise from the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea have increased freight costs and shipping lead times. We estimate this will negatively impact our Q4 gross margin by around 30 basis points to 50 basis points. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.2%, compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflect savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the balance of fiscal year 2024. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4%, compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 23%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in our operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $7 million to $9 million in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20.3%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 27% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 27%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $402 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $43 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. On March 31 we had $1 billion in gross debt and $676, sorry, $769 million in net debt. During the quarter we reduced our debt by $220 million. On March 31 we had approximately $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. During the quarter we purchased 261,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to purchase shares for the value of approximately $50 million per quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward we plan to continue to reinvest in gross through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tucking acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett. Thanks Mick. Kevin, let\u2019s go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live. Dan Hurren : Thanks very much and good morning. Look, I just wanted to ask about that gross margin predictably. That recovery is pretty sharp whereas I think you had perhaps talked to a more modest gross margin recovery in the second half. So I just wanted to ask how sustainable that recovery is into fourth quarter and into 2025? Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks Dan. It\u2019s a good question and obviously as we talked about on the call a quarter ago and two quarters ago we\u2019ve got long-term programs and short-term programs that are moving very carefully to move our gross margin up. Some -- very long-term as we walk through the launch of our AirSense 11 platform which is at a better cost point, a better price point. Launch of our new masks, the F40 last quarter and these have effects that go over long-term. Some of the faster impacts we\u2019re able to do is working through the inventory that were high freight costs from the semiconductor crisis and the supply chain crisis from six months, nine months, 12 months, 18 months ago that are flowing through our system. So look, I\u2019m not upset when the team overperforms my expectations as they did here. As Brett said in Q4 we\u2019ll see some moderation of that due to Red Sea impacts of a couple of tens of basis points, sort of 30 basis points, 40 basis points. Brett can give more detail on that. But look Dan, I\u2019m very, what I\u2019m excited about... Operator : Please stand by. We appear to be having technical difficulties. Please stand by. Mick Farrell : He cannot. Brett says he can\u2019t hear us. Operator : Please proceed. Brett Sandercock : Okay. Operator : Please proceed. Brett Sandercock : Can you hear me now, Kevin? Operator : We can now. Please proceed. We did lose your audio briefly. We do apologies. Please proceed. Mick Farrell : Okay. Great. Well I\u2019ll hand over to Brett to answer the question on gross margin and then I\u2019ll follow up. I don\u2019t know where I got cut off there. Brett, you do. Over to you. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. I\u2019m not sure where that landed, but, yeah, in terms of gross margin, it is hard to predict given the movements in, we have product mix, geographic mix, timing of cost improvements, FX, freight costs. So it\u2019s all into the mix that we had pretty strong improvement through freight expense, through manufacturing efficiencies and so on coming through and that helped a lot. Stable component costs also means that\u2019s no longer a headwind there. So I think that\u2019s all reflected in the gross margin improvement. And as Mick said, in the short-term, there is some Red Sea freight cost impacts that will come through in Q4 but our goal remains to improve gross margin over the course of FY 2025. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Your line is now live. Laura Sutcliffe : Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Just sticking with gross margin, could you possibly give us an indication of how much of that 240-basis-point improvement in core gross margin was freighting and how much was manufacturing? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Brett, you can answer that. Brett Sandercock : Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. I mean, that -- of that year-on-year, the 240 basis points, the biggest contributors were the freight cost reduction and also the manufacturing cost improvements were the biggest drivers there. We saw some benefit or some favorable product mix playing out there and a little bit in terms of ASP increases, but by far the most significant two, which were significantly contributed in their own right, were the freight expense reduction and the manufacturing cost improvements. Laura Sutcliffe : Are you able to tell us sort of how it falls between freighting and manufacturing cost improvement? Brett Sandercock : I would say -- I wouldn\u2019t get drawn into specifics of each of the components, but I would say, both of those are material in their own right of contributing to that 240 basis points. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live. Craig Wong-Pan: Thank you. I just wanted to touch on the rest of world markets to see whether you\u2019re seeing much impact from business there and if any benefit was coming through from the backlog of activity with home care companies? Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Craig. And yeah, no, we really didn\u2019t see, I mean, look, we\u2019ve got many competitors out there in Europe, Asia, rest of the world, including the one you mentioned, and it\u2019s a full playing field. It has been the whole time on masks, so there\u2019s no change to anyone coming back or leaving on the mask side. On the device side, no huge impacts. We were comping a very large device number, Europe, Asia, rest of the world, this quarter last year, we had a 36% growth that we\u2019re comping. And so we had good growth there on a 36% comp at plus 1%. And if you take out from last year, a large ventilation provision in China, this time a year ago, China had a big COVID impact on ventilator purchase. If you take that out, the year-on-year growth would have been 8% in Europe, Asia, rest of world devices. So up 700 basis points. So look, the way I look at it is, we\u2019re maintaining or growing share in all of our markets on the device side. We\u2019re the market leader with the AirSense 11 platform. And we\u2019ve got the second best platform in the world with the AirSense 10 platform against all competitors and so really strong there. So no major impacts from restocking and no major impacts from competitive activity and I think we had a very, very strong performance from the team in terms of their ability to ramp up the supply over the last period and get it all out there. And we\u2019re not -- no customer is not being able to fulfill an order. If they have an order for devices, we fill it up as much as we can with AirSense 11s and then we fill up the remainder with AirSense 10s and we\u2019re able to take care of those customer needs and so really good quarter of execution by our supply chain teams, as well as our delivery teams and our commercial teams out there. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live. David Bailey : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. I just want to touch on new patient starts, maybe focusing on the U.S. if we can. Obviously, COVID had the impact of closing sleep labs and then followed on by some supply constraints around devices. Can you just give us a bit of a sense as to how you\u2019re seeing new patient starts at the moment versus a trend, perhaps, and then also just touching on trends around home sleep testing versus PSG and how that might be impacting people coming to the system? Mick Farrell : Yeah. Two great components to the same question there, David. In terms of new patient starts, as you saw in U.S., Canada, Latin America, we achieved pretty strong growth of 7% of devices in the quarter and that was on a comp, this time last year of 49%. So what I\u2019d say is, and this is what we say, is that the market is sort of, if ResMed doesn\u2019t do enough around demand gen, the market will grow at mid-single digits on devices and high-single digits on masks. Obviously, we beat that this quarter with our device growth in the U.S, Canada, Latin America at 7%. So new patient starts are strong. There is some repat there, but it\u2019s a minority, and I can tell you that new patient flow into our channel has been steady. And we said this last quarter that we\u2019re starting to get back to that steady flow of patients. We\u2019ve sort of gone through the perturbations of the COVID dip, the COVID rebound, the supply chain dip, the supply chain rebound, and now we\u2019re at steady state. So seeing really good flow of patients into the U.S. As I said on the prepared remarks, we are seeing these patients who come in on the GLP-1s and it\u2019s only N equals 660,000 patients that we\u2019re looking at, but that\u2019s quite a big cohort. And as we look at those patients, their propensity to start being 10.5% above people without a prescription for that drug, I actually think we\u2019re seeing a really good flow that I think will be a long-term, I think, there\u2019s a long period of time, the S-curve of penetration of these GLP-1s, and I think, that\u2019s going to be a long cohort of patients coming into the channel. So really good on new patient starts. And in terms of ReSupply, yeah, look, we\u2019ve got really good capabilities in the U.S., particularly with Brightree and Snap technologies and Brightree ReSupply, and our subscription models and our cash pay markets around the world. But there\u2019s a lot more runway left. There\u2019s many patients who aren\u2019t yet on a subscription program and cash pay markets, and there\u2019s many patients who aren\u2019t yet on appropriate resupply in our large and developed markets. So I would say new patient flow in is very solid. ReSupply, whether it\u2019s REPAP or reestablishing masks and accessories, is good, but a lot of runway left, a lot of runway left on both in terms of demand gen and resupply. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live. Anthony Petrone : Thanks, everyone, and congrats on a strong quarter here. Maybe, Mick, just staying on the GLP-1 topic, maybe just the House views on the SURMOUNT-OSA headline readout and as we look to the ADA meeting in June there, anything that you\u2019re really paying attention to and honing in on when we get the final data readout, are there specific secondary endpoints or sub-analyses that we should be focused in on? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And yeah, certainly we saw the headline results from that SURMOUNT-OSA trial, and look, since they had, just to be really clear, their study had that at least seven-day washout at the end on the study that had patients that had been using CPAP. So with that seven-day to nine-day washout period at the end, this was really a trial laser-focused on comparing their drug to placebo. And what it showed is somewhere in that sort of 59% to 63% reduction of AHI, and if you do the math on it and you look at the sort of average AHI coming in of around 50%, the average AHI coming out is sort of in the low 20%s. So patients were, at the end of the study, on average, were suffocating every 3 minutes of sleep after treatment for this drug, right? And so AHI of 20% or more, moderate plus sleep apnea, these patients would be treated by any sleep physician on the planet and really require positive airway pressure treatment. So I think that\u2019s the most important thing to say right up front. And so as we look at the readout that\u2019ll come in June when they release the full analysis here and the primary investigators get up and we see all the sub-analysis data, what will be interesting is to look at, because the combination therapy of CPAP plus CAPAP plus these GLP-1s had a slightly higher efficacy, if you like, it had a higher reduction in AHI. I\u2019ll be interested to look on the secondary outcomes, were there more blood pressure reductions and other cardiovascular improvements, heart remodeling and things like that happen over time and the washout period might have diluted that a little bit, it\u2019ll depend on where they took them. But those would be the things that I\u2019d be interested in on this study. As we see it, we\u2019re seeing new patients come in on this and not just anecdotally from the letters I get from patients saying, I\u2019ve been using a GLP-1 and now I\u2019m using a PAP, this combination therapy is great, I\u2019m taking care of my diet, my exercise and my sleep. But we\u2019re seeing real world evidence, real world data that we\u2019re presenting, N equals 660,000 patients and these patients start CPAP more, they adhere more. I mean, the fact that at 12 months ReSupply goes up 3.1%, 310 basis points. The fact that ReSupply at 24 months goes up 500 basis points, 5 absolute percentage points higher, means that this is not only more patients into the funnel from this drug and not just this particular drug from this particular company, but this class of drugs. We included tirzepatide and semaglutide in our analysis and others. All new gen, vast majority new gen tech. And I can tell you, we are going to do our own social media driven demand gen, but the fact that Big Tech with the Samsung Watch, the Apple Watch and Google\u2019s Fitbit are going to be bringing patients in and Big Pharma, and this is trillions of dollars of capital between these companies are going to be doing advertising to drive patients into the funnel. We think this is a net tailwind for our business. We\u2019ve started to see it somewhat now at the very early stages and we think it\u2019ll be there in the future. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be looking for from this study, Anthony. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Mick, can you hear me all right? Mick Farrell : Yes, I can, Suraj. Hopefully your phone and our phone are good throughout this question and answer. Suraj Kalia : So forgive me if there is any background noise. Mick, first and foremost, congratulations on this quarter. Mick, specifically, and I -- forgive me for belaboring this, gross margins, a nice uptick in the quarter. Mick, if I recall correctly, a couple of quarters ago, gross margins were soft and one of the reasons cited was a higher U.S. contribution, which intrinsically has lower margins than OUS. This quarter also, U.S. has ticked up nicely. Contribution has picked up. Maybe I\u2019m missing a key aspect here. Can you help us reconcile those two? Thank you for taking my questions. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Suraj. I\u2019ll have a go first and I\u2019ll hand over to Brett for detail. But as I look at it from my perspective, there are a number of factors that were positives to have such a great gross margin number this quarter. The first one was that we had excellent work by our global supply chain teams to work on getting our cost of goods sold down, not just direct COGS but OCOGS as well. And so we worked through some of that high inventory -- high cost inventory stock moved through the system, and some of the reengineering work and revalidation and verification work we\u2019ve done has been able to bring new product to market. We have a good flow between the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. But look, if you look at the growth from like 12 months ago and some of the issues, I mean, we had -- as I said earlier, we had 49% growth in our U.S., Canada, Latin America flow generators a year ago. That has a very big impact on margin as it\u2019s, lower margin than our masks business and other businesses, certainly in our ventilation and software around the world. This quarter, we\u2019re sort of back to a steady state where ResMed\u2019s growing well. We\u2019re growing at mid-to-high single digits in parts of our business and double digits in the masks and accessory side. And I think we\u2019re just back to our core execution, something that ResMed\u2019s done in our 35-year history is have operating excellence and operational excellence as a core competency. We were able to, after all those perturbations of COVID, supply chain, cost of inventory, we\u2019re able to get back to what we do really well. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d say are the main factors for us achieving such great gross margin in the quarter. Brett, do you want to provide any further detail? Brett Sandercock : Yeah. Thanks, Mick. I mean, the only thing I would add is the geographic mix impacts tend to be pretty modest. You do see that, but for example, product mixes usually has much more impact than geographic mix. So it\u2019s less of an impact on our margin either way from geographic mix. It\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not substantial. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor-Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live. Margaret Kaczor-Andrew: Hey. Good afternoon. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to maybe touch on the market demand drivers and demand gen that you referenced earlier on the call. My recollection can tell me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think you guys have sporadically maybe invested in understanding market growth drivers and the Verily partnership is the one that kind of comes to mind on that. But as you think of demand gen, can you give us any data from those programs that might help inform the demand gen that you\u2019re trying to create? Over what time period can these efforts make that impact on market growth? And again, key sources, is it local level, podcasts, newsletters, global level, celebrity, partnerships? Again, any details would be helpful. Thanks, guys. Mick Farrell : Well, yeah. Thanks, Margaret. It\u2019s a great question on how we\u2019re going to learn from our many years of experience of getting patients in the funnel and taking it to the next level and scaling globally. As you know, we\u2019ve had sort of direct to consumer campaigns in our cash paid countries, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and others around the world. One of the big changes we made in our 2030 operating model was to establish a Global Chief Product Officer, Global Chief Revenue Officer, but also a Global Chief Marketing Officer. And I think bringing that marketing function to be across the whole of the sleep health and breathing health business, and really across our whole ResMed business, is going to allow us to bring. Yeah, as you said, we did experiments in that joint venture where, by the way, we own all the intellectual property and capability of that joint venture, the assets and capability that we learned over those last many years in that JV. We\u2019ve now taken that on board and we\u2019ve said, okay, let\u2019s not just do that in one metropolitan statistical area in the United States or within one country like Australia or another country like Singapore or Korea. Let\u2019s look at ways we can scale that globally. So without signaling directly and exactly how, where, and when we\u2019re going to do it, I can tell you we\u2019ve got a global team looking at this, Margaret, and as we go throughout fiscal year 2025, we\u2019re going to talk about, as they go public, this is the campaign. One thing that is different from what we did before is that I believe in what gets measured gets done and every single campaign we\u2019re going to do is going to have hardcore metrics of sponsorship here, driven here and influence it there, this social media impact there. We\u2019ll look at the ROI, and before it scales, we\u2019re going to analyze that portfolio of primarily social media but other media-driven demand gen, and yes, it will be local, but it\u2019ll also be national, and there\u2019ll be global. The platforms will be global, the cultural impacts will be national, and then the impact will be local, and we\u2019ll be measuring that direct ROI of that marketing spend. As you saw in the quarter, we were very efficient on SG&A this quarter. We will go back to our steady state on that, not growing at revenue, well below, but getting up to better growth and those investments will go in areas like this, in demand gen on SG&A, and of course, our core R&D growth will go back into AI and generative AI. I can tell you some of our work on generative AI in Asia-Pacific, helping a patient in that digital health concierge through the channel will be a big part of our demand gen as well, so a combination between R&D and SG&A there, but great question, Margaret, and we\u2019ll update you as we move through fiscal year 2025 and beyond on our demand gen initiatives. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gretel Janu from E&P. Your line is now live. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the gross margin and more just thinking about the gross margin trajectory into FY 2025, so how should we think about the quantum of improvement likely to be achieved into FY 2025, and where\u2019s that additional step up going to come from now that you\u2019ve kind of normalized a lot of the headwinds that we\u2019ve seen in the last 12 months? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Gretel. Brett, with this great performance from your finance and our global supply chain team, you\u2019re getting all the questions this quarter, so over to you on projections for gross margin for FY 2025 to answer Gretel\u2019s question. Brett Sandercock : Yeah. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. Gretel, I mean, there is -- yeah, there\u2019s been quite a good increase year-on-year and freight and some manufacturing efficiencies, cost improvements there, obviously played a big part. We\u2019re also not so much facing the headwinds of these component cost increases that we saw sort of six months to 12 months ago as well. But if you look forward, and it\u2019s always hard to predict, as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s a lot that plays out on the gross margin, product mix, the timing of the cost improvements or the continuous improvement programs that we\u2019re now running, and we\u2019ve had an opportunity to do that. We\u2019re really, really focused on supply and getting devices into the market. So now as that stabilizes, then that gives us an opportunity to work on cost improvement programs. So we\u2019re focusing on that. So the goal, without being specific on targets, but certainly our goal is to improve gross margin over the course of FY 2025. And we\u2019ve got, probably need to do that on a number of fronts, which is more around a continuous improvement or gradual improvement program now, I think, as we work through FY 2025. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. Brett Fishbin : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Really appreciate some of the updates that you guys have provided on the data front. And I think what stood out to me a lot with the last couple of updates was the 10% plus type of increase that you\u2019re seeing in PAP initiation rates for the GLP users. And then especially considering this isn\u2019t really even reflecting some of the likely marketing activity from pharma. So curious, some of the factors that you think might be driving this correlation and then maybe looking ahead where this number could potentially go once we\u2019re actually seeing patients that are prescribed with under an OSA indication and diagnosed with OSA? Mick Farrell : Yeah. Brett, it\u2019s a really good question. It\u2019s quite a complex one and I think it\u2019ll play out over time. We\u2019ve obviously got very strong quantitative data with the 660,000 subjects that we\u2019re following in that analysis. But we get a lot of anecdotal information from folks, all the way from folks who are involved in the clinical research to frontline physicians through our network and we position this across 140 countries. These new medications are primarily focused on the U.S. and Western Europe right now. But as we watch, our hypothesis is that this new therapy is bringing people into the healthcare system who weren\u2019t previously there. They weren\u2019t choosing to go as frequently to their GP or their primary care physician. They are now seeing that PCP, that GP, and now they are getting treated for not only their obesity, but now other chronic diseases and we\u2019ve seen this in other disease states from some of our peers here in medtech. But yeah, it\u2019s quite extraordinary to have 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy. There are not many other factors recently in terms of innovations from biotech and pharma that we\u2019ve seen that could drive this level. And so it is early days as those drugs are penetrated in the U.S., Western Europe, and beyond. But we\u2019re watching it very closely. I do think that these trillions of dollars worth of capital will bring lots of advertising and will bring lots of patients into the funnel. And then our job will be to help those patients to find the best path to the best therapy and the best therapy is positive airway pressure therapy and we\u2019re seeing that in these early days. And yeah, I think as we move forward, we\u2019ll learn more and we\u2019ll keep updating as we go every quarter on our flow of patients that come into the funnel, how we\u2019re seeing them and how we\u2019re taking care of them through our own demand gen, through the demand gen that will be driven by this Big Pharma. And one that we didn\u2019t get a question on, but I talked about on my prepared remarks there on Big Tech. I think the fact that there\u2019ll be wearables on tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people\u2019s wrists, looking at oximetry, looking at nocturnal sleep, looking at nocturnal breathing and helping patients find out if they\u2019re not sleeping well, they\u2019re not breathing well. I think that might actually be a higher tidal wave than the Big Pharma tidal wave. But we\u2019ll watch that as we move forward, DAN. Thanks for the question, Brett. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Mike Matson : Yeah. So with the news that Coops [ph] is exiting the non-invasive ventilation market, is there an opportunity for ResMed to pick up some share in this category? And if so, can you maybe talk about how big you think that market is? Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. And the competitor you mentioned is leaving the U.S. market for life support ventilation. They will still, at this point, I think, claim to be coming back with CPAP, APAP and Bilevel. So that Bilevels are non-invasive ventilation. They reach an area of non-invasive ventilation. So we expect them back in that market. Look, I think there are opportunities in ventilation. Obviously, we saw through the COVID crisis, there was a very large volume of ventilators sold into the world in 2020, 2021, 2022. We talked about even just in 2023, we\u2019re lapping a quarter where there were large sales a year ago into China of ventilators. And so I think, if you like, the supply of ventilators into the market is quite high. So there\u2019s no huge sort of immediate opportunity by our competitor leaving life support ventilation in the U.S. But we are there to take care of our customers wherever they are, whatever country they\u2019re in and whatever needs they have. For us, the more material growth is really around driving our CPAP, our APAP and our Bilevels with AirSense 11 and AirCurve 11. And the AirCurve 11, in terms of your question, non-invasive ventilation, has AirCurve S, AirCurve ST and AirCurve FTI. And at the highest level, it has an AirCurve ASV, which is the highest level of adaptive server ventilation. All these together form types of non-invasive ventilation to treat patients with COPD or neuromuscular disease that leads to respiratory insufficiency. And ResMed has the best platform in the planet to treat them. We think it\u2019s a huge opportunity. Many hundreds of millions of patients worldwide have COPD, neuromuscular disease and respiratory insufficiency and ResMed is there for them now and will be for them there in the future. It\u2019s a long-term growth opportunity. It\u2019s not a short-term pop. It\u2019s a long-term growth opportunity for us to take care of these patients and help them sleep better, breathe better and our AirCurve platform is going to be fantastic to do that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning, all. I might come back to the real-world data, Mick. Obviously, some good resupply improvements there, 300 basis points and 500 basis points. But is there anything you can share on the data or the trend for lower severity OSA patients, sort of the mild to moderate categories? And then also, secondly, on the data, whether we do this or a separate data set, what trend are you seeing in the percentage of patients who have ceased CPAP therapy as a result of weight loss drugs? Yeah. So it\u2019s a good question, Lyanne, and there are sort of multiple parts to it. I\u2019ll address it at a high level, which is to say, yeah, look, the real-world data is excellent. It\u2019s the largest data set out there with 660,000 patients that have been prescribed a GLP-1 and are on positive airway pressure therapy and we\u2019re really laser-focused on tracking that cohort very carefully. We can and will look to, in the future, slice and dice it by AHI, 5 to 15, 15 to 30, 30 plus. We\u2019ll look to slice and dice it by age, by gender, by geography and others. A lot of that will be for our internal work so that we can best drive social media marketing and know which patients to go after. For instance, the public information out there is that women are using GLP-1s more than men, and they\u2019re more adherent to the GLP-1s than men are. The rate that people quit the GLP-1 therapy is a lot higher in men than women. And so we\u2019re tracking a lot of that information publicly and we will, over time, release it. We haven\u2019t seen at all a correlation or information around people quitting PAP therapy because of a GLP-1. It just doesn\u2019t compute in the data we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s the other way that it\u2019s a huge tailwind for people coming in. Look, when we see -- as we say, we get 87% adherence. We\u2019re very proud of that. For the 13% that don\u2019t get there, we look at all the reasons why. Is it claustrophobia? Is it insomnia, where they have a psychological condition where they can\u2019t fall asleep and then they blame it on the CPAP mask when it\u2019s really a fact of a need to have treatment or their insomnia, as well as or in parallel to or even before their OSA. So we\u2019re looking at all types of reasons for that. But, look, we\u2019ll continue to update you and the rest of the world as we do the slice and dice by HI, by age, by gender, to find the best way to help patients find the best path to therapy. But right now, we\u2019re seeing a huge trend of more patients coming in, more motivated patients, and our challenge is to keep up with that and make sure that we can scale and help them get on that great digital health journey. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live. Steve Wheen : Yeah. Thanks very much. I just had a question around the AirSense 11 and its availability and the pathway to it being kind of the platform that you 100% rely upon. If you could just give us an update as to how that looks for the remainder of this year and perhaps into 2025? Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I\u2019ll start out with this fact that we\u2019re still selling the S9 product in China right now. And so, getting rid of it completely, right, the AirSense 10, will take a while because there\u2019s great markets around the world where technology is useful for a long period of time. But I think what you\u2019re talking to is the materiality of the AirSense 11 becoming the primary in global markets. I can tell you this, the AirSense 11 is already the primary platform in our biggest market in the U.S. It\u2019s already well into the majority and growing quickly. And no customer who wants to order from ResMed can\u2019t get AirSense 11s, as well as AirSense 10s. We do limit sometimes the AirSense 11s, because there\u2019s so many customers from small, large regionals to statewide groups to nationals and we\u2019ve got to balance the flow to make sure every person has a fair chance to get an AirSense 11 and then we cover the difference with the awesome AirSense 10s. So, we\u2019re already over the majority in the U.S. As we look at other big markets around the world, you know, Germany, Japan, France, U.K., and beyond, the AirSense 11s are ramping very quickly and they\u2019ll quickly get to the majority across those areas. As we look to more of the countries, hundreds more countries around the world than those top 20, our job is, as I said in the prep remarks, to get the regulatory clearances. Some of these countries require all separate paperwork and time and effort, and so we have to analyze how quickly we can do that and we are also working with authorities to see if we can get clearances that can be used across multiple regions. And so, Steve, we\u2019re working very hard to get AirSense 11 in all countries and to the majority in all countries. I hope that answers your question. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just another quick one for Brett. Brett, just looking at the inventory balance, it came down quite significantly into the third quarter. It\u2019s the lowest inventory has been, I think, since 2022. Just wondering where you think inventory goes from here. Do you think you need to start to sort of rebuild as it relates to sort of product demand or do you think you can drive that dollar value down further? Thanks. Brett Sandercock : Yeah. Hi, Saul. I think, yeah, we had -- I mean, the team\u2019s been working hard on that for a while now, so you\u2019re starting to see the results there in the balance sheet and in the inventory, which is great. We\u2019re getting pretty close to our targets on inventory, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s -- there could be modest reductions, there could be modest gains there. It\u2019s more around making sure we\u2019re balancing supply and demand now. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty close to targets on kind of where we\u2019re at now for the inventory. Saul Hadassin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Matthew Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Mike Toomey : Hi, guys. It\u2019s Mike Toomey covering for Matt Taylor. Thanks for taking my question and fitting me in here. Coming back to Philips, I know you said you\u2019re maintaining or growing share in the markets where they\u2019re returning, but are you seeing any significant pricing pressure or pricing discounts from them and any thoughts on when they might return to the U.S. market based on the consent decree? Thanks. Mick Farrell : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. And no, look, what we\u2019re seeing in the markets where that competitor\u2019s returned is that they\u2019re pricing for value and they\u2019re trying to compete on value. And primarily as they come back from sort of zero percent share with new patients as they start in the market, they\u2019re competing with the sort of Tier 2 and Tier 3 players, so a local player in Europe or a local player in Asia, and they\u2019re not touching our share as the global market leader and global technology leader in this space. And the work that we\u2019ve been able to do these number of years that they were out of each market is to really entrench ourselves because we\u2019ve got the lowest cost, the highest efficacy, the best technology, and physicians love our digital data, patients love the engagement with myAir and the whole ecosystem creates that value. So we really have seen, you know, as they come in, they\u2019re pricing for value and competing with Tier 2, Tier 3 players in those markets. As to when they\u2019ll re-enter from zero percent new patient share into the U.S. market, I don\u2019t know. You can do your own analysis on consent decrees. This one\u2019s a very severe one. It has a lot of inspectors, sort of five times the normal number of inspectors. I think five versus one and a lot of constraints on that. I look forward to great competition. We\u2019ve got good competition from the players there now. When they come back, they\u2019ll have to compete with them first and us after that. But, no, look, we were winning and taking share from that competitor in 2019 all the way from 2010 to 2019. We\u2019ll continue to do that and beat them whenever they come back to market. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments. Mick Farrell : Great. Well, thanks, Kevin, and thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining this call, especially our shareholders. The opportunity in front of ResMed is huge and largely untapped. It\u2019s an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the healthcare system. This will benefit us as we help them sleep better, breathe better, and to live better and healthier and happier lives in over 140 countries. Thank you to 10,000 ResMedians, many of whom listened to this call and are also shareholders, for all that you do today and every day. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Amy and we can close it out. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Mick, and thanks, everyone, for listening. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out directly. This concludes ResMed\u2019s third quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, I\u2019ll turn it back to you to officially close us out. Operator : Thank you. This concludes ResMed\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hello everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile the non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on our reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell. Michael Farrell : Thanks Amy, and thank you to our shareholders for joining us as we announce results from our full fiscal year 2024 and review our fourth quarter results in more detail. Our global ResMed team executed incredibly well in our fourth quarter, producing another strong period of growth and execution across our business. With solid performance across all regions and all segments of our business and strong double-digit bottom-line growth. Ongoing new patient demand for our market leading flow generators remained robust in the quarter, even against a very tough year-over-year comparable. Media interest in sleep apnea and all the various therapies seems to be helping patients find their way to screening, diagnosis and therapy. And especially the lowest cost, most efficacious therapy with the best outcomes, which is positive airway pressure therapy. In terms of our masks and accessories, business physicians, respiratory therapists and patients are choosing ResMed masks when they start therapy and as they continue through resupply, resulting in very strong double-digit growth in our masks and accessories business. Our residential care software business delivered double-digit growth in revenue and in net operating profit. Our laser focus on operating leverage has delivered another quarter of strong, profitable growth and we're well positioned to continue on this trajectory as we launch into fiscal year 2025. Over 2.4 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. As the market leader in respiratory medicine and residential care globally, here at ResMed, we're uniquely positioned to drive increased market penetration through demand generation to accelerate growth. These chronic conditions in sleep health and breathing health form a global health epidemic that ResMed is well positioned to address. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible, in the optimal case, that's right, in a person's own home. ResMed is the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We're leading the industry in digital health solutions, with approximately 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and 26 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We've leveraged these de-identified data to show that our therapy solutions lower costs, improve outcomes and bend the curve of chronic disease progression. Significant opportunities remain in digital health, and we plan to be right there at the cutting edge of innovation. The latest advances in wearables from the consumer technology industry and the latest medicines from big pharmaceutical companies will bring more and more new patients into the healthcare system. We have many opportunities to add value, expanding interoperability, lowering costs and improving patient outcomes. Billions of people can benefit from our products and solutions, and we're focused on expanding our reach and growing the market to help people get on their pathway to better sleep, better breathing and better care at home. Sales of our flow generator devices, including the category leading AirSense 11 platform, grew 6% year-over-year globally. We're supporting the global market and every patient who needs a device has access to our market leading 100% cloud connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We continue increasing the availability and production of our AirSense 11 and our AirCurve11 platforms worldwide as we secure regulatory clearances and launch these market leading technologies country by country. Our masks and accessories business grew 15% year-over-year, expanding in a competitive category globally. Our latest mask innovation, the AirFit F40, introduced last quarter, is doing extremely well in the markets that it has launched in. New patients are selecting the F40 for its comfort, fit and ease of use. It is the smallest profile oronasal mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets, and respiratory therapists are voting with their setup protocols, and physicians are voting with their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the US and across global markets as we increase availability and introduce the F40 into more and more countries throughout fiscal year 2025. ResMed's clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients, and we're successfully establishing subscription programs in our cash pay countries to help consumers find their path to therapy with resupply directly. Masks and accessory resupply programs are a very important part of our offering as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally, research shows that resupply programs can both improve patient adherence and improve long-term clinical outcomes. In the US our resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies and programs to help people take control of their own health, regularly refreshing their ongoing therapy needs. As the global leader in significantly underpenetrated markets, our most important opportunity is to expand and grow the market through awareness, diagnosis and seamless pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better residential care. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to raise awareness and create pathways for patients to help them find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health. We're serving traditional healthcare channels as well as investing in cost effective, social media driven, demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their sleep and breathing, find ways their own personal way into appropriate screening, diagnosis, treatment and management pathways. Our physician and provider-based software ecosystem called AirView now contains over 28 million patient records. Adoption of our consumer patient engagement app, which is called myAir, where people choose to participate in their personalized sleep health journey, remains incredibly active and now includes over 8.3 million users. These digital health ecosystems are growing every quarter, showing the engagement of physicians as well as patients in accessing their own data to measure progress along their personal health journey. As we look to the future, I've discussed two global megatrends that I believe will further support ongoing growth for ResMed. Awareness of sleep health issues driven by consumer technology companies, specifically, sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch, which has a De Novo FDA clearance to screen for moderate to severe sleep apnea. And we expect similar capabilities from other wearable players in consumer tech such as the Apple Watch, Google's Fitbit, the Oura Ring, WHOOP and Garmin. In terms of the second megatrend behind future patient growth, we are seeing increased volumes of patients entering the healthcare system driven by the efforts of big pharmaceutical companies as they increase awareness of the treatments for diabetes and obesity medicines and they continue their research into the impacts of these medicines on sleep apnea. Together, we believe these two mega trends in consumer tech and big pharma will increase patient awareness and be a significant tailwind for long term growth here at ResMed, our goal is to educate people as they move from what we call sleep wellness tracking on a wearable to what we would call sleep health tracking, where they are seeking the help, advice and care of a health professional in the field of sleep medicine. This connection pathway from consumer awareness of sleep health and breathing health issues into a true healthcare pathway is what we are calling the digital health concierge opportunity. Our plan is to be there for that person as they go through the process of screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their sleep health and their breathing health for life. Big Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications. For many people dealing with their obesity and diabetes issues, their healthcare goals are focused on losing weight while improving their diet, cardiovascular exercise and their sleep routines, something that Bill Dement called the triumvirate of health. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the healthcare funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive to achieve and maintain weight loss. We believe this will open them up to treating other chronic diseases that they may suffer from, including increased awareness of sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that they may not have previously considered or been treated for. So, it's not just driving more patients into our channel, but we believe it's also driving more motivated patients. The emphasis on GLP-1 medications and increased focus by Big Pharma has put a spotlight on sleep apnea like never before. We believe that the growth in weight loss drugs will be a net positive for our business and the data support that thesis. ResMed has added to the biggest study in the field and our data which is using real world evidence of the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis leveraging third party claims data. We now have an expanded cohort of over 811,000 de-identified subjects in our analysis. This analysis demonstrates that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients both seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we have presented previously. For patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.7 absolute percentage points higher propensity to start PAP therapy over those without a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that patients with this drug prescription are more motivated to start their CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy. In terms of longer-term impacts on PAP therapy, we have seen that the resupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points, so 3.1 absolute percentage points higher for the patients who have a GLP-1 prescription and further at T equals 24 months, the resupply rate is 530 basis points, or 5.3 absolute percentage points higher for PAP therapy resupply for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that the new pharmaceutical class is a clear tailwind for our business, bringing more patients into the healthcare system. And more than that, we believe it is bringing highly motivated patients into the healthcare system. We've included this updated analysis in our quarterly earnings PowerPoint deck and I encourage you to review the data there in further detail. ResMed is the clear world leader in sleep health, breathing health and healthcare delivered at home. Frankly, it's our obligation and it's our brand promise. It's the ResMed brand promise to ensure that sleep concerned consumers find their path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost and most comfortable therapy that's out there and it's best for them. Our peer reviewed and published evidence demonstrates that we can achieve over 87% to PAP technology, 87% adherence to PAP technology in the first 90 days by combining our market leading device platforms with digital health solutions, myAir and AirView. Of course, that means that 13% of patients in that scenario still need alternatives and ResMed wants to be there to help those patients too. So, we are investing in alternative therapies to help patients who can't adhere to PAP therapy to find their pathway to second line therapies. And that includes dental devices where ResMed provides Narval, the market leading 3D printed dental device for treatment of sleep apnea with dental treatment in western and northern Europe. In addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options with our investment in ApneaMed and hyperglossal nerve stimulation technology with our investment in NIC SOA. So, let's step back and talk about broadly our digital health technology investments. Leveraging an extraordinary ecosystem of almost 19 billion nights of de-identified medical data, we are developing and continue to expand our portfolio of artificial intelligence driven capabilities, as well as customer facing AI products that we're launching into the market from our ecosystem. We continue to roll out and expand the AI products in AirView such as compliance coach in the United States and our new smart coaching pilot which is expanding into a few new countries as we go through our current quarter, which is Q1 of fiscal year 2025 and beyond. We are also progressing with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their health journey. A project that was initially piloted within our Asia Pacific region, our generative AI sleep concierge that we call Dawn and yes, that is a reference to the sun rising at dawn after a great night of sleep. Dawn was recently expanded from Asia Pac into our US market. We'll continue to share the progress on this front of GenAI and simple ML and generic AI as well, as this tech is further developed and scaled across our business. It's going to enhance the user experience and drive consumer awareness and what we're focused on is outcomes, not the tech, but what it can do for a patient, a physician, a provider. In our residential care software as a service business, we had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 10%, supported by strength in our home medical equipment provider business through our Brightree brand, as well as very strong growth in our home nursing and nursing home business with our MEDIFOX DAN brand. We've made very good progress in the business segment throughout fiscal 2024 and we plan to maintain high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth throughout each quarter in fiscal year 2025. But really importantly, we're driving operating leverage and we're going to have very strong double-digit net operating profit growth from our residential care software business sector in 2025. Our residential care software business is integral to the broader ResMed growth portfolio with ongoing synergistic growth opportunities across our businesses. We are accelerating growth across our residential care software business intrinsically, but we're also helping to support the core business through mask and accessory resupply growth. We continue to drive operating leverage by managing across our businesses with capabilities managed such as cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and research and development velocity across our software platforms and with our core sleep, health and breathing health businesses. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care software at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across the 140 plus countries that we serve. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We're focused on driving top line revenue growth, but with strong cost discipline and increasing efficiencies to accelerate profitability at the bottom line. We made excellent progress on that this quarter. The global team delivered growth in non-GAAP operating income of 30%. The global team also delivered growth in non-GAAP net income of 30%. I'm more than incredibly proud of our global team and their performance. We provide differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent technologies. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 178 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, or a complete mask directly to a patient, or a digital health software solution that provides personal care. We've helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher quality lives with best-in-class healthcare delivered right where they live. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to 10,000 plus ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today and every day across 140 countries. Thank you, team. With that, I'll hand the call over to our CFO Brett, who's in Sydney this morning for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A with the global team here in San Diego and Sydney. Over to you Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q4 ,group revenue for the June quarter was $1.22 billion, a 9% headline increase and 10% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and resupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a minimal impact on revenue during the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in US, Canada and Latin America increased by 10%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other regions increased by 8%. Globally, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%. Breaking it down by regional areas device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 5%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis. Masks and other sales increased by 17%, reflecting growth in both resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other regions, device sales increased by 8% on a constant currency basis and masks and other sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis. Software as a service revenue increased by 10% in the June quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 330 basis points to 59.1% in the June quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing and component cost improvements, favourable product mix and an increase in average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 60 basis points. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing cost improvements partially offset by increased freight costs. We continue to monitor the freight cost headwinds arising from the Middle east, conflict and congestion in Asian ports. We expect increased freight cost rates will continue to impact our gross margin in fiscal year 2025. We have made good progress expanding gross margin over the last several quarters and we will continue to drive initiatives to improve gross margin. Looking forward, we estimate our gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in fiscal year 2025. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.8% compared to 21.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year 2025. Consistent with historical trends, we expect Q1 FY '25 will be at the higher end of this range. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to 7% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 30%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was 6 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense in the range of $1 million to $3 million in Q1 FY '25. Additionally, we will likely generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025. During the quarter, we recognized unrealized losses of $15 million associated with our minority investment portfolio. This reduced our Q4 earnings per share by $0.10. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.7%. Broadly consistent with the prior year quarter, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 30% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 30%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $440 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $25 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. During the quarter, we reduced debt by $300 million. As of June 30, we had $707 million in gross debt and $469 million in net debt. And we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a healthy liquidity position. Today, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, representing an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. During the quarter, we purchased 232,000 shares under our previously authorised share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to repurchase shares the value of approximately $50 million per quarter in fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions, and continue with our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett, and thanks, everyone. Kevin, I'd like to turn the call back over to you to review the Q&A instructions and run that portion of the call. Operator : Certainly with that be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Yeah, good morning, Mick, Brett and Amy. Can I start with devices that came in a little bit lower than what I had expected? And can you give us some color? In terms of that 6% increase in device revenues? How much of that do you think is driven by November price increases? How much is the AX 11 mixed benefit? And how much of that is volume? And then on volume, are you seeing any change in that new start pipeline coming through? Michael Farrell : Well, thanks for your question, Lyanne. That lets me talk through our really strong growth I believe in our devices business. Just to refresh in Q4 fiscal year '23 just 12 short months ago we were talking about US device growth of 30% and Europe, Asia, rest of world growth of 15%. So incredible double-digit comps that we're building these numbers off and we saw really good growth in the US of 5% growth in our US, Canada, Latin America and we saw 8% growth in Europe, Asia, rest of the world. We're in full competition with all the players out there and as you said, 6% constant currency globally. Look, you know, the market is growing in that mid-single digits and we are holding share or gaining share. But really now as the global market leader, our primary focus is on demand generation. Where are their capacities in the field for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management? That we can drive appropriate demand generation not to overflow the channel, but to make sure that any spare capacity in screening, diagnosis and treatment and management can come through. So, I was very impressed by those numbers. I think they're right in line with market and slightly ahead in Europe, Asia and rest of world. And I think the team did incredibly well. And we're doing it through patient flow, which is very strong. And yes, there are some ASP changes in there. They're kind of small. Our costs have gone up, and we did have some adjustments to pricing over the last 12 months. But the primary generator here is the flow of patients, which, as I said in the prep remarks, we're seeing really good flow of patients. And our job as the global market leader is to continue to have that grow and grow even faster as we go throughout the fiscal years ahead. Thanks for your question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is out live. Steven Wheen : Yeah thanks. I just had a question with regards to the gross margin. The -- are you going to quantify the freight-related expectations that you would have for the next quarter. And are you being able to introduce rate levies again given the spike in sea freight charges at the moment? Michael Farrell : So, thanks for the question, Steve. I'll hand that over to Brett to cover some issues around GM and really good accretion of our gross margin year-on-year and sequentially, Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Yes, Steve, we're seeing -- I mean, we're seeing pressure on freight cost, particularly around the rates, the quite significant increases. I think everyone's seen those. So that is obviously, will continue to be a headwind for us, but we think notwithstanding that, we should be in that 59% to 60% range on gross margin. There's a lot of factors, as you know, play into that. But the freight will be a headwind. In terms of -- really, I guess it depends how whether it's sort of permanent or transitory and see how the market goes in terms of freight that obviously, those costs we're bearing at the moment. So, what we do going forward, I think, is something we'll think about as the year goes on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Brett Fishbin : Hey guys, how are you doing? Thank you so much for taking the questions. Wanted to ask a quick follow-up on the gross margin question just now. Just thinking about some of the year-over-year trend, it looks like 2024 is finishing at about 57.7%, and you're guiding to 59% to 60%. So maybe if you could just walk through some of the positive incremental drivers relative to how we're exiting the second half year? And you already touched on the freight as a partial offset? Thank you. Michael Farrell : So Brett, back to you, gross margin. Brett Sandercock : Yes, sure. The -- you -- to clarify, you talking into the future gross margins? Brett Fishbin : Specifically, just asking about some of the commentary for FY '25 relative to FY '24. Brett Sandercock : Yes, going forward. So going forward, I guess there's some factors at play out on the gross margin. Some of these big positive. We talked about freight, which will be a headwind. But if you -- if we look forward, we have cost optimization initiatives that we're getting back to now, whereas previously, we were really just trying to meet demand and catching up. But now we're getting back to running a more regular cost optimization programs. So, we'll do that. We're building the pipeline of those initiatives, that will be around manufacturing improvements and efficiencies. It will be around the procurement initiatives than what we do there. And also, we'll get -- with the volumes we have now, we'll also get scale benefits coming through. So, they're kind of the areas, I guess, we look at in terms of cost optimization in supply chain. Other factors the continued transition to the AS 11 platform will be supportive of gross margin into FY '25. We think product mix will likely be favorable through the course of FY '25, that will be supportive. And I guess the last one is just around new product introductions as you introduce new products that helps with less discounting and you're able to price that according to the features and the value of those products. So, there are some of the factors, I think that will play out in FY '25. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Michael Matson : Yeah, thanks. So, I guess, first, I just want to ask about Philips. Have you seen them reentering any of the international markets in any meaningful way with devices specifically? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And yes, our -- I guess I'll call them our #4 competitor right now, right, because they've dropped down to fourth in new patient share globally. That competitor is back in many markets in Europe Asia and Rest of World, we grew in the quarter, 8% in Europe, Asia, rest of the world on a comp of 15%. So, if you see which I do, the market growing in mid-single digits. ResMed is taking share in Europe, Asia, rest of the world relative to our competition. So, competitors from Europe like the one you named, but there's other ones that have higher share and competitors from Asia who have higher shares than them. And so, I think that competitor as they come back are having to earn their way back. We've got to try to repair their brand, try to repair their approach that they're going to have a safe and efficacious product, and they're competing with the Tier 2, Tier 3 players and working their way in. They had a call last week, and they sound like they're growing from a very low base to something better, and that's good on them. I love competition. ResMed is the market leader. We have the smallest, quietest, the most comfortable devices, but more important than that, they're the most connected and the most intelligent and it's all about the ecosystem of AirView and myAir and getting those data to the cloud and getting to doctors, getting to physicians. So yes, that competitor is back in a number of markets. And as we said last quarter, the quarter before, we were beating them from 2010 to 2019, 2020 before they had the recall, and we're going to beat them as they come back and we've shown that this quarter, and we'll continue to show it going forward. Michael Matson : Okay, got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee, your line is now live. Dan Hurren : Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about that mask growth and the impact of the new products. And specifically, does that strong growth are reflective of an element of initial stocking? Or is that level of growth representative of what the new products can sustain? Michael Farrell : Look, it's a good question because we talk about mask growth being high single digits. And then obviously, in this quarter. We performed right there in Europe, Asia, rest of the world at 9%, right there in that high single digits. Then in U.S., Canada, Latin America, we performed at 17% growth. On a pretty good comp actually of 19% from the year before. So double digit on double digit. Look, you're not going to grow double digits in masks forever when the market is growing at high single digits, and you are the clear market leader. But you can drive demand generation and you can drive better resupply programs. And I said in the prep remarks, we've done a lot of investment in Brightree, Snap Technologies and all of the digital health technology that we have to support home medical equipment providers here in the U.S. market. And then globally, we've really set up some great subscription programs where people, frankly, I think, have been underserved in Europe, Asia and rest of world with the ability to get fresh equipment if they love their device and they love their mask, why isn't it super simple to just click on an app see the price and get a drop ship delivery of a device to your place in a cash pay market where those same people are doing the same and have done with Amazon and all the other WeChat in China, Amazon, the U.S., et cetera, et cetera, globally. Everyone has seen this in the consumer field. And so I think health care needs to catch up and be more consumer focused and in those cash pay markets. We've set up some great subscription programs. And in the more regulated provider-based markets like the U.S. and Europe, we're really partnering with our providers like never before. So that's how we saw the outperformance. That's how we saw the extra demand generation. That's how we saw the extra resupply. Our goal is to meet or beat market growth every quarter that we go ahead. The team did it really well this quarter, and I have confidence that we'll be able to do it going forward. Thanks for the question about masks. It's a really important part of our business. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live. David Bailey : Morning. Thanks to -- thanks Mick and Brett. Just thinking about longer-term new patient growth. You sort of mentioned that the awareness piece could potentially increase on the back of some of the GLP-1 studies and data. Just on the diagnosis side of things. Are there any constraints in your view to more new patients coming through. And I suppose I'm getting to -- the question is, when do you think you might see an inflection from or an increase in that sort of mid-single-digit growth to something a little bit higher? Michael Farrell : Yes, David, it's a really good question, and it's sort of the 3.5 decade question for ResMed, right, which is how do you get people screen diagnosed and treated for a disease, whether they're unconscious when they suffer from it in sleep apnea, being asleep while you have the suffocation. So, education, awareness and better protocols to get patients into the funnel screening diagnosis, treatment and management has been our decades long mission. And look, we did very well, I think, going through COVID and on the other side to apply increases in home sleep apnea testing increases in remote patient monitoring and technology that we've used to help. And so, I do think the big pharma GLP-1 trend is bringing more and more patients in and they're very motivated patients. You saw our latest update on our real-world evidence, 111,000 patients seeing 10.7 absolute percentage points, high propensity to start CPAP. These are very motivated patients over the average patient. And I think that's a big trend. You didn't mention in your question, but I will, David, consumer tech, the wearables. I mean, Samsung dropping the mic there on the other consumer tech companies to say, we've got a de novo clearance to screen for monitor severe sleep apnea from a watch, from the Samsung Galaxy Watch. And I know the Apple Watch has an oximeter on it, and they can do the same. We know Google's Fitbit team have been doing sleep architecture for years. And they will start to recognize many patients with this. So, the real question is not will there be a flow of patients from consumer tech and big pharma. That's going to happen. The real question is, can ResMed really pick up and fight and be the world leader in a digital sleep health concierge to take that sleep concern consumer and help them find a path to a health care specialist to a protocol to a system that gets them screened, diagnosed and treated. We're making good progress on it. We've got a number of experiments globally. We're partnering with an ecosystem of other smaller players out there as well as our own technology in all 140 countries. I can tell you the experiments are happening, and we're seeing some success. The question of the inflection point, look, I do think we can take market growth rate and move it up by 50, 75, 100, maybe even 125 basis points. We're not going to double it. It's a huge, huge global franchise now. Look at our trailing 12 months revenue north of $4.5 billion, but I do think we can move it up 50, 75, 125 basis points by bringing these new technologies that help with that digital sleep pathway. Yes, I'm aware I've got a disease, my watch has told me I'm at risk what do I do about it? ResMed needs to be there to help that person find their pathway through the convoluted frankly, global health care systems to therapy. For those who are coming in the big pharma one, they're already in the health care system. They're going to a primary care physician or a specialist doctor. So that's an even easier route where it's more about education and driving the traditional channels. So we're working both, social media, digital and traditional channels. And together, I do think there's opportunities to accelerate market growth and watch this space. We've done well over the years, and we've learned a lot in these last five years. And now as the global leader, it's our obligation to do this, and we're all over it. Thanks for the question, David. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from E&P. Your line is now live. Gretel Janu : Thanks. Good morning. Just back on the gross margin and the guidance of 59% to 60% for FY '25, how should we think about the cadence of that throughout the first half and second half weaker first half, stronger second half given freight or relatively consistent throughout each quarter? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Yes. Good question, Gretel. Over to you, Brett. And it feels like this is the after call with modeling. But over to you, Brett. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Gretel. Yes, I mean, we're at 59.1%, I guess, exit there. I think we've got a 59% to 60% and I think it's probably likely kind of be that gradual improvement as we work through FY '25, I think it's kind of our best estimate at this stage. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Mick, can you hear me all right? Michael Farrell : Can hear you loud and clear, Suraj. Suraj Kalia : Perfect. Congrats on a nice quarter. So, Mick, if I could, I'd love to push you on one of the earlier questions about pricing impact in the quarter. If you could strip out at least give us directionally a little bit additional color, that would be great. Mick and also, if I'll throw my follow-up question also together in terms of inventory levels, how should we think about inventory levels on masks, accessories across the pond. Is there anything out of the normal? Or how would you characterize it? Thank you for taking my questions. Michael Farrell : Great. Well, I'll take the first question around pricing impact. And then Brett, you'll take the sneaky second question there around -- sneaky, I mean, by getting it in upfront, Suraj, not the question itself, on inventory levels, particularly with masking accessories. And we saw the total inventory come down, but I think it's specifically Brett on masks and accessories. So firstly, on pricing impact, look, Suraj, you and all the sell side, you guys do your investigations and you look and talk to our customers, particularly in the U.S. and ask about pricing. You know that as a company, you've followed us over the last few fiscal years, we did see cost of components go up with inflation with shipping costs that have gone -- we've had increased cost of goods sold that ResMed has had to deal with, and we've shared some of that, not all of it. We've shared some of that with our customers with some increase in pricing. Often associated directly with innovation, right? The AirSense 11 was higher priced than the AirSense 10, but it's small, it's quiter. It's more comfortable. It's more connected. It has 2-way comps. It has over-the-year upgrades. It has all these advances. And so, it has a high price point. Similarly, with new mask inventions, the F40 is out there. It's a great mask. We don't need a price discount on something that is that much better than the competition. It's the smallest full-face mask, the smallest oral nasal mask in the history, a 35-year history of ResMed. So that -- those will be at price premiums. And so don't break out the exact breakdown on devices or masks of pricing or volume. But I can tell you, the vast majority of our growth was all on volumes. It's all about getting more of the one billion-plus patients with a sleep apnea, the half billion patients with insomnia and half billion with COPD into the system, so they can get better fleet and better breathing. So we focus primarily on that screening diagnosis treatment, get the volume in, and then ASP is a component in that where we have increased costs. Look, frankly, I hope inflation comes down and costs come down, and we can share some savings with our customers because they have a tough time with reimbursement often not going up. At least the U.S. Medicare went up at the start of this year, in line with an inflation adjustment, but not all insurance companies around the world do that. And so, our job is to get more patients in to make sure the channel is profitable so that we can have more money to invest in getting awareness out to all the patients who need our help. That's my answer to the first half. Brett, over to you to talk about inventory and masks and accessories, particularly. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Yes, on inventory, we've brought the inventory levels down over the last 12 months or so. I think down to reasonably appropriate levels where we are seeing at the moment. And then inventory likely to grow more in line with revenue as we go forward. So, we feel we are in reasonable shape there. In terms of masks can accessories around that, we don't think of that too much differently. There's nothing particularly specific about it. We manage those inventory levels as we do with devices and components and so on. So, nothing particularly to call out there other than I think we've got -- we're more comfortable with inventory levels that we're at now, and we will work, for example, 12 months ago. So, I think we're in pretty good shape on inventory. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Margaret Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon, good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the question. And I'm going to apologize because it's a series of three questions, but I'm going to say pick and choose whatever you want to answer. I promise they're all connected. And it's really -- Mike, you talked about wanting to be a sleep concierge service in one of your earlier question answers. And so, the question is, one, First, is the sleep concierge service something that you will give away as a service? I assume you will, but maybe there's some ability to monetize that. And then two, how many patients do you think that those digital technologies that you referenced, how many patients could they bring into the market over what time period? Is it millions already what's your success rate in getting those patients connected to you and ultimately, on a CPAP today versus what they're -- where they're getting lost. And third, again, I apologize for the multiquestion here. But ultimately, this all kind of brings this idea of the funnel together and you guys delivered double-digit growth this quarter, I guess, is that one way to continue that as a trend and whether you want to give it numerically or not. But how do you get that over time on a longer-term basis? Thank you. Michael Farrell : Yes, Margaret, it's a great set of questions. And it really is one question, right? It's really about that demand generation and how we can as a company best leverage what is, frankly, once in a generation in the pharmaceutical cycle. And I think maybe once in a generation on the wearable cycle from consumer tech of a bolus of patients over the coming one, three, five, 10 years. So, look, yes, we want -- we aspire to be this digital health concierge and digital health concierge specifically for sleeping and breathing. Look, I mean, obviously, when we're providing technology, if we're providing a service that is a service that's out there in the health care field, we're going to be charging for it. But in the context of helping people find access to information, ResMed has the world's leading database with 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. We have more knowledge than anyone on the planet. I wouldn't call it a data lake, but I'd call it a data well, it's a bunch of deep, deep information about the field of sleep and breathing and about patients how they get to sleep, how they breath all night, and how they wake up and have mask leak and/or apneas and/or issues. And so with that, we want to bring that information and bring it to the world. For instance, we don't charge patients for myAir. Patients get access because we believe they paid their insurance. They -- in markets that are cash pay, they paid for that product with their own cash. So I believe they have the right to access their own data on their myAir app. So if they sign up, there's 8.3 million patients, they get myAir for free. So in a similar context, I would want patients to be able to find access to a pathway on a sort of freemium basis. If there's advanced analytics and advanced information we're doing that does. AI isn't free, a lot of engineers to write it and a lot of energy consumed in the algorithms as they run. We probably will charge for some of those advanced information similar to what we do with AirView with our providers and physicians. So sleep health concierge, there will be freemium basis and will be out there. There probably will be some pay -- for the really advanced folks. But the primary goal is to help the billion people find their path to treatment. Now to your specific questions about quantifying how many patients in the channel, how many extra have we got from consumer tech, from big pharma versus from standard referrals. We do have some analytics and measurement on that. They're internal and they're not for sort of public consumption. If I say them here on the call, they become public for them. But I can tell you we are productively paranoid about analyzing this channel. The flow of patients in where they come from and how they come from, what we can do to drive more patients in from each element of that. how we can get an ROI of either direct consumer advertising or social media-driven advertising and really track the return on that. So watch this space, a lot of investment from ResMed. It is our brand promise to help people get better sleep, better breathing and better care at home. And we're the world leader. It's our duty to do so. So I do believe, to answer the sort of third part of your question, bringing the funnel together, it is all about that. We achieved incredible growth, double-digit growth, as you said, across the business, north of 6% in devices, north of 15% in masks and incredible growth in our respiratory care -- sorry, residential care services and software at 10%. So really proud of the team. Our goal to keep doing it and keep doing it quarter in, quarter out, and the team is on it. So thanks for your question, Margaret. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live. Anthony Petrone : Thanks, Mike. Congrats on the quarter here, let me just stay on the theme high level. If you think about the debate on GLP-1, on the one hand, we still have a low diagnostic rate just for sleep apnea overall. I think it stands at 20% or so based on the last Wisconsin sleep study. So when you think about Lilly coming in here, potentially doing DTC. Where do you think the diagnostic rate can go, so that would be a huge tailwind. And then on the flip side, you think about the continuum. We have dental devices CPAP therapy, auto, CPAP, of course, in their sleep metrics on AirView, et cetera. And then we also have hypoglossal nerve stimulation. When we add in the GLP-1, how do you think the decision-making process will shake out over time? Thanks again. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for your question, Anthony. It's a broad one. It allows me to talk about diagnostics rates, but also the different sort of, as you said, continuum of care of the therapies for obstructive sleep apnea or sleep apnea in general. So yes, the Wisconsin Cohort, The Sleep Heart Health Study is a fantastic multi-decade study and really Terry Young and her colleagues have done incredibly well to have such a broad study across the field. It does talk about the United States having diagnostic rates in that 15% to 20% rate. But it is a U.S.-based study in the Sleep Heart Health Study. It's out of Wisconsin, it's U.S. based. It doesn't talk about Europe. And in Western Europe, the diagnostic rate is well south of 10% across Europe. And in Asia Pacific, MEA and rest of world and Latin America, we're less than 5% penetrated into this. And if you just look at the macro of it, right, we've got -- and we brag about it. We're so proud of having 28 million patients in our ecosystem. That's out of one billion patients worldwide. So that's 2.8% of patients in our ecosystem. And we're the world leader. We're the world leader in digital health, not just for respiratory medicine, but across the board with 19 billion nights of data. So globally, this is a single-digit penetration market. And so, I welcome firstly, patients need treatment. I welcome all alternative therapies. We're investing in all alternative therapies. We invest in CPAP, APAP, bilevel, obviously, world leader in that. We're investing in dental therapy. We're the world leader in naval 3D printed devices for Western Europe and Northern Europe, #1 in three different dental devices in those regions. And we're investing in pharma with our at need investment and we're investing in hypoglycem with our XR investment. So we want to take care of every single patient. But the goal when you talk about the continuum of care, if you're a physician, payer provider and you're looking at the holistic system, you want lowest cost most efficacious, least invasive, most reversible and the most used in terms of data of lowering death rates 39% -- sorry, 29% reduction in mortality rates that we've seen PAP across our Alaska study. So our goal is, yes, get that patient in the sleep health concierge channel, get them to the best therapy, which is start with CPAP, as you said, probably upgrade sometimes to APAP, sometimes bilevel. If you fail all of those and maybe 10% of the patients, we just can't get there, 10% plus, we then will help them find a path to dental therapy, which is the next most efficacious therapy. Then after that, based on SIM out study, probably pharma comes a little bit ahead of hypoglossal nerve stim in efficacy, right? They're talking 60% AHI reduction versus just north of 50% for some of the surgical ones. So probably third-line therapy is going to be either GLP-1 or an apnemed-type product. And I think that all of the above are great, and we're investing in all of the above. And look, if you can't tolerate the see the dental and you won't take a pill, you probably do need to have that implant because some treatments better than no treatment. And we know that if you're treated for the suffocation, you're going to have lower incidences of heart attack, stroke, all-cause mortality and you're going to be less costly to the health care system. We have dose response relationship data showing for every hour on positive airway pressure therapy. We see 7% to 8% reduction in emergency room costs. So our goal is to continue and be part of this ecosystem and help patients find their pathway to therapy. We are seeing more patients coming from this. I hope it does increase that diagnostic percentage because it's our obligation as an industry to do so. Thanks for the question, Anthony. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Yeah, good morning, Mick, Brett and Amy. Mick, can I just get you to give some commentary around the SURMOUNT-OSA write-up in the New England Journal and particularly some of those secondary endpoints as it relates to the reduction in AHI in that no disease effectively of mild disease. You mentioned the data as it relates to resupply. I was wondering if you have any data that looks at or tracks people who are giving a script for GLP-1 and CPAPs as to how many people have actually been able to come off CPAP at the end of either 12 months or 24 months? Thanks. Michael Farrell : Yes, Saul, thanks for the question. And look, we're looking at the real-world evidence every single way that we can. And yes, certainly, the SURMOUNT-OSA data had a pretty extraordinary trial, right, where they had the patients with the sleep coach, a nutrition coach, an exercise coach, they were calling them and interacting with them every day. So even people in the placebo arm had incredible reductions in weight and some really big reductions in HI in the placebo one, where they got no pharmaceutical medication, whatsoever, either saline or nothing. And so look, I think that under that circumstance, there's roughly 600 patients, plus or minus. They have some extraordinary results. But even in all those circumstances, they still weren't as good as dental devices and certainly nowhere near the 95% reduction in HI that any doctor would want with positive airway pressure therapy. But look, look, it certainly was larger than many people thought in the HR reduction. So, I think it's great. I think it means that those two companies that are investing in this are going to go through, getting the indication for use, and then they're going to be out there doing DTC advertising, which in the U.S, you can do a late-night television, and they'll be out there. They'll find some catchy tune and it'll will be out there driving patients into the funnel, and I think it will be good for all of us in the therapeutic side. We're definitely looking at the churn rates and CPAP quitters, APAP quitters, bilevel quitters and really looking in detail at it. I can tell you, in aggregate, we've seen no change on the data. And as you know, the latest generation GLP-1s, some of them have been out there one year, three years, four years plus these latest gen, and we're not seeing any increase in that. We're looking at it real-world data, and we're analyzing left, right and center, but we're not seeing an increase in quitters rates. If anything, we're seeing more motivated patients come in and holding on more. The combination therapy, which is what the primary investigators in this talk about, which is CPAP plus drug therapy as in I'm managing my weight and my suffocation are really there. And the vast majority of patients have incredible residual apnea at levels that would be treated by any primary care physician in the planet even under the very controlled circumstances of this trial, let alone what's going to actually happen in the real world. So we're watching it. We have a really strong focus on it. We've got 811,000 patients in our study. and we'll continue to publish data on it. And as we get more and more, we'll go even more to publish an American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society and get in the Blue Journal and all the big journals to have this down there in the clinical literature as well as the subjects that we're looking at in our analysis. Thanks for the question, Saul. Operator : Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us on this call. The opportunities in front of us, as you heard from all these questions, huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the health system, and this will benefit us as we help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. Thank you to all the ResMedians, who listen to this call around the world. Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to you, Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone, for listening and your questions. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This concludes ResMed's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Kevin, you may now close out the call. Operator : Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Amy, you may begin. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. As Kevin said, we are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide helpful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the reported GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to ResMed's Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell. Michael Farrell : Thanks, Amy, and welcome to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review ResMed's first quarter results for fiscal year 2025. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter of growth across all of our business segments. We've seen solid revenue growth, improved gross margins, and disciplined investments in both SG&A and R&D, resulting in very strong profit performance. The results we are presenting today reflect the hard work of the 10,000-plus ResMedians operating in over 140 countries worldwide. And the dedication they bring to improving the lives of patients, physicians, providers, and all of our customers every day. Before delving into the details of our financial and strategic initiatives, I want to emphasize that the results we are presenting here today are not just financial in nature. They represent an improvement in health outcomes for many tens of millions of people worldwide. Our mission here at ResMed is to create life-changing healthcare technologies that people love, through cloud-connectable medical devices, masks and accessories, digital health platforms, as well as ongoing investments in the latest technology, including ML and AI and GenAI. We are committed to helping hundreds of millions of people so that they can breathe better, sleep better, and live longer and higher-quality lives. Living the lives that they can to their fullest potential. Now turning to a high-level review of the financials. I'm proud to report that we delivered another strong quarter. Revenue grew by 11%, reflecting strong demand for sleep health and breathing health medical devices, our masks and accessories, as well as our residential care software offerings. We achieved double-digit revenue growth across all product and geographic categories this quarter. Masks and accessories growth was augmented by new patient activations as well as ongoing ReSupply. Our global device sales were driven by strong market performance from both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms. Our focus on operating excellence programs helped us drive operating leverage during the quarter. We achieved 27% growth in our operating profit and we further achieved 34% growth in earnings per share. We're committed to driving increased efficiencies, managing our operating expenses prudently, and investing in areas that power long-term sustainable growth. By balancing strategic investments with cost discipline, we have -- together we're driving an ongoing and sustainable profitable growth here at ResMed. Device sales remain strong, growing by a double-digit percentage year-over-year and we continue to maintain market leadership with our two AirSense platforms. We're supporting the global market and every patient or provider who needs a device has access to our market-leading 100% cloud-connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We are increasing the availability of our AirSense 11 platform worldwide with regulatory approvals expanding country-by-country. We will see ongoing momentum. Our masks and accessories business had another strong quarter, delivering 11% year-over-year growth. The AirFit F40, ResMed's smallest oronasal mask ever, continues to perform well in the U.S. market and we're expanding the F40's availability across additional global markets. The F40 has a proprietary adaptive feel technology, combined with its lightweight and compact design, it has been incredibly well-received. The F40 is praised for its fit, its comfort, and its adaptability, especially for patients who move frequently during sleep. At our Investor Day on September 30th, we announced the upcoming launch of our latest mask innovation, the AirTouch N30i. Today, I can announce that this amazing new technology will be launched into select markets next week. The AirTouch N30i is ResMed's first mask with a fabric-wrapped frame and a fabric-based patient interface with a soft breathable fabric system for optimal comfort. The way I see it, we sleep with fabric-covered pillows and fabric sheets like cotton. Why can't we have CPAP mask technology that feels just as good? We believe this mask technology will set a new standard for CPAP, APAP, and bilevel patient interface therapy and will help more people love their therapy, including how they feel in the morning and all day, all because they can achieve longer and higher-quality sleep. This technology has been years in the making and we are very proud to be able to deliver it to customers starting next week. ReSupply programs remain a critical element of our strategy to drive adherence, to improve patient outcomes, and to enhance long-term clinical results. Our digital health ecosystem empowers ReSupply through three market-leading platforms, including myAir for patients, AirView for physicians and providers, as well as Brightree for home medical equipment or HME providers. Published research shows that patients enrolled in ReSupply programs have higher therapy adherence rates in the first year and over the long term. As we expand these types of ReSupply programs globally, we expect to see continued positive impacts on patient outcomes as well as reduced overall healthcare system costs. We're proud of the progress we've made and we're excited about the opportunities in front of us. Let's now talk about two significant macro trends that we've reviewed over recent quarters, namely consumer wearables and a new class of pharmaceutical medicines called GLP-1s. We believe that both of these macro trends will have a significant impact on our business as tailwinds. Let me start with a discussion of GLP-1 medications, with a focus on the latest generation of these medicines that are targeted specifically to treat diabetes and now obesity and beyond. We've designed a real-world data analysis with now n equals 989,000 subjects, who received both a prescription for a GLP-1 medication and a prescription for positive airway pressure therapy. The results from this analysis are clear. People prescribed a GLP-1 and PAP therapy have 10.8 absolute percentage points more likelihood or propensity to commence positive airway pressure therapy, 10.8 absolute percentage points higher. Moreover, once on therapy, people with a GLP-1 prescription and a PAP prescription appear to be even more committed to long-term therapy adherence. Our analysis shows that after 12 months, the ReSupply rate for patients with GLP-1s and PAP prescriptions is 3.2 absolute percentage points higher. At 24 months, this expands even further and the ReSupply rate difference increases to 5.3 absolute percentage points higher for patients on both a GLP-1 and a PAP prescription. This suggests that patients who start GLP-1 therapy are also motivated to start and adhere to their sleep apnea treatment. As these therapies continue to expand in use, we believe that it will be a clear tailwind for our business. Next, let's turn to the consumer wearables macro trend. In July, Samsung began selling its latest generation Galaxy Watch, which now includes detection of moderate-to-severe sleep apnea. Samsung achieved de novo FDA clearance for this capability. Just last month, Apple introduced its latest generation Apple Watches with its own version of possible sleep apnea detection using actigraphy technology tracked over multiple weeks as its detection method. It's incredible to have two world-leading consumer technology companies recognize the importance of tracking sleep health and identifying sleep apnea. In addition to these technologies from Apple and Samsung, other wearables like Google's Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Whoop, and beyond are focusing on sleep health tracking. We see this investment by consumer wearable companies as an incredible once-in-a-generation opportunity for sleep health and breathing health awareness, and particularly for sleep apnea awareness. We believe that these technologies will help drive more patients to seek out information regarding their sleep health and breathing health. ResMed's obligation is to help these sleep health and breathing health consumers find their own pathway to appropriate diagnosis and treatment for sleep apnea, where ResMed leads the world with the most clinically effective, the most non-invasive, the most proven, and the most cost-effective solutions for care. Our strong competitive position here at ResMed is underpinned by continuous innovation, our commitment to patient care, and our digital health ecosystem. We've made significant investments in our product offerings, including the expansion of the availability of cloud-connectable devices, the integration of artificial intelligence into our latest and greatest digital offerings, and the scaling of our digital health tools, such as our patient management system called AirView and our consumer engagement application called myAir, which now has over 8.8 million users globally. Additionally, we recently announced the ability to integrate our own wearable home sleep apnea test system that's called NightOwl with our myAir platform. This will enable a more streamlined diagnosis process and provide improved consumer engagement on their path to therapy. Let's now turn to our long-term vision for growth, what we call our ResMed 2030 strategy. As we outlined during our recent Investor Day just over three weeks ago at the New York Stock Exchange, this strategy is centered on three key pillars : one, growing and differentiating our core sleep health and breathing health business; two, expanding into near and adjacent areas; and three, leveraging our leadership in digital health to drive better outcomes for patients, physicians, providers, and payers. Let me cover some high-level thoughts on each of these three pillars, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett, and after that, we'll go into our Q&A session. So one, sleep health and breathing health. Here at ResMed, we are laser-focused on maintaining and expanding our global leadership in sleep health and breathing health. Our goal is to bring the best products to market, products that are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected, and the most intelligent. The term CPAP has traditionally stood for continuous positive airway pressure. Taking some artistic license, I would propose that it now stands for computerized positive airway pressure. And the smarts go beyond the devices themselves. By liberating the data to the cloud, here at ResMed, we can engage with patients, with physicians, providers, and whole healthcare systems like never before. We now have approximately 20 billion nights of sleep health and breathing health data in the cloud, and we have more than 27 million 100% cloud-connectable devices that we have provided in over 140 countries worldwide. This allows us to partner with patients, physicians, providers, and beyond with unparalleled insights, ultimately leading to better product and better software offerings that help patients and their caregivers achieve better health outcomes, lower costs for the overall healthcare system, and better management of chronic diseases. Second, health technology at home. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions for care delivered right where people live and often that's right in their own home. We are introducing the basic power of machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as more advanced generative AI to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Through platforms like myAir and AirView, as well as our broad residential care software offerings, including go-to-market product brands like Brightree, MatrixCare, or MEDIFOX DAN, we are making healthcare more accessible, more efficient, and more patient-centered. We're also developing AI-driven solutions to further personalize healthcare and improve therapy adherence. Let me briefly update on two in-market products in this AI-driven space. Our compliance coach digital offering is helping home medical equipment providers identify the most at-risk patients for adherence issues and is making a significant impact to help deliver timely interventions to improve therapy outcomes for patients as well as their physicians and their providers. Our latest generative AI-driven consumer product that we call Dawn, is helping more people get access to the information they need. And to answer questions they have about their own personal sleep health, breathing health, and beyond. After just a few months of Dawn being launched into our U.S. market, we've seen 25% of visitors initiate a session with Dawn. This has led to an extraordinary 40% reduction in the volume of direct-to-live human contact center queries, allowing tech to do what tech does best and our people to connect with customers how they connect best as humans. The bottom line is these technologies represent higher quality, better outcomes, and lower costs for the healthcare system and we are just getting started. Three, expanding into adjacencies. We are investing in adjacent areas, including insomnia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, and other respiratory insufficiency fields, including neuromuscular disease and beyond. With an aging population and an increasing incidence of chronic diseases, these areas represent significant growth opportunities. We continue to expand our cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia or CBTi offerings with a product called Somnoware, while also looking at other novel technologies in the market for the 860 million people worldwide who suffer from insomnia, the inability to get to sleep and stay asleep. We're also building on our leadership in non-invasive ventilation for COPD patients to help develop new pathways for high-flow therapy in the home. The 480 million people who suffer from COPD urgently need better therapy and we are working on it. We also believe there is a significant opportunity for ResMed to capitalize on the growing trend of people worldwide seeking better sleep health regardless of whether they have clinically significant sleep apnea. And we're excited to explore what this means for ResMed as we build on our leadership in sleep apnea to extend more broadly into global sleep health, breathing health, and in fact, all health technology that's delivered in the home. As we look ahead, we are more energized than ever by the opportunities in front of us. The global demand for sleep health and breathing health solutions is growing. And our mission to help people sleep better, breathe better, and live higher-quality lives to their fullest potential continues to drive everything we do. We have updated our goal aligned with our 2030 strategy, and we now plan to empower over 500 million people to reach their fullest potential in 2030 with sleep health, breathing health, and health tech at home. With our strong financial foundation, our innovative product pipeline, and our expanding digital health ecosystem, we are best positioned to achieve that goal. ResMed is at the forefront of a rapidly evolving healthcare technology landscape. We're leading with improving patient outcomes, applying new technology, and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you to the 10,000-plus ResMedians whose hard work and dedication make our mission possible and thank you to you, our shareholders for your continued trust and support. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for a deeper dive into our financials and then we'll open the floor up for questions. Brett, over to you. Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had a strong financial performance in Q1. Group revenue for the September quarter was $1.22 billion, an increase of 11% on both a headline and constant currency basis. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and ReSupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $4 million during the September quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Residential Care Software business, sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 11%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other regions increased by 10%. Globally, device sales increased by 10%, while masks and other sales increased by 11%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America increased by 11%, supported by solid ongoing new patient demand. Masks and other sales increased by 10%, reflecting growth in both ReSupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia, and other regions, device sales increased by 9% on a constant-currency basis, while masks and other sales increased by 11%. Residential Care Software revenue increased by 12% in the September quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME software vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 320 basis points to 59.2% in the September quarter. The increase was primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies and component cost improvements and an increase in average selling prices. Sequentially, gross margin was broadly consistent with last quarter. We continue to monitor potential headwinds that could arise from the Middle East conflict and congestion in Asian ports. We expect increased air and sea freight costs will continue to impact our gross margin throughout fiscal year 2025. However, we have made good progress expanding gross margin over the last 12 months and we are focused on driving initiatives to further improve our gross margin. Looking forward, we continue to expect gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in fiscal year 2025. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 7%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.5% compared to 20.2% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year 2025. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.5% compared to 6.9% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 27%, underpinned by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $1.7 million. Given our low debt levels, we expect net interest expense to be less than $1 million in the second quarter. Additionally, we will likely generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 19.2%. We estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the September quarter increased by 35% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 34%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $326 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $426 million. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $30 million. We have now repaid our variable debt and our term debt remains at attractive interest rates relative to the current market. On September 30, we had $677 million in gross debt and $251 million in net debt, and we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. During the quarter, we purchased 222,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to purchase shares to the value of approximately $75 million per quarter through the remainder of fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions, and continue our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. Amy Wakeham : Great. Thank you, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call over to you to provide the instructions again and run the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Your line is now live. Laura Sutcliffe : Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one. Do you have any sense of pre-orders for your new mask? I know it's not available yet, but any sense of what demand looks like for that product? Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Laura. You know it's de-minimis at this point in terms of not material to the global financials. And so we don't release information like that. But what I can tell you is that we have shown this technology to our commercial teams in our big markets where it's going to launch next week. And there's incredible excitement. The marketing team have put together some fantastic programs. The sales team are ready to take it to customers. But most important here is the product engineering teams and the product management teams. This has been over a decade in development, it's really hard to take fabric and custom apply it onto Liquid Silicon Rubber and do that at scale. The scale that ResMed needs to launch a mask like this to the global market. So I'm really excited about this technology. As a personal user of these types of devices, the idea of moving from a rubber type or a plastic type product to fabric is incredible. I truly think this is a game changer, but very early days, and nothing material to report at this point other than the great technology and the excitement of the commercial team. Thanks for the question, Laura. Laura Sutcliffe : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live. Craig, your line... Michael Farrell : Craig, if you are there you might be on mute. Craig Wong-Pan: Yes. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on the rest of world devices growth. 9% growth is good growth there. I was wondering if there was much benefit coming through from AirSense 11 sales given that they are higher priced. Or if not, could you just explain some of the kind of growth drivers there for rest of world devices? Michael Farrell : Yes. Look, Craig, as you know, that's Europe, Asia-Pac and rest of world. So there's quite a lot that goes into that 9% number, certainly very strong. We think we're holding share or taking share in the sort of 140 countries that are included in that broad group of countries. What I can tell you is, it's full competition. All players are in those markets and we're loving that global competition and we're loving having the smallest, quietest, and the most comfortable devices. As you alluded to in your question, there is obviously some combination of the switch from AirSense 10 to AirSense 11 in the countries where that's improved and that has a higher price and a lower COGS point. And so there are some advantages to that. And in the revenue line, you'll see some of that. But I can tell you the vast majority of that -- the vast, vast, vast majority of that is volume and just the growth that we're able to achieve and that we're driving through demand, gen demand capture, and demand conversion in global markets. And I'm really just proud of Andrew Huxter and the team in Europe and Tony Lou in the team in Asia-Pac, they're just up there and performing really well and excited to -- 12 months in their new role is just really excelling. So great to see that. Thanks for the question, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, it's Jimmy on for Margaret. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter here. Mick, I wanted to maybe touch on devices here, and it's great to see double-digit growth worldwide. As you've digested the drivers of the strength this quarter and maybe determine what you attribute the strength to. Are you seeing any pull-through from Samsung or the spotlight that GLPs are putting on OSA? And maybe just talk to some of the confidence that might be giving you as you look at how ResMed is trying to make an impact in growing the market longer term? Michael Farrell : Yes, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. It's a good one. It allows us to talk to those macro trends and also sort of the micro, what happened these last 90 days. Firstly on the micro, look, U.S., Canada, Latin America device growth was exceptional at 11%. Just want to be clear, that's on a comp of 2% from this time a year ago. So in Q1 2024, we had 2% growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America. So very good growth at 11%, but it's on a relatively low comp. So won't take over credit for that. But what I will say is that we're definitely holding share and taking share in those markets and it's great to have the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. So we can have the number one rated device in the world, which is the AirSense 11, and the number two rated device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 available for sale there. So I think that has a combination of it. To the specific part of your question around Samsung with their de novo clearance earlier in the year and then Apple with their most recent launch of their latest watch with S, possible sleep apnea detection, and Samsung with de novo FDA clearance for moderate-to-severe sleep apnea detection. I think it's very early days in those new technologies. They've just been rolled out. I think there's a long runway to go as they get them out there. In a long runway, if you think about the analog being Apple Watch launching an EKG capability, what, 5, 5.5 years ago, and it's really now just starting to get good flow-through cardiology. I think it will go faster than that, but it won't be sort of in this one or two quarters since Samsung and just a quarter or less since Apple launched theirs and so really early days there. Look, I do think the GLP-1 trend of getting patients into primary care is helping and we're tracking 989,000 patients now with combo prescriptions for GLP-1s and those PAP and those are having some tailwind effects. So all of these macro trends are positive. What I can tell you is, I think it's just getting awareness out there. All this talks to the importance of sleep health, breathing health, and that people are thinking about it. Big consumer tech companies, big pharmas are thinking about it and people in general are and they're coming into the healthcare system and they're getting those prescriptions. So really excited about 11% growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America on a 2% comp, really excited about Europe, Asia, and rest of world growth of 9% and global growth of 10% constant currency in our devices category. And look, I'll give credit to the team. I think the team has done a great job commercially and a great job with our partners in home care providers, physicians getting prescriptions, and helping to expand the diagnostic funnel. Again, early days, we're excited about the flow and really, really proud to report these numbers. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. David Low : Thanks very much. Mick, perhaps a similar topic. Mask sales for the last year or so have been double-digit. I'm looking particularly the North American market. Just wondering if you could talk about the drivers there. I mean, what comes to mind is master patient is increasing, adherence is increasing and perhaps ResMed's market share is increasing. Can I get a touch on what you think the drivers are and maybe talk a little bit about what to expect in the future, please? Michael Farrell : Yes, David, it's a good question. You helped me answer it with three of the areas where that growth is coming from. Yes, I mean, look, masks and accessories growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America was at 10%, really solid. That was on an extraordinary comp of 23% from Q1 '24 a year ago. And so as you said, solid ongoing double-digits on double-digits growth there. And look, it is, it's a combination of new patients. We're seeing new patient flow to be pretty solid into the system. It's a combination of that plus ReSupply. We are expanding Brightree ReSupply. We're expanding Snap to every Brightree customer that wants it. We actually said three weeks ago at our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange, we're going to launch Snap Technologies even to non-Brightree customers. We're going to make it operable with whatever ERP-type management system you're using for your HME. We've got a really good share with Brightree, but if you're not using Brightree, we don't have to convert to Brightree, although we want to -- we to put you on Snap. And so that's a new advance there on ReSupply. So runway left there. Yes, I think the masks per patient per year is going up, but there is still a lot of room. I think there's a lot of people. I mean, I talk to them anecdotally, but if you go out and do your channel checks and research, not everybody knows that reimbursement will pay for two, three, or even four mask systems per year and some people are still getting one mask system per year or less. And so there's a lot of room to improve. Some people are on those programs and they love it and they get on the subscription ones. I love it because it's an overlap of altruism with the profit motive. The only reason someone is going to buy a new mask is if they're getting good care and pay that co-pay and go through the sign-off that they have to do. So really good growth there of 10% in U.S., Canada, and Latin America. But I'm also really proud of Europe, Asia, and rest of world, where we don't have all those systems like Brightree and Snap Technologies and all the sort of sophistication that we have with our U.S. HME channel partners. And we have to do it sort of through different methodologies and subscription models and/or direct engagement through home care providers or direct engagement to the consumers, the patients themselves. And so global growth of 11% really solid. Look, we still see the market growth as mid-single digits on devices and high-single digits on masks. But what you saw is this quarter, ResMed doesn't accept market growth, we drive it. And the third part you said around share, yes, look, this isn't carbonated beverages industry in Coke versus Pepsi or McDonald's versus KFC. This is really around expanding the pie. And so, yes, we've done very well in share, have extraordinary good share in AirSense 10, AirSense 11, and our new masks, the F40, great share there in full phase and I think we'll continue to take some points. But for me, it's less about that, I want to do that. Every day, we fight for share of devices and masks. But more and more, it's about 1 billion people suffocating worldwide. And we're really happy to say we've sold 28 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices. That's 2.8% of the potential, throw in the rest of the market, we're less than 5% into this global market. And so our biggest opportunity is getting more patients into the funnel. I'm loving that big tech from the consumer side and big pharma are going to bring more patients in and that's ResMed's job to help those people find the pathway through as I said in the prep remarks. That's how we'll be able to sustain the sort of as we said in our Investor Day, high-single-digit growth for ResMed and then better growth than that in terms of our profit and better growth in that in our free cash flow and earnings per share. Thanks for the question, David. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live. Saul Hadassin : Good morning. Good afternoon, Mick and Brett. Can you hear me? Michael Farrell : Hear you loud and clear, Saul. Saul Hadassin : Thanks, Mick. Maybe one for Brett. Brett, just on working capital, it looked like it was a bit of a headwind this quarter as it related to your operating cash flow and in particular some inventory build. Can you just talk to -- is there sort of just seasonality in this? Is it just some inventory build as it relates to new product launch or any other issues that you're seeing as it relates to the cost of that inventory that's coming through the balance sheet? Thank you. Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Saul. Yes, a little bit of increase in our inventory, if you looked at it sequentially on the working capital. What we've done is we're really in the process of rebalancing on sea freight, air freight and particularly trying to mitigate some of those increased freight costs and freight rates. So we've increased some stock in transit, which is on the sea, which is increasing our inventory levels in the short term. There may be a little more of an increase in Q2, but then we think it will be pretty stable after that. It's just a process of balancing that. So part of what we're trying to do to mitigate some of those freight costs. Saul Hadassin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho. Hope your line is now live. Anthony Petrone : Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on the quarter, and thanks again for all the feedback at the Analyst Day. Maybe a quick one, Mick, on pricing, Mick or Brett. Last year, you put in some price increases, both devices and ReSupply and I think we're approaching the anniversary of a few of those price actions last year. So maybe just a little bit on the pricing strategy going forward. Is that going to be a part of the steady diet? And if I could sneak one in there as well, just U.S. DME purchasing patterns, are they holding more inventory and buying more in bulk just because of the supply situation out there? Thanks again, and congratulations. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks, Anthony. I'll have a go at both questions. And Brett, feel free to chime in. Anthony is opening up for both of us. But firstly on pricing strategy, look, as we saw during the supply-chain crisis, the impacts on electrical components availability and cost and specifically around semiconductors and comms chips, some really specific price increases we saw from our channel. And as Brett alluded to in his last answer, increase in freight costs -- air freight costs and availability and sea freight costs and availability over the last four, eight, 12 quarters have really flowed into our inventory and had a big hit on us. And so -- and we took that hit. Four, five quarters ago, you saw us take significant hits from that. We are working through that. And so look, as we worked with our customers, we shared some of the pain of those price increases that we saw. We took some of the hit, frankly at ResMed as the market saw and we passed on some of that in saying, look, these costs have gone up. They've gone up for everything, forever, bread, milk, bananas, fruits. I mean, it's happened. And frankly, it's interesting to me on the retail side, not all of them have lowered their prices as things have started to come down. Here at ResMed, look, we're in the healthcare industry. We understand this is controlled reimbursement many countries by governments and private payers. And so we partner up with our channel to say, look, what's happening. And so we shared some of that pain there. I think things are starting to level out somewhat as you saw in our costs. We're managing air freight better, sea freight better. We're moving our way through those high-cost components. We're always wary of what could happen with Red Sea issues and Panama Canal issues and even a seaport threat of a union strike just last month. And so we're watching it with a productive sense of paranoia. But what I can tell you is, Shane Azzi, our new Chief Supply Chain Officer is all over this, and we've got plans to mitigate and Brett led that group the last six months. So really good communication between our finance team and our supply chain team. So we're all over this. And I think in terms of pricing, sure, you will see some maybe increases in pricing in components and parts where the costs are still high. I'm thinking like tubing and humidifiers in areas where there is just relatively higher costs relative to where we price them. But in general, I think it will be a benign pricing environment. To the second question about U.S. HME purchasing patterns. No, we really haven't seen any sort of across the market change in how that happens. I mean, there are customers like in Japan, particularly with our large customers there, they tend to buy large bulk purchases and then work through sort of an inventory fleet management system, if you think for the CPAPs, APAPs, and buy levels and certainly on the ventilators and certainly on the mask side, they then have some level of inventory stocking in Japan. But in the U.S., even the large customers, we partner up very well. We look at our supply chain, they don't want to hold excess inventory. We don't want to hold excess inventory. So as we can, it's not a just-in-time market. I worked in chemicals and steel and mining industries where it was just-in-time minimum available and just make sure it's just there in time. This is healthcare. If somebody misses out on that product, they may not get a life-changing healthcare technology. So we want to make sure it's available. As Brett said, we have some levels of inventory reasonably high, but we are looking at efficiency of the supply chain for us and our customers. So no major change in U.S. HME purchasing patterns. And our goal is to make sure that it's as just-in-time as possible with no patient left behind. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Daniel Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live. Daniel Hurren : Good morning. Thanks very much. Look, we've noticed that the term tuck. Sorry, can you hear me? Michael Farrell : Yes. Got you loud and clear, Dan. Daniel Hurren : Thanks. Thanks, Mick. Look, we've noticed that this term tuck-in acquisition has become very common in your commentary. And then in the presentation, you pointed out the $1.5 billion in debt capacity. So I was hoping you could talk just to the M&A priorities and the scale of the M&A priorities, I guess, and how you think about capital management as the free cash really start to ramp up over the next 12 months as that debt is retired. Michael Farrell : Okay, Dan. Well, I'll take the first part of that question about tuck-in M&A and I'll hand it to Brett to talk about capital management more broadly as our CFO and he sleeps and breathes that. In terms of tuck-in acquisitions, obviously, I'm not going to go into details of our radar and what we're looking at, and conversations we're having. But what I will talk about is what we've done in terms of successful tuck-in acquisitions. So if you look at what we did sort of around three, four years ago with Snap Technologies, that was a tuck-in acquisition. It was de-minimis in terms of the number. I don't think we even published the number. It was relatively small in terms of our annual cash flow. But what it did was it gave us the ability to engage with HMEs and engage with their customers, the patients in ways that we hadn't ever before and brought new technology. So it improved both Brightree's sort of Residential Care Software as a service business, but it also improved our core sleep health and breathing health business by making sure people when they wanted a new mask could easily and capably get approval, co-pays made, all the Is dotted and Ts cross for the healthcare system and then get the product needed that they could get. So we are absolutely out there on the lookout for acquisitions like Snap. Another tuck-in acquisition I'll talk about is called Somnoware. Somnoware is software for pulmonary and sleep medicine physician practices across the respiratory sections, so sleep apnea, COPD, and beyond, all sort of sleep health and breathing health. Again, de-minimis in that we didn't release the total number, we didn't need to, but we got amazing capabilities with that acquisition. A team of engineers here in the U.S. and in India and actually a great entrepreneur in Subath, who joined our team. I first met him at a SLEEP meeting maybe 15 years ago. And he said, I think at that time, you're going to need us, you're going to buy our technology. And he was right. It was a decade and a half later, but that was a great tuck-in acquisition and Subath has the office right next door to me and he's looking at our incubation and growth and looking at tuck-in acquisitions that are just like the company that he had. So he's out there at conferences like Health and CES along with Carlos Nunez and the rest of our team to look out what those tuck-ins might be. But Somnoware allows us to engage with pulmonary doctors earlier and earlier on this sort of end-to-end digital sleep health concierge process that ResMed wants to be. We're getting earlier and earlier in that with our Somnoware acquisition. The final one I'll talk about, I could talk all day on it, but our final one for this is a tuck-in M&A that we did of a technology from a company called Ectosense and the technology is called NightOwl. And I actually just talked in the prep remarks about how we've just integrated NightOwl with myAir, the myAir platform, the patient consumer app, and NightOwl. NightOwl is a home sleep apnea test that is basically a wearable. I mean, it's the size of a band-aid with a sensor that goes on your finger. And with that connected to your smartphone, we can get very high sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity and specificity are well higher than you get from some of these other wearables I talked about from consumer tech companies because we're doing different things. They're both FDA, 510 cleared devices, but ours is designed to be a diagnostic, a home sleep apnea test that can be a diagnostic, and a prescription written from a pulmonary physician. Great tuck-in acquisition. Again, we didn't release the number, it was relatively small and that's why it's a tuck-in. But that technology is scaled by ResMed in 140 countries and we're just ready to relaunch it here in the U.S. market. I think the timing couldn't be better because if Samsung and Apple get these people thinking, oh, possible sleep apnea from my phone or maybe I've got this moderate sleep apnea infection, where do I go? Well, guess what? They go to a primary care physician or they go to a sleep physician and then we need digital scalable models for them. So a product like NightOwl helps with that. And we're creating not just in our own diagnostics, but a portfolio of capabilities with other diagnostics companies and service providers in the U.S. and beyond because that digital sleep health concierge is an obligation for ResMed. People are going to come with problems of sleep health and breathing health. We don't want them waiting in a do-loop. We want them taken care of. So they are the sort of three examples of tuck-in acquisitions and more to come on that. Brett, in terms of capital allocation, any thoughts to share with Dan on a broader level? Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. And Dan, when you think about the tuck-ins we've got and Mick articulated some great examples, which we think are going to add a ton of value over time, and we're continuously looking at these sort of acquisitions. But in terms of quantum tuck-in, I guess, that's fairly broad, $100 million -- $200 million, it could be given our balance sheet and size now, it could be up to $500 million, Dan. It just depends what the acquisitions strategically like, financially like, culturally like, and then what sort of capability it can bring into ResMed and how we might leverage that. So we think pretty hard about it before we actually make the acquisition. But it's been really good acquisitions over the last two or three years and there's more out there as the market continues to develop. So anything in that range, I think we would look at. And then the other side on capital management and you heard my comments earlier, we will increase the buyback each quarter going forward and that obviously remains a lever for us going forward. So that's kind of the two areas, I guess, will -- well, three really. Fundamentally R&D investment where we get -- that's the greatest return we get. We'll look at, as Mick said, we'll look at the tuck-in acquisitions and then we'll do some capital management as well. That's kind of the three areas of focus. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Mike Matson : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I just wanted to ask one. So with the new - on masks with the new N30i with that fabric over the straps, is that a technology that you can apply to other masks in your portfolio? And then is that something that you're able to get a price premium for? Michael Farrell : Yes, it's a great question, Mike, and thanks for coming to our Investor Day. You were able to touch and see that product because I think you've really got to touch and see what the AirTouch N30i is. It's in its name, right? It's an AirTouch. That fabric is -- it's extraordinarily advanced technology. As I said, we've been looking for a decade at fabrics and how to get them at scale and with efficacy on a mask that could be ResMed quality, and we were able to bring that to market. To your question, can we apply that technology to other masks? Absolutely. I think this is a game changer and it changes the basis of competition for how patient interfaces are delivered from plastics and rubbers sort of medical-type products that you might find in a hospital to ones that you might find at home. People sleep on cotton or silk fabric sheets. They have a cotton-covered pillow. They don't sleep on plastic, why should that part be delivering care on your face? If we can get the pneumatic stent at safety, efficacious, and long-term capability. But to your question, yes, it is a higher cost. It's more difficult to have these machinery robotics and scalable systems that can do this even with ResMed having the biggest manufacturing footprint on the planet in the field of respiratory medicine, sleep health, and breathing health, it's costs are still higher with a new technology like this. So pricing will be slightly higher for these types of products because the costs are higher. But I think what you'll find is that first-time fit rates will go up, that return rates will go down, and that adherence rates will go up. As we do with all our technology, that's the goal, lower the cost of the overall healthcare system, improve adherence, which means less chances of heart attack, stroke, less chances of death as we've shown in the Alaska study for patients who are adherent on CPAP versus not. And we think that these types of improvements will have a huge return on investment for the patient, for the physician, for the provider as we launch them to market. So yes, the AirTouch N30i is coming out. It will have a price premium because it's got a higher cost. We can't take it to other masks and we will over time. But early days, we're just launching it next week. Lots of interest and excitement from our commercial team and the customers who sort of got a sneak preview and we're excited about AirTouch N30i and what it can do more broadly across the world. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Brett Fishbin : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the macro tailwind around the wearable tech platforms. You've talked about it a bunch at the Investor Day and then again on today's call. I was just curious if you could maybe touch on a few potential strategies that the company could be looking at that would best position ResMed to capture potential increases in new patient demand driven by the adoption of these technologies. Thank you so much for taking the question. Michael Farrell : Yes, it's a great question, Brett. I mean, it's a complex answer. It could take all of the eight minutes we got less left on the call and longer. But as you heard in the sort of four-hour overview that we gave on our Investor Day three weeks ago, there is lots of things we're doing in this. The broad categories are demand generation, demand capture, and demand conversion, three areas. Now if big tech and big pharma are taking on some of that demand gen, right, driving people into PCPs, driving people into our specialist sleep physicians, then what we have to do at ResMed is take the next phase in that. So what we have to do is have products like Dawn, our generative AI interaction format that can talk and engage with patients to help them if they've just got sleep health questions about getting better sleep, drinking more water, exercising more, less alcohol after certain times, less caffeine after certain times, different food and timing of food intake, all these types of broader sleep health can be conducted by a bot at levels that are just human banks of callers don't have time for and don't spend as much time on and people can be embarrassed to ask some questions about sleep health and breathing health. There's a stigma associated with all healthcare and that's why companies like Hims & Hers and all these other type of digital platforms are out there and achieving some success. And so ResMed wants to be that digital sleep health concierge. And the -- as I said, the answer is complex. It's more than just DAN, it's more than just Somnoware, it's more than just myAir, it's more than just AirView and the whole combination. But it is those components and it's how you stitch them together and how you create that seamless, frictionless end-to-end experience for a person. Let's not call them a consumer. Let's not call them a patient. Let's say it's a person who suffocates and is looking for their own care, all their spouse and bed partners care. And so we're really focused on this and we think these macro trends are going to drive patients in, consumers in, persons in. And ResMed's job is to do the best job at demand capture and demand conversion. We've got many experiments around 140 countries and we'll update you. It's not going to be a one-hit wonder, oh, here we got the panacea and it's this. No, there's going to be multiple attempts in different areas, different MSAs, different technologies, different healthcare systems. Every person is different. All of the 1 billion people with sleep apnea, the 2.3 billion with sleep apnea or insomnia or COPD or some combination of the above with respiratory insufficiency, they all need an individualized personalized pathway to better sleep, better health, and better health technology at home. So ResMed's goal is to capture across that with a combination of technologies. And as we launch them and as the experiments are successful, we'll let you know. I want to be clear, this isn't just about brand awareness and brand driving. This is about brand ROI, return on investment that we show the experiments are successful that the people see the ResMed brand, they engage with them and then they find a path to better sleep health and breathing health. And we're best positioned globally to do this with our market share and capability. If we did nothing, we'd get good share. I think our goal and our obligation is to do a lot and to drive more patients in and to help them find that best path that they can have. Thanks for the question, Brett. And sorry to trivialize the answer with only a four-minute answer, but we probably got time for a couple of more questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Suraj Kalia : Hi, Mick, Brett, hope you're well. So my congrats\u2026 Michael Farrell : Thanks very much, Suraj. Suraj Kalia : Congrats on a great quarter. Mick, I want to piggyback on Anthony's question, right? So your normal -- your nominal growth right now is a perfect trifecta of pushing more ReSupply masks to patient price increases. And I believe Brett mentioned something about a little bit of inventory also to cater to patients just in time. Mick, as we think forward, how do you -- how would you say ResMed is buffered from a potentially more price-sensitive environment if and when Philips returns to the market? Thank you for taking my questions and congrats again. Michael Farrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Suraj. Look, as you said, there is some really interesting overlays between our more masks and the technology we're bringing to market, our pricing strategies, and our inventory management strategies. With regard to the competitor you mentioned, look, as I said, we just announced pretty good growth in Europe, Asia, rest-of-world, right, 9% growth in devices, 11% growth in masks and accessories. That competitor is available in almost all of the 140 countries we're in, and they've been there for many, many, many quarters. And so love them. I love to compete with them. I love to beat them. I do the same with all the other competitors. I love the players from Europe and Asia. Competition is a fantastic thing for ResMed. We love it. It keeps us on our toes. And we were beating that particular competitor all the way from 2001 through to 2021 as they had the recall in the U.S. in devices, which is the only area, right? So we've been ongoing competition with them in masks the whole time and they've been out for a couple of years, two to three years now in devices. Look, I look forward to them coming back here. They'll have to fight for that number two, number three position against some other players with importing product from China and Europe that they've sort of taken that number two, number three position. And I think they've got to set up new manufacturing and get new sales team and I look forward to them coming back. We will be beating them before their recall and we will beat them after. But look, I don't spend that much time or my time looking back at the competition from Europe or Asia or that particular player from Europe. I look more forward and I think about these macro trends and what we can do to take care because this isn't just a share game. What we've got is a sustainable competitive advantage in a digital health ecosystem that patients engaging with myAir, doctors engaging with AirView and more importantly, consumers, persons who just suffocate coming in, they don't know where they want to go. We want to help them find that pathway and be objective about it and then they will choose the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected, and most intelligent therapies. That's how ResMed competes and that's how ResMed wins. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Lyanne Harrison : Good morning all and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Can you comment a little bit on the production of AirSense 11? You mentioned you're increasing and you're targeting it to come off allocation at the end of this calendar year. Is that still on track? And then also, can you comment on the mix of AS11 to AS10 devices that you're selling in the United States? And do you have a sense that there might be a [rePAP] backlog waiting for the AirSense 11 still? Michael Farrell : Thanks, Lyanne. Yes, there is a lot in that question and we're almost right on time. We may have one more question I think. So yes, as you said, production of AirSense 11 is firing on all cylinders. Our Singapore plant, which as I said earlier, is the largest manufacturing plant in the world for respiratory medical care that thing is pumping out and really at full capacity. And I'm really excited to have AirSense 11s coming off that line and AirSense 10s coming out of there in Sydney and beyond and through Atlanta and through our distribution centers throughout Asia and Europe. And so to your specific question, AirSense 11 firing and really, really strong rate limiters to growth are just that we're the number one and number two player between AirSense 11 and AirSense 10 in many of these markets. And so there is a mix, as you said. In the U.S. specifically, you asked Lyanne, well over 50%, vast majority of products sold in the U.S. are AirSense 11s. To the final part of your question, do we think that there are people sort of at that, oh, I've been on therapy for five years and insurance will pay for a new one, I'm waiting until AirSense 11 is available? Yes, maybe some -- a little bit of a backlog with some particular consumers. But if you really want one, a consumer at that level might be going to one of the online dealers or looking at other ways to make sure they get in line for an AirSense 11. So I think there's always a bit of a backlog. I always think that rePAP opportunity is huge for us. We don't spend enough time on it. Our customers don't spend enough time on it. We've gotten really sophisticated at ongoing ReSupply for masks, tubing, and accessories. I think we need to be better at rePAP on a regular basis. And so it's a good call out and the team are on it with many things going on to make sure that as we get full AirSense 11 capabilities, everyone who's at that five-year point gets the chance to say, yes, I want the latest and greatest therapy, smallest, quietest most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent, and that's the AirSense 11. So we will continue to do that. As I said in the prep remarks, I think there's a long runway, lots of momentum left on the AirSense 11. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Andrew Paine from CLSA. Your line is now live. Andrew Paine : Question, look just going back to the rest of world devices and just thinking about the AE sales, just be good to get some views on competition that you're seeing in the region, in particular, if you're seeing a declining presence from Philips in some of these markets, which would open you up to taking larger market share? Michael Farrell : Yes, Thanks for the question, Andrew. And yes, look, we're competing with another particular European player, probably a little bit more than the one you mentioned, but we're competing with both of them very well as you saw with Europe, Asia, rest of world device growth at 9%. We don't break that out and say exactly what component of that is Europe versus Asia-Pac versus rest of world and we did have very good growth in our Japan markets and China markets and other parts of Asia-Pac. But Europe is doing very well. As I said, I'm really proud of the team there. We've really brought together our pan-European management team over these last 12 months under our Global Chief Revenue Officer, Mike Fliss, and our regional leader there in Andrew Huxter. And I think that combination of communication and partnership across our team has allowed us to provide customers even more seamless and better service, better marketing, better sales, better delivery of products. And we've not always been the best in that final mile of delivery, that final kilometer of delivery that we need to have in Europe and we're getting better and better at it. So I think it's a combination of the products, AirSense 11, the communication through our commercial teams, and the supply chain and logistics that we're really partnering up with customers that have allowed us to achieve that. The competitive environment is what it always was, but as you see in those numbers, ResMed is doing well, competing hard and winning accounts, winning tenders, and winning share. But more importantly than that, we're partnering up to ensure a good flow of patients into the funnel. That's ResMed's primary goal, more patients into the funnel, help them get best-in-class care. Thank you for the questions, team. I'll now hand the call over to Kevin. Operator : We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Mick, do you have any further or closing comments? Michael Farrell : Yes. Look, I got the prepared remarks here, I'm not going to say all that. Thanks to 10,000 ResMedians, 140 countries, you guys are doing amazing things. Thank you to all our shareholders for the support. Incredible quarter. Let's power up and let's do it again for another 90 days. And with that, Amy, I'll hand over to you to close out the call. End of Q&A: Amy Wakeham : Awesome. Thank you, Mick. Thank you everyone for listening, for your questions, and we do appreciate your interest. If you have follow-up questions or need anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. This does conclude our first quarter 2025 conference call. Kevin, you may now close the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.",
